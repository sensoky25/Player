What's going on, damn it

00:02:08,205 --> 00:02:09,889
Is it debt collection?

Guests invited today

38

It's a new book that wants to be hotly discussed

I should call you representative Lin Jinxi

42
00:05:48,243 --> 00:05:50,115
Or Lin Zhenxi writer

43
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,324
Which one do you think is better?

44
00:05:51,325 --> 00:05:54,199
Call me reporter Lin Jinxi at will.

45
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,948
My job is a reporter after all

46
00:05:55,949 --> 00:05:59,197
Okay, reporter Lin Zhenxi

47

Want to describe the truth through this book

49
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:09,363
I can guess that I wrote a lot of exciting content

50
00:06:09,364 --> 00:06:12,196
Come on, this so-called slander law

51
00:06:12,197 --> 00:06:15,446
It’s said to mean the curse of alchemy, right?

52
00:06:15,447 --> 00:06:19,655
Yes, this slander method is an alchemy to curse the other party...

53
00:06:19,656 --> 00:06:21,028
What reporter Lin said

54
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:22,862
Check out the message board here

55
00:06:22,863 --> 00:06:25,406
The audience is also very interested in it

56
00:06:25,446 --> 00:06:25,944
Right?

57
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,059
Hmph... I really want to talk and stop.
D: It was cursed because of disgust.
H: I had expectations for the Lin Zhenxi reporter. I didn't expect to choose this path... I was very depressed.
R: I hate the times, hahaha, it seems that I have a lot of time?
K: This is a current affairs show, is it a bit conceptual, okay?
T: When a reporter writes a book, he will appear on the current affairs show. Is this mutual help?
R: Confused by superstition The reporter is still on the radio show now, almost crazy

58
00:06:27,084 --> 00:06:28,320
Reporter Lin

59
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:32,862
Has the previously missing master slander contacted you?

60
00:06:32,863 --> 00:06:35,111
No, not yet

61
00:06:35,112 --> 00:06:38,987
It’s a pity that there are no strong witnesses

62
00:06:38,988 --> 00:06:41,194
Can prove if what you said is true

63
00:06:41,195 --> 00:06:42,528
It's really a pity

64
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:45,987
I hope that the master slander who heard this show can call

65
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:51,360
Then let's answer the call from the enthusiastic audience

66
00:06:51,361 --> 00:06:52,820
Oh, already...

67
00:06:52,842 --> 00:06:54,529

Forget that, Reporter Lin

72
00:07:03,609 --> 00:07:07,277
There was a weird case of dead body murder last night

73
00:07:07,277 --> 00:07:08,002
(Dead body murder?!)

74
00:07:08,051 --> 00:07:12,934

97
00:08:21,297 --> 00:08:22,103
What about representatives?

98
00:08:22,104 --> 00:08:23,393
Senior, it’s not that important now

99
00:08:23,394 --> 00:08:25,644
Don’t mention a lot of media calls

100
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:27,142
Asked if what was said in the show just now was true

101
00:08:27,143 --> 00:08:28,644
Top in search list

102
00:08:28,645 --> 00:08:31,268
I’m all asking if I’m doing this to sell books

103
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:33,308
But we are not that kind of people, are we

104
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:35,686
-Where is the representative?-It's
on the second floor

105
00:08:35,687 --> 00:08:36,599
Please wait

106
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,643
Hello, come here

107

She is a new intern this time

108
00:08:39,892 --> 00:08:41,893
Responsible for on-site shooting, say hello

Go, go

115
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:52,265
Why are you still carrying that bag?

116
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:53,349
This greeting is a bit long

117
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,357
Then please

118
00:08:54,382 --> 00:08:55,503
Seniors, come on

119
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,724
Have you found an intern?

120
00:09:00,725 --> 00:09:02,611
Well, her name is Jesse

121
00:09:02,683 --> 00:09:04,224
Have you seen it

122
00:09:04,225 --> 00:09:06,932
The salary talk goes well and there is no experience

123
00:09:06,933 --> 00:09:08,639
I heard she is an overseas Chinese

124
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,596
Have you inquired about the case mentioned on the radio just now?

125
00:09:11,597 --> 00:09:13,831
Well, the relevant information is placed there

126
00:09:13,847 --> 00:09:14,760
(The death case of Kim Jong-kyun from paralytic shellfish toxin)

127
00:09:14,784 --> 00:09:16,306
Where is the victim?

128
00:09:16,307 --> 00:09:18,162
The name of the victim is Kim Jong Kyun, 46 years old

129
00:09:18,162 --> 00:09:19,573
Direct cause of death: The method is unknown, the victim’s drug reaction was tested, and the paralytic shellfish toxin component was tested.
Indirect cause of death: traces of fighting between the suspect and the victim

130
00:09:19,598 --> 00:09:21,554
Used to be a researcher at Shengri Pharmaceutical

131
00:09:21,555 --> 00:09:23,806
Divorced four years ago

132
00:09:23,807 --> 00:09:27,098
-Shengri Pharmaceutical
-The cause of death was poison and bite marks

133
00:09:27,123 --> 00:09:29,004
Look at the picture of the murderer behind

134
00:09:30,242 --> 00:09:31,029
(Picture 4. I can’t confirm my identity because I’m a bone)

135
00:09:31,054 --> 00:09:34,595
But the autopsy result of this guy showed

136
00:09:34,596 --> 00:09:36,782
He has been dead for three months

137
00:09:37,724 --> 00:09:38,482
What?

138
00:09:38,763 --> 00:09:41,053
As the guy said

139
00:09:41,054 --> 00:09:43,544
Dead body homicide

140
00:09:49,113 --> 00:09:49,457
What about the identity of the murderer?

141
00:09:49,457 --> 00:09:50,813
(Photo 8. Top of the suspect)

142
00:09:50,844 --> 00:09:53,471
The police haven't found out his identity yet

143
00:09:53,472 --> 00:09:55,059
Let me check that

144
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,899
(Photo 10. Suspect's palm tattoo)

145
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,263
Very special tattoo

146
00:10:05,114 --> 00:10:07,969
Did you use that kind of sticker?

147
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,052
Is not

148
00:10:09,053 --> 00:10:10,717
Oh, is it so

149
00:10:10,718 --> 00:10:13,504
It should be a kind of tattoo that casts a spell

150
00:10:13,953 --> 00:10:15,581
I'll call Professor Zhuo

151
00:10:17,461 --> 00:10:20,467
I have handed it over to Professor Zhuo for identification

152
00:10:20,468 --> 00:10:21,300
Hello

153
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:22,924
-Give me, give me
-husband, husband

154
00:10:22,925 --> 00:10:23,633
Give this to me

155
00:10:23,634 --> 00:10:25,569
How did you come?

156
00:10:26,133 --> 00:10:29,382
Is today our wedding anniversary?

157
00:10:29,383 --> 00:10:31,217
Whoops, I'm really kidding, ma'am.

158
00:10:31,218 --> 00:10:32,051
Leader Zheng

159
00:10:32,052 --> 00:10:35,133
Do I congratulate you on being transferred to the wide area search team?

160
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,507
How nice after going there

161
00:10:36,508 --> 00:10:38,092
The couple can often work together

162
00:10:38,093 --> 00:10:40,014
Have been transferred for a year

163
00:10:42,197 --> 00:10:46,437
Wow, how can we find out so clearly the case information that hasn't been made public yet?

164
00:10:47,091 --> 00:10:49,035
By the way, has this really not been made public yet?

165
00:10:50,424 --> 00:10:51,922
Is it you again?

166
00:10:51,923 --> 00:10:53,281
sorry

167
00:10:53,306 --> 00:10:54,798
Anyway why are you here

168
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:57,912
Don't do the interview tomorrow

169
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,796
What are you talking about

170
00:11:02,756 --> 00:11:04,879
Why, are you so uncomfortable with your wife’s career going well?

171
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,836
Chengjun, your wife finally started a company

172
00:11:07,837 --> 00:11:10,256
I found an exclusive content for the first time, but you still said that

173
00:11:10,257 --> 00:11:12,213
Hello, look at these books, look

174
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:13,964
To increase the number of subscribers and then sell these

175
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:16,593
-The monthly rent of the office has also increased... -This is
not a normal case

176
00:11:17,298 --> 00:11:18,837
Maybe you will be in danger again

177
00:11:18,838 --> 00:11:21,353
I also know this is not an ordinary case

178
00:11:21,545 --> 00:11:24,711
But if the caller is really the murderer

179
00:11:24,712 --> 00:11:27,046
Can he prove the killing technique?

180
00:11:27,047 --> 00:11:27,919
What was the motive for the murder?

181
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,170
What motives are you talking about

182
00:11:29,171 --> 00:11:31,628
It is said that the evidence is insufficient and the prosecutors can’t prosecute it.

183
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:34,585
If you want me to say, even if you want to catch it, you have to listen to him before catching it.

184
00:11:34,586 --> 00:11:36,754
-Yeah
-Of course it must be like this

185
00:11:36,755 --> 00:11:38,378
Okay, got it

186
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:40,751
Then listen to what that guy is saying

187
00:11:40,752 --> 00:11:44,001
But our police will stand by around the interview venue

188
00:11:44,002 --> 00:11:45,386
do you know

189
00:11:45,711 --> 00:11:46,860
Got it

190
00:11:46,969 --> 00:11:47,750
Go away

191
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,124
Give you

192
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,585
- This is for you
- Jin Hee understand?

193
00:11:55,586 --> 00:11:56,458
No need, no need

194
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:59,252
Got it, got it

195
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:01,960
I listen to your instructions, don't worry

196
00:12:01,961 --> 00:12:03,254
Whoops

197
00:12:04,253 --> 00:12:06,457
-Don't you worry at all?
-Yeah

198
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,416
I'm not worried

199
00:12:07,417 --> 00:12:09,958
Because my husband makes me feel at ease

200
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:11,250
Walk slowly

201
00:12:11,251 --> 00:12:12,539
What about these books

202
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,008
-Put it on the first floor and go again
-Kim representative

203
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:17,624
The identity of the murdered corpse

204
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,689
You have to find out as soon as possible

205
00:12:19,743 --> 00:12:21,708
Reporter Lin

206
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:24,999
This is what my junior found out from other magazines

207
00:12:25,024 --> 00:12:27,131
You first look at the content sent by the other party

208
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:33,915
This is a scene of doing things in a haunted house in Shikoku, Japan

209
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,773
Look at the wizard inside

210
00:12:36,717 --> 00:12:38,746
(The mysterious girl who appeared with the wizard)

211
00:12:40,496 --> 00:12:41,493
Zhao Na

212
00:12:41,747 --> 00:12:43,622
Yeah, it seems to be her, Zhao Nao

213
00:12:43,623 --> 00:12:48,149
According to the younger generation, he disappeared after working with the Japanese wizard there temporarily.

214
00:12:49,289 --> 00:12:50,705
Really

215
00:12:50,706 --> 00:12:55,246
As long as you can find Zhao Yu, people can believe your words

216
00:12:55,247 --> 00:12:58,119
Our books can also be sold smoothly

217
00:13:26,204 --> 00:13:27,997
Can I call your sister?

218
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,744
-I am slandering the Master
-slandering the Master

219
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:33,825
That guy is a demon

220
00:13:33,826 --> 00:13:35,243
This is a battle with evil spirits

221
00:13:35,244 --> 00:13:36,991
As long as there is the picture of the evil ghost and the name in Chinese characters

222
00:13:36,992 --> 00:13:39,824
You can use the slander law if you have used it

223
00:13:39,825 --> 00:13:42,368
The fire of the fire word, the joy of joy

224
00:13:42,369 --> 00:13:45,409
Let's use slander

225
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:52,531
Go to death

226
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:54,950
I still feel guilty about using the slander law to deal with that kind of guy

227
00:13:54,951 --> 00:13:57,157
Sure enough, sister is a good person

228
00:13:57,158 --> 00:14:01,824
Sister, I will always contain this evil spirit

229
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:05,052
Zhao Na

230
00:14:06,115 --> 00:14:07,774
Don't

231
00:14:09,545 --> 00:14:10,545
Zhao Na

232
00:15:30,192 --> 00:15:32,356
Go to death

233

(Tuesday, October 17)

234
00:16:11,169 --> 00:16:15,395
Jinhee, just in case something is wrong

235
00:16:15,396 --> 00:16:18,436
Be sure to end this show, you have to remember

(Urban Detective Independent News Channel)
(Later, the independent urban detective's live broadcast will start)

237
00:16:28,562 --> 00:16:30,684
Senior, will he really show up?

238
00:16:30,685 --> 00:16:32,519
Now the number of people online has exceeded 20,000

239
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,061
If this messes up, all the previous ads will also be cancelled

240
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:37,332
Rest assured

241
00:16:37,894 --> 00:16:39,332
Will definitely come

242
00:16:40,393 --> 00:16:43,850
Don't worry, it will come, it will come, it will come

243
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,429
Don't be nervous

244
00:16:45,978 --> 00:16:47,683
Take your hand out of your pocket

245
00:16:54,435 --> 00:16:56,515
Team leader, one person is in now

246
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:59,101
Fisherman hat, wearing a gray down jacket

247
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:01,475
I wore black pants underneath

248
00:17:01,476 --> 00:17:04,516
Looks like a man in his forties

249
00:17:04,517 --> 00:17:06,307
Come on, focus on me all from now on

250
00:17:06,308 --> 00:17:07,475

Walking towards the interview venue

254
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:23,139
Should be the suspect

255
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,473

Okay, please come to the front

261
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,802
Put a microphone on for you

Today we are going to use live broadcast to interview

269

Claiming to be the real culprit in the corpse homicide two days ago

270
00:18:56,216 --> 00:18:58,758
May I ask your name?

271
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:01,549
My name is Park Yongho

272
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,823
Hello, Park Yongho

273
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:05,880
Is this real name?

No criminal records

278
00:19:14,963 --> 00:19:16,727
(Name Park Yongho, Yongin, Gyeonggi-do)
Someone reported that he was missing

279
00:19:19,052 --> 00:19:23,314
I'm the spellcaster who manipulates the corpse

280
00:19:23,797 --> 00:19:25,837
The case that happened the day before yesterday

281
00:19:25,838 --> 00:19:29,712
It's also the murder case where I manipulated the corpse

282
00:19:29,713 --> 00:19:33,588
Manipulate corpses to kill

283
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:37,004
This part is hard to believe

284
00:19:37,005 --> 00:19:38,794
Will believe it soon

285
00:19:38,795 --> 00:19:39,702

286
00:19:44,961 --> 00:19:45,945
All right

Can you talk first

289
00:19:54,169 --> 00:19:59,079
Why voluntarily asked for an interview

290
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:04,292
I want to warn everyone

291
00:20:04,793 --> 00:20:08,792
I will commit three more murders later

292
00:20:08,793 --> 00:20:10,499
The first is

293
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,122
Two days later, two o'clock in the afternoon the day after tomorrow

I'm going to kill director Kim Min Seok of Seungri Pharmaceutical

299
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:36,630
The way to stop the killing is simple

300
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:41,373
I ask Chairman Bian Shengil to face reporter Lin Jinxi alone

301
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:46,039
Just make a very sincere apology

302
00:20:46,832 --> 00:20:49,203
Other methods of apologizing are useless

303
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,918
Chairman Bian Seung-il must apologize

304
00:20:52,706 --> 00:20:58,040
After reporter Lin judges whether the apology is sincere

305
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,622

Why did you contact me

337
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:54,231

I want Chairman Bian Seung-il to apologize

341
00:24:38,896 --> 00:24:40,395

Bian Shengri, I will kill them all

345
00:24:50,146 --> 00:24:52,685
Put down the knife, put down

346
00:24:52,686 --> 00:24:53,892
Put the knife down

347
00:24:53,924 --> 00:24:54,994
Hurry up and put the knife down

348
00:25:07,004 --> 00:25:10,813
Um... the president received the report of this incident, right?

349
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,175
Everyone knows that the chairman is recuperating in the villa because of high blood sugar

350
00:25:16,311 --> 00:25:18,057
This matter is not yet clear

351
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,517
No need to report to him

352
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,968
What else to say about the incident, Executive Bian

353
00:25:22,143 --> 00:25:23,974
As the madman said

354
00:25:23,975 --> 00:25:27,476
If the president doesn’t apologize, it’s me

355

Mr. Lee Sangren, tell me

356

You should know the best

361
00:25:46,264 --> 00:25:46,943
Executive Bian

362
00:25:48,266 --> 00:25:50,525
That madman Park Yongho

363
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:53,138
He used to be a researcher at our institute...

364
00:25:53,139 --> 00:25:55,324
You shut up, Director Kim

365
00:26:02,638 --> 00:26:04,802
Shareholders are worried about whether it is unlucky

366
00:26:04,803 --> 00:26:06,969
Calling one after another early in the morning

367
00:26:07,848 --> 00:26:11,705
We have decided to remove that video from the Internet

368
00:26:13,317 --> 00:26:16,063
Sure enough, Executive Bian did everything neatly and neatly

369
00:26:16,477 --> 00:26:18,927
But you are still a director

370
00:26:18,928 --> 00:26:20,095
Just because of the threat of a madman

371
00:26:20,096 --> 00:26:22,912
Offer to apologize to the chairman

372
00:26:23,762 --> 00:26:25,844
Do you have no guilt for the president?

373
00:26:25,845 --> 00:26:26,887
what?

374
00:26:27,812 --> 00:26:30,386
I have been assisting the chairman for almost 30 years

375
00:26:30,387 --> 00:26:33,136
How long did you say when you came to the company

376
00:26:33,137 --> 00:26:34,805
Feeling guilty to the chairman

377
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,080
Don't talk about it

378
00:26:44,268 --> 00:26:45,252
Got it

379
00:26:45,677 --> 00:26:46,694
Yes

380
00:26:47,009 --> 00:26:49,009
The police are paying attention to this case

381
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:52,426
In addition, the company will also send guards to Director Kim

382
00:26:52,427 --> 00:26:55,258
Come on, that's all for today's meeting

383
00:26:55,259 --> 00:26:56,201
Ok

384
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,715
Director Kim is really...

385
00:27:02,006 --> 00:27:05,409
It's okay, go take a rest

386
00:27:15,797 --> 00:27:16,953
Executive Bian Meiying

387
00:27:16,953 --> 00:27:17,953
Inauguration Ceremony of Shengri Pharmaceutical

388
00:27:18,049 --> 00:27:20,089
I just said, I feel familiar

389
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:22,132
The female leader who changed the world

390
00:27:22,133 --> 00:27:24,086
The next president of Katsuhichi Pharmaceutical, right?

391
00:27:26,214 --> 00:27:28,795
Is there that kind of nonsense?

392
00:27:28,796 --> 00:27:31,548
Mr. Lee is still here

393
00:27:32,213 --> 00:27:33,519
Have you watched the show videos?

394
00:27:34,006 --> 00:27:34,027
The late Park Yongho claimed to be an employee of your company

395
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,547
(Lee Shangren, Specialist)

396
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,288
Yes, he is the leader of our company’s new drug R&amp;D team

397
00:27:41,006 --> 00:27:41,941
I learned later

398
00:27:42,379 --> 00:27:45,128
He suddenly disappeared without doing the project handover

399
00:27:45,129 --> 00:27:46,680
Leave the company in a short-term chaos

400
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,680
(Bian Meiying)

401
00:27:47,714 --> 00:27:51,377
Park Yongho’s family reported that he was missing two months ago

402
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:54,793
That he didn't go home the next day after he was on the night shift

403
00:27:54,794 --> 00:27:57,045
Can you confirm the monitoring of the day?

404
00:27:57,046 --> 00:27:59,708
How to put it, that's a bit difficult

405
00:28:00,296 --> 00:28:04,168
The research institute is in the old building of our company, which is now abandoned

406
00:28:04,169 --> 00:28:05,007
Don't talk about that first

407
00:28:05,545 --> 00:28:08,355
I'm curious what the police think about this case now

408
00:28:09,003 --> 00:28:10,534
Manipulate the corpse

409
00:28:12,044 --> 00:28:14,041
It's simply outrageous

410
00:28:14,042 --> 00:28:15,082
Right?

411
00:28:16,003 --> 00:28:17,454
Really outrageous

412
00:28:17,918 --> 00:28:20,174
But Director Bian, what makes me really curious is

413
00:28:20,584 --> 00:28:23,419
Why did Park Yongho use this method?

414
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:26,703
Let Shengri Pharmaceutical make a public apology

415
00:28:28,001 --> 00:28:31,250
-I don't know
-We will also ask the inspection team to conduct internal investigations

416
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,498
I am also worried about my father

417
00:28:33,499 --> 00:28:36,084
There are also Mr. Lee and Director Kim here

418
00:28:36,085 --> 00:28:36,109
To me, they are all uncles

419
00:28:36,109 --> 00:28:38,370
Inauguration Ceremony of
Kyungsungri Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Wish, September 19.9 (Tuesday) SL Kyungsungri Pharmaceutical

420
00:28:46,262 --> 00:28:48,708
Anyway, I found out after investigating

421
00:28:48,709 --> 00:28:51,081
A corpse manipulated by a spell corpse

422
00:28:51,082 --> 00:28:53,450
Call it "here"

423
00:28:53,908 --> 00:28:56,598
By the way, I didn't talk about the two of you

424
00:28:56,623 --> 00:28:57,914
I am now a full professor

425
00:28:57,914 --> 00:28:57,915
Here
is Zhuo Zhengxun
, full professor of Folklore Department of Sansong University

426
00:28:57,915 --> 00:29:00,080
Congratulations, let's get started

427
00:29:00,081 --> 00:29:00,751
Good

428
00:29:01,583 --> 00:29:02,366
bring it on

429
00:29:03,123 --> 00:29:04,607
Look at Xizhai Conghua

430
00:29:05,082 --> 00:29:07,664
Here it refers to a corpse resurrected from the dead

431
00:29:07,665 --> 00:29:11,122
It is said that there is wisdom in speaking like a human

432
00:29:11,123 --> 00:29:15,579
There was a man named Han Jongyu in Goryeo, he used it as a joke

433
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,496
The black hand...

434
00:29:16,497 --> 00:29:21,619
In other words, imitate this corpse whose hands and feet have turned black and come back to life

435
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:26,537
"Here, here" I sang the soul-suppressing song like this

436
00:29:26,538 --> 00:29:29,328
That's right, Park Yongho is the same

437
00:29:29,329 --> 00:29:31,983
-The first murderer's hand...-
Black

438
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:37,408
So put it together like this

439
00:29:38,327 --> 00:29:41,994
It is certain that it is the corpse manipulated by the corpse of the spell

440
00:29:41,995 --> 00:29:45,285
Does it mean someone treats the corpse, no?

441
00:29:45,286 --> 00:29:48,326
Is this the case here?

442
00:29:48,327 --> 00:29:50,793
Yes, I checked

443
00:29:51,952 --> 00:29:56,118
There is only one country that uses this kind of tattoo

444
00:29:57,117 --> 00:29:58,103
Indonesia

445
00:30:00,203 --> 00:30:01,966
How can you be so sure?

446
00:30:04,781 --> 00:30:07,286
(First Revenge)
This is Indonesian text

447
00:30:10,783 --> 00:30:11,825
Sorry

448
00:30:11,826 --> 00:30:14,575
I have analyzed

449
00:30:14,576 --> 00:30:17,782
On the body that was killed for the first time

450
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:21,116
Written first revenge

451
00:30:21,117 --> 00:30:24,490
On the body of Park Yongho you interviewed yesterday

452
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:27,157
Write attention

453
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,868
Who would do such a thing

454
00:30:30,678 --> 00:30:32,572
Witch doctor

455
00:30:32,573 --> 00:30:37,990
In Indonesia, there exists such a spellcaster who uses black magic and is called a witch doctor.

456
00:30:37,991 --> 00:30:38,988
Not long ago

457
00:30:38,989 --> 00:30:41,072
There is a politician in Indonesia

458
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:41,073
Hot topic Indonesia pays to curse 800 million rufiyah
, a professional witch doctor , and instigates the killing of mayoral candidates

459
00:30:41,073 --> 00:30:43,613
To curse competing candidates

460
00:30:43,614 --> 00:30:47,071
The witch doctor Santer was found during the campaign, so it became a hot topic

461
00:30:47,072 --> 00:30:48,573
Have also been reported

462
00:30:48,574 --> 00:30:50,780
Come, wait a moment

463
00:30:53,572 --> 00:30:56,070
Sant the Witch Doctor

464
00:30:57,239 --> 00:31:00,571
There are many ways for witch doctors to manipulate corpses

465
00:31:00,572 --> 00:31:04,029
The first is in the soil where the corpse died

466
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:08,318
Mixed with the blood of the witch doctor who casts the spell into mud

467
00:31:09,737 --> 00:31:11,944
Build clay figurines

468
00:31:11,945 --> 00:31:16,444
Then cast a curse here

469
00:31:17,902 --> 00:31:21,818
Park Yongho's face also collapsed like mud

470
00:31:21,819 --> 00:31:22,819
Yes

471
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:25,860
Then if the caster wants the power to control the corpse

472
00:31:25,861 --> 00:31:29,193
You have to dedicate what you cherish to the ghost

473
00:31:29,194 --> 00:31:30,733
Place offerings here

474
00:31:30,734 --> 00:31:32,639
In the surrounding guard zone

475
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:36,277
Place the adulterer who wants to manipulate the corpse

476
00:31:36,278 --> 00:31:40,899
Clay figurines with hair or fingernails

477
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:44,374
Finally write down what you want to indicate

478
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,775
In this way, it will...

479
00:31:48,776 --> 00:31:50,818
Equivalent to a contract

480
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:52,066
That's right

481
00:31:52,067 --> 00:31:54,732
It’s a contract with instructions from the person who cast the spell

482
00:31:54,733 --> 00:31:57,691
If the witch doctor really does this kind of thing

483
00:31:57,692 --> 00:32:01,141
Tomorrow may use others to kill people here

484
00:32:06,752 --> 00:32:07,478
Yes

485
00:32:07,774 --> 00:32:10,148
The identity of the corpse who killed Kim Jong Kyun has been found

486
00:32:10,149 --> 00:32:12,440
Is it? who is it

487
00:32:12,441 --> 00:32:14,356
His name is Huang Zhenguo

488
00:32:14,357 --> 00:32:16,658
My family reported missing five years ago

489
00:32:16,658 --> 00:32:16,666
Huang Zhenguo’s
family reported missing five years ago.
Suspected of being a vagrant,
he joined the fake passbook organization two years ago.

490
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:21,398
About two years ago, I provided my personal information to the imposter bankbook organization

491
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:25,478
I checked this organization mainly sells the personal information of the homeless

492
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:28,770
The head of the organization is currently operating illegal casinos

493
00:32:28,771 --> 00:32:31,063
Is serving a sentence

494
00:32:31,064 --> 00:32:34,518
Then you go back to me after you meet the wanderers soliciting guests

495
00:32:34,898 --> 00:32:36,646
Okay, got it, I’ve worked hard

496
00:32:36,647 --> 00:32:37,294
Ok

497
00:33:01,727 --> 00:33:02,366
Who

498
00:33:17,433 --> 00:33:18,400
Jessie

499
00:33:20,475 --> 00:33:21,918
What are you doing alone?

500
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:26,023
Considering the shooting tomorrow, I’m looking at the equipment

501
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:28,255
All right

502
00:33:29,393 --> 00:33:33,101
-By the way, you did a great job yesterday
-what

503
00:33:33,102 --> 00:33:34,641
Yu Can said

504
00:33:34,642 --> 00:33:38,148
You finished shooting after you chased Park Yongho

505
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,200
thanks

506
00:33:42,699 --> 00:33:47,169
But is the name of that slanderous master Zhao Nai?

507
00:33:47,641 --> 00:33:48,317
what?

508
00:33:54,694 --> 00:33:55,327
right

509
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:59,221
It seems you have read my book

510
00:33:59,222 --> 00:34:01,305
Senior Woo Chan said

511
00:34:01,306 --> 00:34:05,762
You must find a slanderer to avenge you

512
00:34:05,763 --> 00:34:07,346
Books can sell well

513
00:34:07,347 --> 00:34:09,545
Not exactly

514
00:34:10,264 --> 00:34:12,113
How is that

515
00:34:12,388 --> 00:34:13,302
This one

516
00:34:15,846 --> 00:34:21,677
Because for Zhao Nai, I am equivalent to her family

517
00:34:22,173 --> 00:34:25,678
I want to tell her even in the book

518
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,822
She can come back anytime

519
00:34:33,303 --> 00:34:36,985
Jesse, who are you in your family?

520
00:34:38,052 --> 00:34:42,593
Two dads and brother

521
00:34:42,594 --> 00:34:45,510
But dad doesn’t care about us

522
00:34:45,511 --> 00:34:48,425
Obviously incompetent, but self-thinking

523
00:34:48,426 --> 00:34:50,860
Even when my mother died, she was not by her side

524
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,383
Reporter Lin, sorry

525
00:35:01,384 --> 00:35:05,299
You should be very busy, but I just said something useless

526
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,300
Where

527
00:35:06,301 --> 00:35:08,967
Are we teammates now?

528
00:35:08,968 --> 00:35:12,034
Let's talk in detail after the case is over

529
00:35:12,801 --> 00:35:13,506
Ok

530
00:35:13,507 --> 00:35:14,766
Go back soon

531
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:26,133
Our representative Huang turned out to be operating a private casino

532
00:35:26,134 --> 00:35:28,173
Was sentenced to four years in prison

533
00:35:28,198 --> 00:35:29,788
But it’s too long, right?

534
00:35:31,857 --> 00:35:33,213
Who do you say you are?

535
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,590
Although I am a detective now

536
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:38,131
But before that, I worked as a detective for 20 years

537
00:35:38,132 --> 00:35:41,172
All my juniors are department heads and group leaders

538
00:35:41,173 --> 00:35:43,463
As long as you answer my question well

539
00:35:43,464 --> 00:35:47,672
I can also reduce your sentence

540
00:35:48,257 --> 00:35:50,462
If you don't like it, then forget it

541
00:36:03,254 --> 00:36:04,420
What do you want to know?

542
00:36:04,421 --> 00:36:06,069
Do you know about the Shengil Pharmaceutical case?

543
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:10,753
You must have heard of the big reports on TV

544
00:36:10,754 --> 00:36:14,212
But the perpetrator of the first homicide

545
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:16,351
It's actually a corpse that has been dead for three months

546
00:36:17,337 --> 00:36:19,794
And when the corpse was still alive

547
00:36:19,795 --> 00:36:22,835
I'm a wanderer who sold you personal information

548
00:36:22,836 --> 00:36:25,251
So, what's wrong?

549
00:36:25,961 --> 00:36:28,792
What did Shengri Pharmaceutical let you do?

550
00:36:50,874 --> 00:36:51,833
Once in a national media

551
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:54,499
In the interview, the time to predict the killing was approaching

552
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,049
Here and now, Shengri Pharmaceutical Headquarters looks tense

553
00:36:56,049 --> 00:36:57,046
Police Special Attack Corps

554
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:01,373
The police regarded the announced killing as a terrorist attack

555
00:37:01,374 --> 00:37:05,082
Therefore, the police special forces of the two teams are arranged inside and outside of Katsuhichi Pharmaceutical

556
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:07,540
just in case

557
00:37:07,541 --> 00:37:10,038
Turn off the camera for a while before recording

558
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:11,998
senior

559
00:37:12,956 --> 00:37:13,679
is it going well?

560
00:37:14,414 --> 00:37:16,246
I miss you

561
00:37:16,247 --> 00:37:19,871
If seniors have good news, share them together

562
00:37:19,872 --> 00:37:21,116
I don't know anything

563
00:37:21,498 --> 00:37:25,537
Whoops, you should understand that even if you start your own business, you shouldn’t antagonize our mainstream media.

564
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:29,161
In the past, we could not do anything because of our competitors

565
00:37:29,162 --> 00:37:31,580
We and Zhongzhen Daily are competitors

566
00:37:31,581 --> 00:37:32,120
senior

567
00:37:32,121 --> 00:37:33,329
The person you interviewed last time

568
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:35,038
Do you really don't know each other in private?

569
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:35,994
Give me a message

570
00:37:35,995 --> 00:37:38,953
Where did so many flies come from

571
00:37:38,954 --> 00:37:39,645
Ouch

572
00:37:40,162 --> 00:37:43,745
They used to talk behind your back that you are a fake reporter

573
00:37:43,746 --> 00:37:45,410
Now it's another friendship

574
00:37:45,411 --> 00:37:47,537
Forget it, this is the way this circle is, and it’s not a day or two.

575
00:37:47,538 --> 00:37:48,143
- is not it
- and

576
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,054
Nothing special for now, right?

577
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:50,603
Yes

578
00:37:50,871 --> 00:37:54,161
But so many people gather and the police are ready

579
00:37:54,162 --> 00:37:55,525
Do you say something will happen?

580
00:37:57,268 --> 00:37:58,265
Wait and see

581
00:37:59,994 --> 00:38:00,869
Where's Jesse?

582
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:02,889
I told her to buy coffee

583
00:38:03,495 --> 00:38:05,909
It takes a long time to ask her to do something

584
00:38:05,934 --> 00:38:08,336
Anyway, not clever at all, damn it

585
00:38:09,202 --> 00:38:11,117
You were not clever at all before

586
00:38:11,118 --> 00:38:14,574
Senior, why did you mention the previous thing again?

587
00:38:14,575 --> 00:38:17,035
Be nice to her, she is serious in doing things

588
00:38:17,036 --> 00:38:17,712
Yes

589
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,698
Chief, why are you here?

590
00:38:38,699 --> 00:38:40,688
Come and have a look before going to the meeting

591
00:38:41,342 --> 00:38:44,154
Because we want to appease our seniors

592
00:38:45,574 --> 00:38:47,656
Have some coffee

593
00:38:47,657 --> 00:38:50,531
Our police will protect everyone

594
00:38:50,532 --> 00:38:51,795
Don't worry too much

595
00:38:52,745 --> 00:38:53,729
Yes thanks

596
00:38:55,988 --> 00:38:58,948
Chief, you have also seen that monster

597
00:38:58,949 --> 00:39:01,270
Looks exactly like ordinary people

598
00:39:02,074 --> 00:39:04,279
The police have a way to stop it

599
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,404
It's okay, isn't the special attack team coming too?

600
00:39:07,405 --> 00:39:08,239
Just

601
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:12,069
I told the special forces, don’t worry

602
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,750
About six months ago

603
00:39:14,489 --> 00:39:18,154
Shengri Pharmaceutical wants to conduct new research and development drug trials

604
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:21,530
Secretly recruited people for clinical trials

605
00:39:21,531 --> 00:39:23,599
That's a lucrative job

606
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:26,111
Say you can divide my 30% of the agency fee

607
00:39:26,112 --> 00:39:28,242
But there may be something shameful

608
00:39:28,921 --> 00:39:31,433
Tell me to recruit only vagrants who have no relatives

609
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:34,355
But there are not enough homeless people who meet the requirements

610
00:39:34,985 --> 00:39:37,444
So, I used illegal stayers to make up the rest

611
00:39:37,445 --> 00:39:38,645
Illegal stayer

612
00:39:41,652 --> 00:39:43,666
Stop, the idlers and others can't come near here

613
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,819
Sir, I said you can’t go near here

614
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:51,817
Occurrence situation

615
00:39:53,361 --> 00:39:55,567
I'm about to grab it, leg

616
00:39:55,568 --> 00:39:57,151
Come on

617
00:39:57,152 --> 00:39:58,983
Attacked by unarmed personnel

618
00:39:58,984 --> 00:40:00,732
What did you say?

619
00:40:00,733 --> 00:40:03,067
Go back door support

620
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:05,274
Go to the back door right away

621
00:40:05,275 --> 00:40:06,275
Second Squadron heads to the back door

622
00:40:06,276 --> 00:40:07,554
I don't know what the test is

623
00:40:08,398 --> 00:40:10,761
All those people died within a few months

624
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,791
How many people did you introduce?

625
00:40:17,365 --> 00:40:18,139
that

626
00:40:19,764 --> 00:40:21,603
How many people are coming

627
00:40:23,564 --> 00:40:25,941
Please go back and not go any further

628
00:40:25,942 --> 00:40:27,897
Please don't take pictures

629
00:40:27,898 --> 00:40:29,273
Everyone can't do this

630
00:40:29,274 --> 00:40:31,523
Please don't take pictures

631
00:40:44,173 --> 00:40:44,798
One

632
00:40:44,823 --> 00:40:45,770
Two

633
00:40:47,076 --> 00:40:48,075
Three

634
00:40:48,622 --> 00:40:49,299
Four

635
00:40:50,158 --> 00:40:51,158
Five

636
00:40:52,062 --> 00:40:53,062
Six

637
00:40:53,813 --> 00:40:54,828
Seven

638
00:40:55,513 --> 00:40:56,513
Eight

639
00:40:56,771 --> 00:40:57,770
Nine

640
00:40:58,674 --> 00:40:59,674
Ten

641
00:40:59,729 --> 00:41:00,931
Ten people?

642
00:41:02,204 --> 00:41:03,459
Is not

643
00:41:03,687 --> 00:41:07,012
Ten people in each group, a total of ten groups

644
00:41:10,813 --> 00:41:12,519
A hundred people

645
00:41:16,436 --> 00:41:17,820
A hundred people

646
00:41:23,686 --> 00:41:24,683
(Katsuri Pharmaceutical)

647
00:41:31,476 --> 00:41:32,767
Uyan

648
00:41:32,768 --> 00:41:33,476
Yes senior

649
00:41:33,477 --> 00:41:35,391
Whoa, who are those?

650
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:38,016
-What's the situation
-Snapshot

651
00:41:38,017 --> 00:41:40,101
Take defensive measures

652
00:41:40,102 --> 00:41:40,966
Fast, fast

653
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:02,432
Reporter Zhang

654
00:42:08,224 --> 00:42:11,180
They broke through the defensive line, the defensive line

655
00:42:17,931 --> 00:42:20,888
They are monsters

656
00:42:20,889 --> 00:42:22,804
Kill them, kill them

657
00:42:22,805 --> 00:42:24,262
Well, they are ordinary people who are unarmed

658
00:42:24,263 --> 00:42:26,575
What are you doing, shooting them to death?

659
00:42:38,511 --> 00:42:41,096
We have already positioned it, group leader

660
00:42:41,121 --> 00:42:42,141
Please advise

661
00:42:43,274 --> 00:42:44,702
Do you want to shoot, group leader?

662
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:46,949
Hit them in the leg

663
00:43:01,176 --> 00:43:04,800
Team leader, they can still get up again after being shot

664
00:43:10,219 --> 00:43:11,341
They rushed up the stairs

665
00:43:11,342 --> 00:43:14,424
Block the stairs, block the stairs

666
00:43:26,718 --> 00:43:29,432
We have to transfer before they come up

667
00:43:32,717 --> 00:43:35,340
Min Seok, hurry up, hurry up

668
00:43:36,258 --> 00:43:37,672
Turn off the light source and lead the way

669
00:43:37,673 --> 00:43:39,007
Go to the underground garage

670
00:43:39,031 --> 00:43:39,919
Yes, understand

671
00:43:58,548 --> 00:43:59,627
shot

672
00:44:10,838 --> 00:44:12,420
Turn left there and go straight

673
00:44:14,857 --> 00:44:18,088
Go forward there, then turn left and you will see the backup elevator

674
00:44:18,089 --> 00:44:19,711
Ok, now start the elevator

675
00:44:19,712 --> 00:44:21,754
You have to leave as soon as possible

676
00:45:48,039 --> 00:45:50,536
-Woo Chan, follow me.
-What?

677
00:45:50,537 --> 00:45:52,038
Senior, where are you going

678
00:46:10,119 --> 00:46:11,992
Chengjun, how are you?

679
00:46:11,993 --> 00:46:12,918
Jin Hee

680
00:46:18,284 --> 00:46:19,576
Jinxi, hide

681
00:46:19,577 --> 00:46:20,827
Go

682
00:46:20,828 --> 00:46:21,624
Sit firmly

683
00:46:22,476 --> 00:46:23,011
Sit firmly

684
00:46:23,035 --> 00:46:23,943
Senior, wait, wait, wait

685
00:46:32,534 --> 00:46:33,910
Section Chief

686
00:46:44,157 --> 00:46:45,233
Go to the police station

687
00:47:01,324 --> 00:47:02,489
Hello

688
00:47:03,322 --> 00:47:04,353
What's up

689
00:47:05,783 --> 00:47:07,946
What are you doing, what are you doing

690
00:47:09,074 --> 00:47:11,113
Stop for me, that's my car

691
00:47:18,323 --> 00:47:23,320
My children and wife are studying abroad now

692
00:47:23,321 --> 00:47:24,878
I miss the kids

693
00:47:37,446 --> 00:47:38,112
senior

694
00:47:38,137 --> 00:47:39,471
Now the number of hits has reached 170,000, 170,000

695
00:47:55,902 --> 00:47:58,275
It’s them, taking those taxis

696
00:47:58,276 --> 00:47:59,068
Yes

697
00:48:16,716 --> 00:48:17,361
Turn left

698
00:50:15,265 --> 00:50:17,238
Over there

699
00:51:13,385 --> 00:51:15,372
Brake, brake, brake

700
00:51:21,550 --> 00:51:22,675
Continue to shoot

701
00:51:22,676 --> 00:51:23,518
Ok

702
00:51:51,758 --> 00:51:52,163
Help

703
00:51:57,131 --> 00:51:59,673
Don't don't

704
00:52:01,965 --> 00:52:03,207
No

705
00:52:04,922 --> 00:52:08,297
Don't don't

706
00:52:08,298 --> 00:52:11,671
Help

707
00:53:56,954 --> 00:53:58,329
Naritoshi

708
00:54:00,747 --> 00:54:01,973
Naritoshi

709
00:54:06,383 --> 00:54:07,437
Naritoshi

710
00:54:08,937 --> 00:54:09,598
Naritoshi

711
00:54:11,913 --> 00:54:13,119
Wake up

712
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,149
Chengjun, don't

713
00:54:14,996 --> 00:54:16,258
ambulance

714
00:54:41,341 --> 00:54:42,091
Hello, you...

715
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:45,830
sorry

716
00:54:46,035 --> 00:54:47,034
Where did you just go?

717
00:54:47,035 --> 00:54:48,824
How not to answer the phone?

718
00:54:48,825 --> 00:54:49,658
Really worrying

719
00:54:49,659 --> 00:54:51,741
Where are you going, you have to tell me before you go

720
00:54:51,742 --> 00:54:53,399
Do you know what happened there just now?

721
00:54:55,529 --> 00:54:56,529
(Access control area)

722
00:54:57,076 --> 00:54:59,189
Forget it, what can you understand

723
00:55:08,949 --> 00:55:11,614
A paralytic shellfish toxin called PSP that comes into contact with the skin

724
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:14,113
Now it spreads quickly to the whole body

725
00:55:14,114 --> 00:55:17,155
The strange thing is that all patients are acute

726
00:55:17,156 --> 00:55:20,070
So far, no treatment has worked

727
00:55:20,071 --> 00:55:22,698
Although we are also panicked

728
00:55:22,699 --> 00:55:24,380
But we will do our best

729
00:55:29,282 --> 00:55:31,301
Why stand there, sit here

730
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:36,114
This wine is a free vaccine we provide

731
00:55:36,115 --> 00:55:37,981
Wine from the Prime Minister of South Africa

732
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:42,142
President

733
00:55:43,795 --> 00:55:45,146
Director Kim is dead

734
00:55:45,853 --> 00:55:46,814
I know

735
00:55:47,904 --> 00:55:49,561
I also saw the news

736
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:52,359
Director of the Institute, Kim Jong-kyun

737
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:53,573
And the cause of Min Seok's death

738
00:56:00,248 --> 00:56:01,467
Okay, okay

739
00:56:01,514 --> 00:56:03,151
It's okay, just tell me

740
00:56:10,102 --> 00:56:13,401
Brother, the cause of death of two people

741
00:56:13,402 --> 00:56:15,570
I heard that the death was caused by PSP

742
00:56:15,776 --> 00:56:18,399
This must be related to this clinical trial

743
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,276
That was done because of need

744
00:56:20,277 --> 00:56:21,152
Please apologize

745
00:56:22,276 --> 00:56:22,983
Who do you apologize to?

746
00:56:22,984 --> 00:56:23,859
Who else

747
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:26,528
Of course it’s for people participating in clinical trials

748
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:33,131
Are dead, let me apologize to the dead body

749
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:37,221
No, do you really want to apologize?

750
00:56:37,252 --> 00:56:40,358
Hey, if it's my personal business, I will apologize

751
00:56:40,359 --> 00:56:42,982
But I’m the general manager of a company

752
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:44,605
This is a company business, Shangren

753
00:56:44,606 --> 00:56:45,445
Big brother

754
00:57:00,647 --> 00:57:04,103
I will discuss it with my home

755
00:57:04,439 --> 00:57:05,454
What did you say?

756
00:57:06,315 --> 00:57:10,127
Do you want to discuss with your daughter about apologizing?

757
00:57:10,312 --> 00:57:13,504
Shangren, our time is over

758
00:57:13,896 --> 00:57:17,000
Now it’s time to nominate someone to lead the company

759
00:57:21,541 --> 00:57:23,069
I'm leaving now, chairman

760
00:57:26,894 --> 00:57:27,932
Shangren

761
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:30,695
Shangren

762
00:57:33,145 --> 00:57:35,300
Uncle, why are you leaving so soon?

763
00:57:41,812 --> 00:57:44,849
You see how thin your face is, it really makes me sad

764
00:57:45,362 --> 00:57:47,783
Yeah, why did you follow Director Kim?

765
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:51,592
It's raining hard outside, take this umbrella

766
00:57:56,101 --> 00:57:57,999
You are leading the clinical trial, right?

767
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:01,065
What do you mean

768
00:58:01,725 --> 00:58:04,184
Didn't Dad already get your autographs?

769
00:58:04,185 --> 00:58:07,548
Until now, we have been making medicine to save people

770
00:58:08,683 --> 00:58:13,283
But didn't you force the clinical trial for the money?

771
00:58:13,726 --> 00:58:15,640
Don't you have any responsibility?

772
00:58:15,641 --> 00:58:16,562
Uncle

773
00:58:18,192 --> 00:58:20,238
I'm all for the company

774
00:58:21,265 --> 00:58:23,099
A person who has dedicated his life for the company

775
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:24,951
Then you should always try your best

776
00:58:25,307 --> 00:58:28,431
This is not your dad and my dream

777
00:58:28,432 --> 00:58:29,924
We do our best...

778
00:58:30,702 --> 00:58:31,624
Really

779
00:58:34,764 --> 00:58:37,211
Why do you have a dream in my company?

780
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:39,347
What did you say?

781
00:58:39,348 --> 00:58:41,722
Say that kind of cowardly words

782
00:58:41,723 --> 00:58:44,151
Murderers look down on us

783
00:58:45,389 --> 00:58:47,690
Anyway, I know how to make excuses when I'm old

784
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:55,788
That is to say, you will be the one who will lead us to Katsuhichi Pharmaceutical from now on, right?

785
00:58:57,504 --> 00:58:58,276
Good

786
00:59:00,804 --> 00:59:01,725
Uncle

787
00:59:02,597 --> 00:59:04,854
I will work out a plan with the strategy team

788
00:59:12,261 --> 00:59:13,070
Really

789
00:59:21,804 --> 00:59:25,967
The reason why the attack on Katsuhichi Pharmaceutical is unnatural here

790
00:59:25,968 --> 00:59:29,718
It might be because you manipulated too many corpses at once

791
00:59:29,719 --> 00:59:32,967
And the pattern of the spell

792
00:59:32,968 --> 00:59:34,176
The one on the wrist

793
00:59:34,177 --> 00:59:36,426
I saw that after the shot was shot at that location

794
00:59:36,427 --> 00:59:38,645
Someone can't move

795
00:59:42,634 --> 00:59:45,716
So say witch doctors and those who are here

796
00:59:45,717 --> 00:59:47,100
Is it connected by that tattoo?

797
00:59:48,008 --> 00:59:51,047
Professor, the leader of Zheng

798
00:59:51,048 --> 00:59:51,881
What do you think?

799
00:59:51,882 --> 00:59:53,984
Didn't the hospital also say that there is no way to save him?

800
00:59:54,298 --> 00:59:58,696
Not because of poison, but because of being cursed

801
00:59:59,466 --> 01:00:01,169
What about the solution?

802
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:03,882
It must be lifted by the person who casts the curse himself

803
01:00:03,883 --> 01:00:04,505
Otherwise...

804
01:00:04,506 --> 01:00:08,839
Or kill the cursed person

805
01:00:10,828 --> 01:00:12,164
correct

806
01:00:19,549 --> 01:00:22,880
Anyway, thank you. If you have any questions, I will contact your professor.

807
01:00:22,881 --> 01:00:24,831
Anytime, it’s hard work

808
01:00:35,435 --> 01:00:36,814
Ok let's sort it out

809
01:00:37,129 --> 01:00:41,503
Shengri Pharmaceutical recruited one hundred homeless people to participate in clinical trials

810
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:43,669
Because nothing will be a problem in the future

811
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:46,190
However, there are not so many qualified Wanderers

812
01:00:47,004 --> 01:00:48,920
So even those who have stayed illegally used it

813
01:00:48,921 --> 01:00:51,878
So are there any people from Indonesia?

814
01:00:51,879 --> 01:00:52,629
Yeah

815
01:00:52,934 --> 01:00:56,960
In short, all clinical trial participants died due to side effects

816
01:00:56,961 --> 01:00:59,626
And the one who manages those hundred corpses

817
01:00:59,627 --> 01:01:03,001
This is the Park Yongho interviewed by reporter Lin

818
01:01:03,002 --> 01:01:06,122
At the time of the interview, wasn't it a corpse that had been dead for two months?

819
01:01:07,252 --> 01:01:10,147
The Xuan Zhemin I saw told me this

820
01:01:10,897 --> 01:01:12,917
All died just like that

821
01:01:12,918 --> 01:01:17,167
Then it seems that a month or so has passed

822
01:01:17,168 --> 01:01:20,542
A man from Southeast Asia came to our office

823
01:01:20,543 --> 01:01:21,915
Southeast Asia?

824
01:01:21,916 --> 01:01:25,499
Said that my family is doing part-time jobs in this company

825
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:28,039
I wrote myself a letter that can make a lot of money

826
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:29,624
Lost contact afterwards

827
01:01:29,625 --> 01:01:30,834
Who is that person's family?

828
01:01:30,835 --> 01:01:32,290
I don't know

829
01:01:32,291 --> 01:01:35,164
Is the one who was in charge of the show

830
01:01:35,165 --> 01:01:35,748
Park Yongho

831
01:01:35,749 --> 01:01:39,331
Yes, Park Yongho, I told him his contact information

832
01:01:39,332 --> 01:01:42,999
Tell him because I don’t understand well, so I went to that person

833
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,605
Do you remember what that person looks like?

834
01:01:51,763 --> 01:01:55,532
Dressed like a Taoist priest

835
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:58,965
A bit weird anyway

836
01:02:02,164 --> 01:02:03,473
Witch doctor

837
01:02:04,163 --> 01:02:06,619
Later, Park Yongho disappeared

838
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:10,245
However, a hundred corpses also disappeared

839
01:02:10,246 --> 01:02:12,162
So the witch doctor killed Park Yongho

840
01:02:12,163 --> 01:02:14,036
Let him become one here

841
01:02:14,037 --> 01:02:14,870
Then manipulate that guy

842
01:02:14,871 --> 01:02:16,327
Transport the body to somewhere

843
01:02:16,328 --> 01:02:19,408
Then I made a hundred more here, right?

844
01:02:20,161 --> 01:02:24,036
No, there is no way to know the identity of the witch doctor

845
01:02:24,037 --> 01:02:25,495
Want to find out the identity of this witch doctor?

846
01:02:25,496 --> 01:02:27,285
We need a list of test personnel

847
01:02:27,286 --> 01:02:29,466
Only then can we know who his family members are

848
01:02:29,828 --> 01:02:32,409
How to steal the list from Katsuhichi Pharmaceutical?

849
01:02:32,410 --> 01:02:34,411
Prepare the camera, we are going to interview

850
01:02:34,412 --> 01:02:36,313
Now? What kind of interview?

851
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:43,196
(Urban detective, we will become the mouths of powerless people)

852
01:02:45,575 --> 01:02:49,486
This time the project is from the US SFD side

853
01:02:49,994 --> 01:02:53,075
From the proposal of the development and production of shellfish toxins

854
01:02:53,076 --> 01:02:55,992
Starting from the raw materials of chemical weapons

855
01:02:55,993 --> 01:03:02,003
So we recruited homeless and illegal stayers and conducted clinical trials

856
01:03:02,575 --> 01:03:04,781
I don't think there will be any problems in the law

857
01:03:04,782 --> 01:03:08,615
Not that there will be no problems, but that they will not cause problems

858
01:03:08,616 --> 01:03:11,923
Because they are poor, because they are weak

859
01:03:15,324 --> 01:03:16,908
It seems like that

860
01:03:18,824 --> 01:03:21,207
The person the murderer wanted to kill

861
01:03:21,657 --> 01:03:26,059
They are all people who finally agreed to the clinical trial and stamped it

862
01:03:27,059 --> 01:03:29,180
Among the people participating in this clinical trial

863
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:31,114
Person in charge: Kim Jong-kyun Director: Kim Min-seok
Executive Director: Lee Sang-in Representative Director: Byun Seung-il

864
01:03:31,114 --> 01:03:32,700
Are there Indonesians too?

865
01:03:32,973 --> 01:03:35,033
I am not sure about the specific content

866
01:03:35,781 --> 01:03:37,445
But in the information I brought

867
01:03:37,446 --> 01:03:40,153
Participants’ volunteers and related documents

868
01:03:40,154 --> 01:03:41,556
Please confirm

869
01:03:44,787 --> 01:03:48,103
The interview you are doing now will also serve as evidence for the police

870
01:03:50,988 --> 01:03:52,779
Specialist, you knew it from the beginning, right

871
01:03:57,155 --> 01:04:02,026
This clinical trial is illegal

872
01:04:06,152 --> 01:04:09,526
Clinical trials may have side effects at any time

873
01:04:09,527 --> 01:04:11,194
And at the sacrifice of a few people

874
01:04:11,195 --> 01:04:13,151
Will save many people

875
01:04:13,152 --> 01:04:15,194
What is this clinical trial?

876
01:04:15,195 --> 01:04:18,224
With a few sacrifices, make medicine that can kill hundreds of thousands of people

877
01:04:18,326 --> 01:04:19,643
Is it this way

878
01:04:19,870 --> 01:04:22,033
I already apologized to you just now

879
01:04:22,693 --> 01:04:25,316
Yes, I will be responsible in my own way

880
01:04:25,317 --> 01:04:26,776
What about President Bian Seung-il?

881
01:04:26,777 --> 01:04:28,610
Is he going to apologize?

882
01:04:29,317 --> 01:04:30,493
Are we President Bian?

883
01:04:33,318 --> 01:04:36,627
That person he will never apologize

884
01:04:38,608 --> 01:04:40,216
He is that kind of person

885
01:04:41,838 --> 01:04:45,257
Because of your company, innocent people died

886
01:04:45,608 --> 01:04:47,795
To protect you like that

887
01:04:48,774 --> 01:04:51,896
Many policemen were injured today and are slowly dying

888
01:04:56,798 --> 01:04:59,061
I heard that your husband is in the hospital

889
01:05:01,652 --> 01:05:02,785
Really sorry

890
01:05:18,147 --> 01:05:20,478
Although there is a list of test personnel

891
01:05:20,479 --> 01:05:22,105
But the information is not credible

892
01:05:22,773 --> 01:05:25,401
Can I know who the witch doctor’s family is through this?

893
01:05:26,812 --> 01:05:29,547
Go to the illegal detention management station, you should compare them one by one

894
01:05:30,396 --> 01:05:32,957
No, where is he?

895
01:05:34,446 --> 01:05:36,181
Although I don't know where

896
01:05:36,561 --> 01:05:38,442
But I should be with you here

897
01:05:41,104 --> 01:05:44,019
Where the cursed corpse died...

898
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:46,851
…Mix your own blood to create clay figurines

899
01:05:46,852 --> 01:05:48,144
The soil where the body died

900
01:05:48,145 --> 01:05:51,686
Where the body died

901
01:05:51,687 --> 01:05:53,024
Soil

902
01:05:53,894 --> 01:05:55,725
Professor Zhuo said that the method of manufacturing here is

903
01:05:55,726 --> 01:05:57,351
The soil where they died

904
01:05:57,352 --> 01:06:00,059
Mix with the blood of the caster to make a clay figurine

905
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:01,560
Yes, that's what it said

906
01:06:01,561 --> 01:06:04,559
Isn’t that the place where the clinical trial personnel died?

907
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:05,391
That institute is

908
01:06:05,392 --> 01:06:07,434
It used to be temporarily built in the Shengri Pharmaceutical Building

909
01:06:07,435 --> 01:06:09,401
Could it be that it is here?

910
01:06:10,825 --> 01:06:13,517
Shengri Pharmaceutical Ninth Street, yes, this is the address

911
01:06:13,518 --> 01:06:16,724
There may be witch doctors there

912
01:06:16,725 --> 01:06:18,059
I will go there to see

913
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:21,184
OK, then I’ll go find out who his family is

914
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:22,599
Sister-in-law, let me go with you

915
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,558
I also sent the address to Professor Zhuo

916
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:26,766
Representative, are you going to the Illegal Stay Management Office?

917
01:06:26,767 --> 01:06:27,392
Yeah

918
01:06:27,393 --> 01:06:28,682
Long Xiu, let's go with the representative

919
01:06:28,683 --> 01:06:29,307
Ok

920
01:06:29,308 --> 01:06:30,208
hurry up

921
01:07:23,094 --> 01:07:24,537
all these are…

922
01:07:37,636 --> 01:07:39,550
Seems to be coming soon

923
01:07:39,551 --> 01:07:40,717
right here

924
01:07:40,757 --> 01:07:41,546
parking

925
01:08:27,922 --> 01:08:28,742
Are you alright?

926
01:09:26,042 --> 01:09:27,042
what is this?

927
01:10:02,957 --> 01:10:05,455
Sister-in-law, wait for Professor Zhuo to come here and ask him again

928
01:10:05,456 --> 01:10:06,925
Let's go up first

929
01:11:09,492 --> 01:11:10,169
Sister-in-law

930
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:14,382
Here

931
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:19,945
Run fast

932
01:11:29,157 --> 01:11:29,969
Are you alright?

933
01:11:31,034 --> 01:11:31,833
I'm fine

934
01:11:32,074 --> 01:11:32,855
Go here

935
01:13:06,573 --> 01:13:07,418
Zhao Na

936
01:13:07,442 --> 01:13:09,681
Sister, let's leave soon

937
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:11,546
Officer Liu

938
01:14:14,852 --> 01:14:15,469
Sister

939
01:14:16,434 --> 01:14:17,388
Come here soon

940
01:14:18,888 --> 01:14:19,752
You go first

941
01:14:28,724 --> 01:14:30,475
Officer Liu

942
01:14:30,476 --> 01:14:32,849
Officer Liu, hurry up, hurry up

943
01:14:32,850 --> 01:14:33,891
Come here

944
01:14:33,892 --> 01:14:35,365
Can't go now

945
01:15:29,513 --> 01:15:31,267
The right wrist is their weakness

946
01:16:48,365 --> 01:16:49,090
Sister

947
01:16:52,631 --> 01:16:56,193
Well come, Zhao Nai

948
01:16:56,865 --> 01:16:58,307
Well come

949
01:17:11,253 --> 01:17:15,514
I've been to the places that can stop the evil spirits from me

950
01:17:16,254 --> 01:17:18,324
Stay in Japan for about a year and a half

951
01:17:36,876 --> 01:17:39,238
And then went to a Chinese temple

952
01:17:48,172 --> 01:17:50,951
Although I didn’t find a way to stop the evil spirits

953
01:17:52,207 --> 01:17:53,510
But I learned a lot to use my own body

954
01:17:55,084 --> 01:17:58,049
Alchemy with evil spirits

955
01:18:17,997 --> 01:18:20,264
Try to stay there like that

956
01:18:20,834 --> 01:18:22,894
Intend to avoid people's lives

957
01:18:26,790 --> 01:18:28,708
But when connected to my sister’s dream

958
01:18:29,865 --> 01:18:32,127
Obviously feel what happened to you

959
01:18:43,091 --> 01:18:44,088
Zhao Na

960
01:18:46,038 --> 01:18:50,063
Never go anywhere else

961
01:18:53,121 --> 01:18:54,231
Definitely don't go

962
01:18:56,936 --> 01:18:57,693
That, sister-in-law

963
01:18:59,287 --> 01:19:03,030
Mr. Lee Sang-in, he committed suicide

964
01:19:03,952 --> 01:19:04,654
What?

965
01:19:07,118 --> 01:19:08,329
Yes i am

966
01:19:08,620 --> 01:19:10,427
Ok yes

967
01:19:29,158 --> 01:19:31,364
If you want to die, you will die in your own home

968
01:19:34,242 --> 01:19:36,124
Dad, it's me

969
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:42,919
Uyan

970
01:19:43,074 --> 01:19:45,780
Senpai, I just contacted Shengri Pharmaceutical

971
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:48,074
Chairman Bian Seung Il wants to do an interview with an apology

972
01:19:48,075 --> 01:19:49,116
Exclusive to you

973
01:19:49,740 --> 01:19:50,656
What did you say?

974
01:19:50,657 --> 01:19:52,322
Director Lee Sang-in has also become like this

975
01:19:52,323 --> 01:19:54,648
He thinks it's his turn now, so he wants to apologize?

976
01:19:56,115 --> 01:19:58,613
Yucan, you are ready to interview now

977
01:19:58,614 --> 01:20:00,020
Go to Shengri Pharmaceutical and wait for me

978
01:20:00,157 --> 01:20:01,329
I'll go there right away

979
01:20:01,488 --> 01:20:02,493
Ok

980
01:20:05,155 --> 01:20:07,778
Just wait for Professor Zhuo to come and end the investigation here

981
01:20:07,779 --> 01:20:08,966
Ok i got it

982
01:20:09,363 --> 01:20:11,594
Zhao Na, let's go

983
01:20:12,242 --> 01:20:15,325
Sister, I want to stay here and investigate

984
01:20:16,405 --> 01:20:20,202
I think that witch doctor is here

985
01:20:20,848 --> 01:20:21,457
Zhao Na

986
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:22,128
Sister

987
01:20:22,558 --> 01:20:24,531
If you want to get rid of Uncle's curse quickly

988
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:25,953
You have to catch a witch doctor

989
01:20:27,820 --> 01:20:28,590
Okay, got it

990
01:20:30,027 --> 01:20:34,199
But never do dangerous things

991
01:20:40,485 --> 01:20:41,410
Be careful

992
01:21:04,818 --> 01:21:06,441
If you look so stupidly

993
01:21:06,442 --> 01:21:08,766
Can you confirm your identity exactly?

994
01:21:10,025 --> 01:21:12,189
What should our team leader Zheng do?

995
01:21:12,190 --> 01:21:14,684
Long Xiu, do you know what my motto is?

996
01:21:15,067 --> 01:21:15,564
God will...

997
01:21:15,565 --> 01:21:17,705
God will bless the righteous

998
01:21:18,690 --> 01:21:19,640
That's it

999
01:21:20,068 --> 01:21:22,214
I'm tired of listening, and I've memorized it all

1000
01:21:23,399 --> 01:21:27,398
Is there a righteous person like Team Leader Zheng in this world?

1001
01:21:27,399 --> 01:21:29,619
God will bless

1002
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:30,931
Yes

1003
01:21:35,135 --> 01:21:36,479
Please come inside

1004
01:21:37,733 --> 01:21:38,620
It's here

1005
01:21:41,521 --> 01:21:42,794
Are you the reporter

1006
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:47,230
Thanks to the murderer this time

1007
01:21:47,231 --> 01:21:50,483
I’ve already promoted the company, so I’m very happy, right?

1008
01:21:52,786 --> 01:21:55,268
Okay, let's start the interview now

1009
01:21:59,187 --> 01:22:00,365
excuse me

1010
01:22:02,897 --> 01:22:04,811
I wanted to come early

1011
01:22:04,812 --> 01:22:07,101
But I ate kamabo sticks at the rest stop so I was late

1012
01:22:07,102 --> 01:22:10,021
This is a very rare opportunity as a researcher

1013
01:22:10,022 --> 01:22:11,894
I didn't expect to encounter such a powerful witch doctor

1014
01:22:11,895 --> 01:22:14,184
So nervous, he must be here, right?

1015
01:22:14,185 --> 01:22:15,603
Yes yes, got it

1016
01:22:15,604 --> 01:22:17,002
You take a look here first

1017
01:22:23,018 --> 01:22:26,467
This is not an ordinary tattoo

1018
01:22:26,934 --> 01:22:31,642
And amulets that exorcise ghosts or blessings

1019
01:22:31,643 --> 01:22:32,718
totally different

1020
01:22:37,534 --> 01:22:38,925
Is an invisible symbol

1021
01:22:40,017 --> 01:22:40,992
Stealth

1022
01:22:41,351 --> 01:22:43,293
Same as i did just now

1023
01:22:43,601 --> 01:22:47,929
If cursed, it will make people feel like there is nothing

1024
01:22:47,953 --> 01:22:48,783
(does not exist)

1025
01:22:48,807 --> 01:22:52,806
Yeah, it doesn't exist

1026
01:22:52,807 --> 01:22:54,892
So, in tidak ada

1027
01:22:54,893 --> 01:22:56,807
If you erase this tidak

1028
01:22:56,808 --> 01:22:58,432
But now you can’t just wipe it off

1029
01:23:04,224 --> 01:23:05,895
That will become the meaning of existence

1030
01:23:09,764 --> 01:23:15,417
Dear citizens, I am only thinking about the health of the people

1031
01:23:15,639 --> 01:23:18,498
For the past thirty years, as a representative of Shengri Pharmaceutical

1032
01:23:19,889 --> 01:23:23,018
However, recently due to unpleasant incidents

1033
01:23:23,514 --> 01:23:26,251
Let the people worry

1034
01:23:26,556 --> 01:23:27,613
Apologize for this

1035
01:23:29,543 --> 01:23:31,283
Dear citizens, I am only thinking about the health of the people. I have worked
as a representative of Katsuhichi Pharmaceutical for the past thirty years.
However, the recent unpleasant incidents
have caused the people to worry about it. We apologize for
that. Taking this as an opportunity, we will strive to become a more responsible company.
Thank you
, Bian Seung-il, Representative Director of Shengri Pharmaceutical

1036
01:23:32,972 --> 01:23:34,636
We will take this as an opportunity

1037
01:23:34,637 --> 01:23:38,303
Strive to become a more responsible company

1038
01:23:38,304 --> 01:23:39,093
thank you all

1039
01:23:41,364 --> 01:23:42,105
President

1040
01:23:43,238 --> 01:23:46,750
The murderer didn't ask you to apologize to the people

1041
01:23:47,553 --> 01:23:50,384
No, who should I apologize to

1042
01:23:50,635 --> 01:23:53,381
I have to apologize to the victim

1043
01:23:54,344 --> 01:23:57,092
Shengri Pharmaceutical Passes Illegal Clinical Trials and Causes 100 Deaths

1044
01:23:57,093 --> 01:23:58,566
And also hide this event

1045
01:23:59,387 --> 01:24:02,302
You are going to the dead victim

1046
01:24:02,303 --> 01:24:03,987
And apologize to their family

1047
01:24:04,927 --> 01:24:07,897
Well, I’m not sure about that

1048
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:10,926
But you make me apologize

1049
01:24:13,509 --> 01:24:14,954
I should apologize

1050
01:24:26,595 --> 01:24:27,758
sorry

1051
01:24:28,965 --> 01:24:31,711
I apologize to the victims of the clinical trial

1052
01:24:32,173 --> 01:24:33,412
It was my fault

1053
01:24:34,508 --> 01:24:36,181
Everyone who died and became the souls

1054
01:24:36,632 --> 01:24:38,103
I sincerely apologize to you

1055
01:24:39,132 --> 01:24:40,122
thanks

1056
01:24:41,881 --> 01:24:43,240
That's it

1057
01:24:43,412 --> 01:24:44,076
No way

1058
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:47,900
I won't broadcast such an insincere apology

1059
01:24:48,091 --> 01:24:50,038
Why do you judge like that

1060
01:24:50,299 --> 01:24:52,005
You just need to edit it and upload it to the Internet

1061
01:24:52,006 --> 01:24:52,498
President

1062
01:24:53,864 --> 01:24:55,188
Unless you really apologize

1063
01:24:55,213 --> 01:24:57,006
Otherwise this curse won't end

1064
01:24:57,007 --> 01:24:58,069
Can't you hear me?

1065
01:24:59,463 --> 01:25:00,279
curse

1066
01:25:02,672 --> 01:25:05,528
You're a junk reporter who got fired for talking crazy, right?

1067
01:25:07,795 --> 01:25:08,680
Really

1068
01:25:11,004 --> 01:25:11,962
Stop here

1069
01:25:11,963 --> 01:25:12,479
What?

1070
01:25:12,713 --> 01:25:16,570
Your dad will eventually die from the curse

1071
01:25:18,082 --> 01:25:19,086
Everyone withdraw

1072
01:25:19,087 --> 01:25:19,563
Meiying

1073
01:25:21,381 --> 01:25:22,381
I apologize

1074
01:25:22,629 --> 01:25:23,638
I will apologize

1075
01:25:32,837 --> 01:25:35,005
Senior, what is this

1076
01:25:35,712 --> 01:25:39,212
This seems to be a warehouse for corpses

1077
01:25:54,955 --> 01:25:57,428
Hello, everyone is on the ground carefully

1078
01:26:03,458 --> 01:26:04,355
symbol

1079
01:26:28,497 --> 01:26:30,295
(Date of change of residence place 2019.11.15)

1080
01:26:34,102 --> 01:26:37,433
That guy accepted reporter Lin’s interview because...

1081
01:26:50,540 --> 01:26:52,686
(Date of change of residence place 2019.11.15)

1082
01:27:24,743 --> 01:27:25,420
Don't

1083
01:27:59,699 --> 01:28:00,634
Reporter Lin

1084
01:28:04,032 --> 01:28:07,119
Does the person's apology now seem sincere?

1085
01:28:15,175 --> 01:28:19,737
My daughter wants to support her family

1086
01:28:19,738 --> 01:28:21,316
Did everything

1087
01:28:21,529 --> 01:28:25,229
Because of my useless curse ability

1088
01:28:26,079 --> 01:28:27,615
She did everything

1089
01:28:33,446 --> 01:28:34,716
But what about you

1090
01:28:38,987 --> 01:28:40,826
Can't say a decent apology

1091
01:28:53,693 --> 01:28:54,557
Jessie, don't

1092
01:28:57,485 --> 01:28:58,044
senior

1093
01:29:03,276 --> 01:29:05,192
Take care of the chairman

1094
01:29:05,661 --> 01:29:06,479
President

1095
01:29:07,693 --> 01:29:08,435
It's here

1096
01:29:16,191 --> 01:29:19,288
Get the equipment, hurry up

1097
01:29:19,546 --> 01:29:20,343
Got it

1098
01:31:00,302 --> 01:31:01,074
Zhao Na

1099
01:31:41,874 --> 01:31:43,132
Come on, Zhao Nao

1100
01:31:58,618 --> 01:31:59,601
Stop her

1101
01:31:59,906 --> 01:32:00,437
Fast

1102
01:32:03,137 --> 01:32:04,227
Here, hurry up

1103
01:32:42,787 --> 01:32:43,467
Please go in

1104
01:32:43,716 --> 01:32:45,044
I will block this monster

1105
01:32:45,742 --> 01:32:46,968
Isn't this the place where the accident happened?

1106
01:32:47,174 --> 01:32:48,265
Hurry up, dad

1107
01:32:48,717 --> 01:32:49,911
Scary

1108
01:32:51,404 --> 01:32:53,089
What are you doing in a daze, solve her quickly

1109
01:32:53,090 --> 01:32:53,510
Yes

1110
01:33:30,672 --> 01:33:33,546
sorry

1111
01:33:33,547 --> 01:33:35,463
Forgive me

1112
01:33:37,088 --> 01:33:39,467
sorry Sorry

1113
01:34:00,834 --> 01:34:04,423
Please, please, please

1114
01:34:17,625 --> 01:34:19,687
Please, please

1115
01:36:01,784 --> 01:36:04,019
Zhao Nao, Zhao Nao

1116
01:36:21,217 --> 01:36:22,667
Dad, are you okay

1117
01:36:29,762 --> 01:36:31,331
Where did you go and how did you show up?

1118
01:36:33,739 --> 01:36:37,434
Executive Li Shangren handed all the evidence to the police

1119
01:36:37,948 --> 01:36:40,905
Only the relevant person died

1120
01:36:40,906 --> 01:36:42,363
The company can survive

1121
01:36:50,697 --> 01:36:54,387
Dad, it took you a lot of hardships to get to this point

1122
01:36:57,214 --> 01:36:59,711
Your generation can take the responsibility to leave

1123
01:37:00,902 --> 01:37:02,615
To usher in a new world

1124
01:37:20,143 --> 01:37:21,970
Dad, thank you for your long-term care

1125
01:37:23,027 --> 01:37:23,772
You...

1126
01:37:24,108 --> 01:37:26,031
Dad, you can offload your important tasks now...

1127
01:37:27,106 --> 01:37:28,902
Have a good rest

1128
01:37:42,606 --> 01:37:43,731
Are you OK?

1129
01:37:44,770 --> 01:37:48,190
Dad, dad, please

1130
01:37:48,191 --> 01:37:51,482
Daddy

1131
01:37:53,398 --> 01:37:54,397
Daddy

1132
01:37:54,398 --> 01:37:57,231
Please calm down and sit here

1133
01:38:01,565 --> 01:38:02,833
Reporter Ren, are you okay?

1134
01:38:18,916 --> 01:38:19,604
Daddy

1135
01:38:19,605 --> 01:38:21,271
Stop pretending

1136
01:38:22,490 --> 01:38:24,131
Bian Meiying Specialist

1137
01:38:24,768 --> 01:38:27,533
The mastermind of this case confessed himself

1138
01:38:29,229 --> 01:38:30,232
And the evidence

1139
01:38:32,312 --> 01:38:34,064
It's all recorded here

1140
01:38:58,332 --> 01:39:01,164
Do you think that kind of thing can be evidence?

1141
01:39:01,518 --> 01:39:04,004
That kind of thing can be forged

1142
01:39:04,392 --> 01:39:06,515
Do you think I will fall because of this kind of thing?

1143
01:39:06,516 --> 01:39:08,391
What did you do to your father

1144
01:39:08,392 --> 01:39:10,349
And let him leave with his sins

1145
01:39:10,350 --> 01:39:14,432
Is this telling him to die? Wait, wait...

1146
01:39:14,433 --> 01:39:16,389
Many comments

1147
01:39:16,891 --> 01:39:18,467
It seems that the live broadcast went out

1148
01:39:37,785 --> 01:39:40,102
You dare to treat me like this

1149
01:39:43,473 --> 01:39:44,639
Please come with us

1150
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:45,478
let me go

1151
01:39:54,207 --> 01:39:56,719
In this way, have you helped justice again?

1152
01:39:58,567 --> 01:40:00,223
Our duty ends here

1153
01:40:29,168 --> 01:40:29,840
Zhao Na

1154
01:40:30,748 --> 01:40:31,631
Let's go

1155
01:40:36,033 --> 01:40:37,522
Don't blame yourself too much

1156
01:40:39,219 --> 01:40:40,708
Professor Zhuo once said

1157
01:40:41,384 --> 01:40:45,180
The witch doctor seems to want to be a sacrifice

1158
01:40:46,794 --> 01:40:47,638
I know

1159
01:40:49,511 --> 01:40:51,446
I'm afraid that witch doctor...

1160
01:40:52,344 --> 01:40:54,856
The final revenge is not Chairman Bian

1161
01:40:55,884 --> 01:40:57,766
But himself

1162
01:40:58,696 --> 01:41:01,231
When I touched him...

1163
01:41:46,850 --> 01:41:48,535
He called me

1164
01:41:50,254 --> 01:41:53,503
Don’t be like him, just clinging to the devil in your heart

1165
01:41:54,585 --> 01:41:57,798
Leading to the loss of those you love in the end

1166
01:42:43,574 --> 01:42:47,095
Behind

1167
01:43:09,294 --> 01:43:13,167
(3 months later)

1168
01:43:25,369 --> 01:43:27,881
Bian Meiying, the next president of Shengri Pharmaceutical

1169
01:43:28,286 --> 01:43:30,490
Acquitted on the grounds of insufficient evidence

1170
01:43:32,041 --> 01:43:33,330
News came out

1171
01:43:34,764 --> 01:43:35,819
So what?

1172
01:43:37,250 --> 01:43:38,583
Hurry up and hand over my car keys

1173
01:43:40,078 --> 01:43:42,337
Can't really apologize to the victims

1174
01:43:43,077 --> 01:43:44,990
Accept the sanctions of the law?

1175
01:43:46,244 --> 01:43:46,892
Really

1176
01:43:49,107 --> 01:43:50,146
What if I say no?

1177
01:43:51,276 --> 01:43:52,776
What can you do with me?

1178
01:43:53,922 --> 01:43:54,922
Items

1179
01:43:55,659 --> 01:43:56,913
Photo

1180
01:43:57,366 --> 01:43:58,452
and also

1181
01:43:59,515 --> 01:44:00,840
Chinese name

1182
01:44:02,972 --> 01:44:06,312
We don't want to make a bad decision

1183
01:44:16,935 --> 01:44:19,317
Law of slander: here it is
(there will be later, don’t leave)

1184
01:44:21,983 --> 01:45:44,222
Subtitle production: LLY
(only shared in apk, HD.Club intensive research)

1185
01:47:55,223 --> 01:47:57,889
Why... so few

1186
01:47:57,890 --> 01:47:58,887
Damn

1187
01:47:58,888 --> 01:48:02,511
Hey, you do less work and talk crazy all day long

1188
01:48:02,512 --> 01:48:03,298
Pull away

1189
01:48:03,722 --> 01:48:05,636
How can this be

1190
01:48:05,637 --> 01:48:07,262
Go, go

1191
01:48:07,263 --> 01:48:09,303
No, why are you doing this to me

1192
01:48:09,304 --> 01:48:11,138
Ask a fart, get out

1193
01:48:11,139 --> 01:48:12,636
Hey, don't come again

1194
01:48:12,636 --> 01:48:12,637
Worker name: Qian Zhoufeng

1195
01:48:12,637 --> 01:48:13,791
-I'll kill you again
-let me go

1196
01:48:15,386 --> 01:48:16,678
These damn guys

1197
01:49:03,458 --> 01:49:04,583
Master Taoist

1198
01:49:08,184 --> 01:49:09,684
Master Taoist
