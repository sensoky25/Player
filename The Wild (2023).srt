1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000

3
00:01:10,402 --> 00:01:11,918
Look up.

4
00:01:12,602 --> 00:01:14,137
Let us see your face.

5
00:01:17,235 --> 00:01:21,468
He's the guy that
killed your brother.

6
00:01:23,735 --> 00:01:27,802
I'll always be grateful
that you covered for me.

7
00:01:27,802 --> 00:01:29,802
Why are you taking the fall?

8
00:01:30,902 --> 00:01:34,035
Song Woo-chul, I sentence you
to eight years in prison.

9
00:02:29,169 --> 00:02:31,169
- Hey, friend!
- Bro!

10
00:02:32,703 --> 00:02:35,636
Good job
toughing it out.

11
00:02:35,636 --> 00:02:37,236
Ta-da!

12
00:02:37,236 --> 00:02:38,636
I decorated it myself.

13
00:02:41,303 --> 00:02:43,936
Have some more.
Isn't it good?

14
00:02:43,936 --> 00:02:46,136
Yeah, it's tasty.

15
00:02:46,436 --> 00:02:49,436
Here, you love cigarettes.

16
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:50,769
I'm going to quit.

17
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:53,069
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

18
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:54,069
Really?

19
00:02:56,769 --> 00:02:59,003
That's Kang Yoon-jae.

20
00:02:59,003 --> 00:03:00,803
He started working for me
a few years ago.

21
00:03:01,436 --> 00:03:02,303
Say hello.

22
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:07,536
Director Kang,
greet him properly.

23
00:03:07,536 --> 00:03:09,003
You work for him, too.

24
00:03:10,403 --> 00:03:11,436
It's fine.

25
00:03:11,436 --> 00:03:13,603
Hello.
That's enough.

26
00:03:14,036 --> 00:03:15,569
- Let's go, friend.
- Okay.

27
00:03:16,203 --> 00:03:16,969
Here we go!

28
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:26,003
Are there only scumbags
in prison nowadays?

29
00:03:26,127 --> 00:03:26,893
Why?

30
00:03:27,369 --> 00:03:30,603
You were released early
for good behavior.

31
00:03:30,603 --> 00:03:32,003
That's ridiculous.

32
00:03:32,071 --> 00:03:33,833
You jokester!

33
00:03:36,334 --> 00:03:38,634
You're a good guy.

34
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:43,567
There's a lot of work for you.

35
00:03:44,101 --> 00:03:46,734
The gambling house, the bar,
money loaning...

36
00:03:46,913 --> 00:03:50,246
The world is fucking big,
and there's a shit ton to do.

37
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:55,401
Do you want to
start with a bar?

38
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,435
Do-sik, I'm sorry.

39
00:03:58,201 --> 00:04:00,634
But I want a quiet life.

40
00:04:00,634 --> 00:04:01,434
What?

41
00:04:02,601 --> 00:04:03,967
How will you
earn a living?

42
00:04:05,101 --> 00:04:06,134
Who knows?

43
00:04:37,867 --> 00:04:38,801
Woo-chul...

44
00:04:39,634 --> 00:04:41,034
What was our dream?

45
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:47,634
Expensive cars,
big salaries, and...

46
00:04:48,867 --> 00:04:50,234
- Sexy girls!
- Sexy girls!

47
00:04:55,401 --> 00:04:56,067
Cheers.

48
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,927
I want to live
as quiet as a mouse.

49
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,510
You bastard.

50
00:05:04,177 --> 00:05:08,143
What will you get
if you live that way?

51
00:05:08,543 --> 00:05:10,543
Nothing at all.

52
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,143
That's the point.

53
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:20,110
I have everything, except
for a good friend.

54
00:05:21,077 --> 00:05:24,577
If you don't want this life,

55
00:05:24,577 --> 00:05:26,677
why did you hang out
with me back then?

56
00:05:26,677 --> 00:05:28,010
I was just...

57
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,977
- What is it?
- Director Kang called.

58
00:05:36,043 --> 00:05:37,043
Yes, Yoon-jae?

59
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:40,810
What?

60
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,177
That bastard...

61
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:45,243
All right.

62
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,543
I need to get going.
Something came up.

63
00:05:50,543 --> 00:05:51,510
Nothing serious, right?

64
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,777
Of course not.
This happens all the time.

65
00:05:54,177 --> 00:05:56,677
You know what to do, right?

66
00:05:56,677 --> 00:05:58,210
Make sure he has
the time of his life.

67
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,377
Yes, sir!

68
00:05:59,377 --> 00:06:05,077
Woo-chul, enjoy your surprise.

69
00:06:05,077 --> 00:06:06,543
I'll see you at
the office tomorrow.

70
00:06:07,043 --> 00:06:08,543
- See you.
- Bye.

71
00:06:08,543 --> 00:06:10,243
- Goodbye, sir!
- Bye.

72
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,010
Where's Do-sik?

73
00:06:19,677 --> 00:06:23,410
- Go on up without me.
- Come with me!

74
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:27,110
- I'll go get some beer.
- Beer?

75
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,643
It's Room 1004.
The passcode is 1234.

76
00:06:30,643 --> 00:06:34,343
- Room 1004, 1234?
- Yeah.

77
00:06:34,343 --> 00:06:36,643
- Room 1004, 1234?
- That's right.

78
00:06:38,677 --> 00:06:39,910
Yes!

79
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:57,177
'Woo-chul, she'll whip you
into a good worker.'

80
00:06:57,177 --> 00:06:58,710
'Your friend Do-sik.'

81
00:07:02,377 --> 00:07:05,177
What took you so long?
I was waiting forever.

82
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,643
Miss, I'm not...

83
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,210
Here's your welcome drink.

84
00:07:16,977 --> 00:07:18,110
I'm Bom.

85
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,610
I think I'll just leave...

86
00:07:21,877 --> 00:07:24,710
Sorry, but I already spent
the money I was paid.

87
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,277
My friend just went
to get some...

88
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,202
Hold on...

89
00:07:30,227 --> 00:07:31,327
Let me do my job.

90
00:07:31,989 --> 00:07:34,522
Miss, hold on.

91
00:07:34,547 --> 00:07:38,617
Wait, my friend went to
buy some beers...

92
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:55,910
It's obvious what happened,
so don't stare.

93
00:08:02,143 --> 00:08:03,577
I'll shower first.

94
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,710
He really went all out.
Is she breathing?

95
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,143
Yes, she is.

96
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,943
- Clean up this mess.
- Yes, boss.

97
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:33,310
- Did you call Madam Han?
- Yes, I did.

98
00:08:33,743 --> 00:08:36,343
Why aren't you
answering your phone?

99
00:08:36,343 --> 00:08:37,277
Hey!

100
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:43,110
Why are you screwing over
your man, you bitch?

101
00:08:44,843 --> 00:08:48,043
President Jang, it's you.

102
00:08:48,877 --> 00:08:53,677
It's so hard to
see you nowadays.

103
00:08:53,677 --> 00:08:57,043
Why is my life
so meaningless?

104
00:08:58,977 --> 00:09:03,677
I didn't help you out
to see you like this.

105
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:06,843
Fuck, why are you messing with
someone else's business?

106
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:11,610
Don't.

107
00:09:12,277 --> 00:09:13,610
President Jang...

108
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:17,377
I know we're close friends.

109
00:09:17,377 --> 00:09:21,743
But we promised we wouldn't
swear at each other.

110
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:29,010
Director Kang...

111
00:09:33,477 --> 00:09:36,477
This situation is
shitty, right?

112
00:09:36,477 --> 00:09:38,177
It's so shitty.

113
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:44,210
You're fighting the urge to
kill me, aren't you?

114
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:50,410
You shouldn't glare at
someone like that.

115
00:10:07,043 --> 00:10:10,577
It's because
I don't have money.

116
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:15,077
That's what I keep telling you,
President Jang!

117
00:10:16,043 --> 00:10:17,477
Don't be greedy.

118
00:10:18,943 --> 00:10:20,643
We need to keep
a low profile.

119
00:10:25,577 --> 00:10:28,277
If we get rid of the
North Korean defectors,

120
00:10:28,277 --> 00:10:29,710
we'll make 10 times more!

121
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,010
How many times do
I have to tell you?

122
00:10:32,477 --> 00:10:35,710
Let's just sell it directly!

123
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:39,043
Then, I'll be able
to leave Korea.

124
00:10:39,043 --> 00:10:42,643
I'll spend all of my days
just doing drugs.

125
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:46,077
You want me to get out
of your hair, don't you?

126
00:10:48,077 --> 00:10:51,877
Let's wait for
the right moment.

127
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,643
- Really?
- Of course.

128
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,310
Okay.

129
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,510
Okay, okay.

130
00:11:04,719 --> 00:11:07,253
Just sleep here.
Where are you off to?

131
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:09,235
I'm going to find Bom.

132
00:11:09,743 --> 00:11:15,177
Sex with her is
just amazing.

133
00:11:15,177 --> 00:11:16,703
Stop that.

134
00:11:16,823 --> 00:11:19,823
I've told you, she's
Madam Han's favorite.

135
00:11:19,886 --> 00:11:21,070
So what?

136
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:23,549
Don't worry.

137
00:11:24,578 --> 00:11:27,365
I love her, after all.

138
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,021
Watch yourself.

139
00:11:31,271 --> 00:11:32,843
Bastard...

140
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:07,977
Get the product.

141
00:12:11,943 --> 00:12:13,243
I'm leaving.

142
00:12:13,243 --> 00:12:14,277
No refunds.

143
00:12:19,245 --> 00:12:20,185
Yes, Madam?

144
00:12:20,293 --> 00:12:23,660
Bom, Cho Jeong-gon
is looking for you.

145
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:26,863
He doesn't know
that I moved.

146
00:12:26,888 --> 00:12:29,322
Don't go home.
Stay there.

147
00:12:29,477 --> 00:12:30,710
Okay.

148
00:12:49,843 --> 00:12:51,443
Can you turn off the lights?

149
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,777
- Do you have insomnia?
- Yeah.

150
00:13:07,043 --> 00:13:08,277
Look up.

151
00:13:08,943 --> 00:13:10,543
Let us see your face.

152
00:13:12,477 --> 00:13:13,910
Take a good look.

153
00:13:15,077 --> 00:13:19,577
He's the guy that
killed your brother.

154
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:23,910
Song Woo-chul, I sentence you
to eight years in prison.

155
00:13:49,939 --> 00:13:55,001
Go to sleep, baby

156
00:13:55,717 --> 00:14:00,702
Go to sleep, baby

157
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:40,610
Please find me work on a boat that
goes far away for a long time.

158
00:14:42,677 --> 00:14:45,077
I guess you're
desperate for money.

159
00:14:47,777 --> 00:14:52,477
There's a crab fishing boat that
departs three days from now.

160
00:15:48,277 --> 00:15:50,410
I didn't think you'd
actually call me.

161
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,443
Who did that to you?

162
00:15:52,443 --> 00:15:54,410
Did you call the cops?

163
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,510
The cops?

164
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,810
It would be hilarious
if I called the cops.

165
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:09,077
Do you know what's funny?

166
00:16:09,077 --> 00:16:14,410
I willingly go see
that son of a bitch.

167
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:21,710
Because...

168
00:16:28,277 --> 00:16:29,977
I quit that stuff.

169
00:16:31,543 --> 00:16:33,210
For the tenth time.

170
00:16:36,277 --> 00:16:37,710
Let's leave.

171
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:41,443
You won't be able to see flowers
on that crab fishing boat.

172
00:16:45,743 --> 00:16:46,843
Were you a boxer?

173
00:16:47,577 --> 00:16:48,343
Huh?

174
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:53,710
Yeah, for a while.
How did you know?

175
00:16:54,843 --> 00:16:56,377
I learned it a little.

176
00:16:58,243 --> 00:17:00,010
All boxers get
the same habit.

177
00:17:08,577 --> 00:17:09,710
I'm going this way.

178
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:17,310
All right.

179
00:17:21,643 --> 00:17:23,777
You want me tonight?

180
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:28,310
No, I'm just...

181
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:31,043
Sorry, I'm feeling blue.

182
00:17:31,977 --> 00:17:36,810
It's fine, thanks for
drinking with me.

183
00:18:09,177 --> 00:18:12,410
It was today.

184
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,377
You know,
Kim Ji-hwan...

185
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,743
More, more!

186
00:18:28,143 --> 00:18:31,710
You're doing great!
You can do it!

187
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,877
Circle him.

188
00:18:38,477 --> 00:18:40,343
That's it!

189
00:18:47,577 --> 00:18:51,043
- Time out!
- That's a foul!

190
00:18:56,443 --> 00:18:57,410
What the fuck!

191
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,110
That's foul play!

192
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:04,143
- That bastard!
- What's the referee doing?

193
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,177
Are you okay?

194
00:19:06,577 --> 00:19:08,543
You're doing great.

195
00:19:08,543 --> 00:19:11,477
He's quick on his feet,
so hit his body...

196
00:19:11,477 --> 00:19:13,243
Shut your mouth.

197
00:19:14,043 --> 00:19:15,110
Is the betting over?

198
00:19:20,777 --> 00:19:21,777
Friend...

199
00:19:22,743 --> 00:19:24,943
- You're the underdog today.
- Is that so?

200
00:19:24,943 --> 00:19:27,143
Your opponent's a big guy.

201
00:19:27,143 --> 00:19:29,943
Bookies from all over
the country are here.

202
00:19:29,943 --> 00:19:34,743
They'll broadcast the match
and take bets until Round 1.

203
00:19:39,477 --> 00:19:42,277
Betting time is almost
over, people!

204
00:20:02,924 --> 00:20:03,924
That's it!

205
00:20:04,112 --> 00:20:07,979
Keep going!
That's it!

206
00:20:15,943 --> 00:20:18,843
Fuck, this is bullshit!

207
00:20:22,077 --> 00:20:24,077
- Okay!
- Great job!

208
00:20:29,843 --> 00:20:31,743
What's that bastard doing?

209
00:20:56,077 --> 00:20:57,710
We won!

210
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,410
Son of a bitch!

211
00:21:22,743 --> 00:21:24,177
Call an ambulance!

212
00:21:28,843 --> 00:21:30,610
Why would you go there?

213
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:33,243
His mom's remains
are there, too.

214
00:21:33,243 --> 00:21:37,077
She just couldn't
move on with her life.

215
00:21:38,243 --> 00:21:40,743
She got sick, and
died a few years ago.

216
00:21:41,943 --> 00:21:43,210
Look up.

217
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,510
Let us see your face.

218
00:22:20,243 --> 00:22:21,343
Were you a boxer?

219
00:22:21,343 --> 00:22:23,077
All boxers get
the same habit.

220
00:22:53,277 --> 00:22:58,077
- Come with me, bitch!
- I'm sorry!

221
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:10,210
Follow me!

222
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,743
Say 'ah'.

223
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:26,977
Stay just like that.

224
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:30,443
Here's something for your mouth.
Don't use your teeth.

225
00:23:33,343 --> 00:23:37,810
Woo-chul, don't get into
any trouble for a while.

226
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,277
Bastard!

227
00:24:15,243 --> 00:24:16,243
Who the fuck are you?

228
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,543
You bastard...

229
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:45,710
If you touch Bom again,
I'll kill you for good.

230
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:52,110
I'll remember your face,
address and name.

231
00:25:01,243 --> 00:25:04,610
You're fucked, idiot.

232
00:25:18,377 --> 00:25:21,910
Please leave a message
after the beep...

233
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:24,110
Detective Cho isn't answering.

234
00:25:24,877 --> 00:25:27,577
That fucking druggie...

235
00:25:47,908 --> 00:25:51,175
Hey, I don't see
Cho Jeong-gon.

236
00:25:54,371 --> 00:25:57,598
Why did you bring so many men
for a business deal?

237
00:25:57,852 --> 00:26:00,591
That's why people
call you gangsters.

238
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:02,989
I won't make a deal
without Cho Jeong-gon.

239
00:26:03,014 --> 00:26:05,270
We're called gangsters
because we are gangsters.

240
00:26:05,895 --> 00:26:09,365
And it's not my fault Cho Jeong-gon
isn't answering his phone.

241
00:26:11,477 --> 00:26:14,510
We're all South Koreans now,
so we should trust each other.

242
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:20,677
Distrust is what's at
the heart of our profit.

243
00:26:20,677 --> 00:26:23,443
You want to keep
waiting, then?

244
00:26:23,443 --> 00:26:24,377
Do we have a choice?

245
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,977
Store the product.

246
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:31,077
- Goodbye.
- Get going.

247
00:26:31,077 --> 00:26:32,043
Shit...

248
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:34,743
Hurry up.

249
00:26:40,143 --> 00:26:42,410
Woo-chul, I'm handling
some business.

250
00:26:43,943 --> 00:26:45,010
An accident?

251
00:26:57,577 --> 00:26:59,677
I'll take care of it.

252
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:05,243
- What about you?
- Don't worry.

253
00:27:05,243 --> 00:27:06,877
It's either money or life.

254
00:27:08,243 --> 00:27:09,610
I'll handle it myself.

255
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:13,110
No, you'll end up
in prison again.

256
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,643
Stop frowning, idiot!

257
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:20,977
Didn't that bitch tell you
that he was a cop?

258
00:27:20,977 --> 00:27:23,177
I went after him
before asking.

259
00:27:26,843 --> 00:27:28,877
She's being foxy.

260
00:27:28,877 --> 00:27:30,643
I'm sorry, Do-sik.

261
00:27:35,643 --> 00:27:37,143
There is one way...

262
00:27:40,097 --> 00:27:42,072
Never mind.

263
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:44,760
Leave before
I change my mind.

264
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:45,943
Get going.

265
00:28:03,477 --> 00:28:06,410
What way do you mean?

266
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:19,210
It's risky, but
it might be worth it.

267
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:35,943
If we're going after Gak-su,
we need to be prepared.

268
00:28:36,777 --> 00:28:39,677
One wrong move, and
we're screwed.

269
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,177
We'll lose everything.

270
00:28:42,177 --> 00:28:46,777
But with you by my side,
we might have a chance.

271
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:08,010
He has guts and loyalty.

272
00:29:09,643 --> 00:29:11,610
Isn't he a substitute?

273
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:12,910
In case things go wrong?

274
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:14,377
I told you, he's my friend.

275
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:19,643
Plus, I have plenty of men
that could become substitutes.

276
00:29:20,777 --> 00:29:27,210
You're not loyal to me.
That's the problem.

277
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:28,510
Nice to meet you.

278
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,977
I'm Han Su-jin.

279
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:34,710
Detective Cho, you should spend
your remaining years in Thailand.

280
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:38,243
Get massages and
have sex all day long.

281
00:29:44,677 --> 00:29:45,543
Okay.

282
00:29:46,177 --> 00:29:49,843
I have a work life and
a personal life.

283
00:29:49,843 --> 00:29:52,710
I can forgive him
as a police detective.

284
00:29:53,577 --> 00:29:57,643
But personally...

285
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,177
I'm having some trouble.

286
00:30:07,677 --> 00:30:11,263
Oh, geez...

287
00:30:16,444 --> 00:30:18,289
Don't agitate our boss.

288
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:22,810
He seems to be
excited about this.

289
00:30:32,108 --> 00:30:33,808
He wants to talk to you.

290
00:30:34,897 --> 00:30:37,430
Let's think positively.

291
00:30:55,043 --> 00:30:58,110
- Did you check out Gak-su?
- He's not up to anything.

292
00:30:59,077 --> 00:31:01,443
Boss, are you sure
about this?

293
00:31:05,043 --> 00:31:07,543
Why?
Are you worried?

294
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,410
Amateurs accept
the hand they're dealt.

295
00:31:12,343 --> 00:31:14,277
But pros build
their own hand.

296
00:31:14,843 --> 00:31:16,043
Perfectly.

297
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:32,310
That's the stuff!

298
00:31:54,277 --> 00:31:56,543
Here...

299
00:31:57,977 --> 00:31:59,443
It's your turn to drink.

300
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:06,210
Bottoms up.

301
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:31,810
There's a problem
with the product?

302
00:32:37,777 --> 00:32:40,210
He's a long-time friend.

303
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:41,710
He's going to start
working for Madam Han.

304
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:45,277
Say hello to Director
Song Woo-chul.

305
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:51,777
Let me pour you a drink.

306
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:03,277
We should clink our glasses.

307
00:33:14,677 --> 00:33:19,277
Someone from Lab 216
in Pyeong-yang contacted me.

308
00:33:20,077 --> 00:33:22,477
The factory was raided.

309
00:33:22,477 --> 00:33:23,210
What?

310
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:27,710
They can't restart production
until the end of summer.

311
00:33:28,777 --> 00:33:32,710
Luckily, they sent all of
the finished product.

312
00:33:33,343 --> 00:33:34,677
It's a lot.

313
00:33:36,777 --> 00:33:39,043
About 40kg.

314
00:33:39,043 --> 00:33:43,377
But the government is
cracking down on us.

315
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:46,410
I can't go get it
right away.

316
00:33:47,277 --> 00:33:52,210
I'll go on May 1st,
since it's a holiday.

317
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:56,077
We don't have enough money
for that amount of product.

318
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:02,177
Come on, President Jang!

319
00:34:02,177 --> 00:34:04,710
Why are you
worried about that?

320
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,810
Just buy your usual amount.

321
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:09,310
What a kidder!

322
00:34:19,677 --> 00:34:22,177
You said your family
name is Song?

323
00:34:22,177 --> 00:34:23,477
Which Song family?

324
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,577
The Yeosan family.

325
00:34:26,743 --> 00:34:30,177
I had a good
feeling about you.

326
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:34,377
My mother is from
the Yeosan family, too.

327
00:34:34,377 --> 00:34:36,877
Nice to meet you.
I'm Ri Gak-su.

328
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:54,477
- We're moving to an apartment.
- Good for you.

329
00:34:54,477 --> 00:34:58,410
It's 43㎡, with four rooms
and two bathrooms!

330
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,677
Stop bragging.

331
00:35:00,077 --> 00:35:03,510
It's a good day, so
let me feel happy.

332
00:35:15,977 --> 00:35:18,443
Whoa, bro...

333
00:35:18,443 --> 00:35:19,477
Do I look okay?

334
00:35:19,477 --> 00:35:20,893
You've still got it.

335
00:35:22,977 --> 00:35:25,010
Why would a man
wear perfume?

336
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:27,477
We have to work
with ladies.

337
00:35:27,477 --> 00:35:28,543
It's manners.

338
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:30,243
Want some?

339
00:35:32,477 --> 00:35:33,377
Manners?

340
00:35:47,443 --> 00:35:48,643
I'm Chae-ah.

341
00:35:48,643 --> 00:35:50,710
- Ra-hee.
- I'm Ra-hee.

342
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:53,143
- Se-yeon.
- I'm Se-yeon.

343
00:35:53,143 --> 00:35:54,710
- Ye-ri.
- I'm Ye-ri.

344
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:57,510
Ye-ri just turned
20 years old.

345
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,577
Bro, she's just my type.

346
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:03,577
Never mind.

347
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:08,077
Finally, there's Bom.

348
00:36:10,443 --> 00:36:11,877
You two have met, right?

349
00:36:13,477 --> 00:36:16,710
If there are any problems,
tell Director Song.

350
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:20,277
- What about Director Kang?
- You can tell him, too.

351
00:36:20,277 --> 00:36:23,643
Ye-ri, Director Song
can solve anything.

352
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:26,977
That's why President Jang
asked him to work here.

353
00:36:30,665 --> 00:36:31,765
Let's get ready.

354
00:36:32,439 --> 00:36:34,489
Welcome, sir!

355
00:36:42,677 --> 00:36:47,310
You son of a bitch!
You don't even have money!

356
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:49,243
Please stop!

357
00:36:49,243 --> 00:36:52,643
Just one more bottle!

358
00:37:20,996 --> 00:37:23,596
Can we go all the way?

359
00:37:23,643 --> 00:37:26,343
How much do
I have to pay?

360
00:37:26,368 --> 00:37:29,121
Stop playing hard to get.

361
00:37:44,043 --> 00:37:46,643
- Come here!
- Where are we going?

362
00:37:46,643 --> 00:37:48,110
Come on.

363
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,877
Do you really love me?

364
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:56,043
Of course, I do.

365
00:38:10,343 --> 00:38:11,810
Lie down, like me.

366
00:38:12,443 --> 00:38:14,310
The stars are beautiful.

367
00:38:16,477 --> 00:38:18,243
What nonsense.

368
00:38:20,377 --> 00:38:22,277
Don't do drugs when
you're supposed to work.

369
00:38:22,277 --> 00:38:25,910
My mind is cloudy when
I don't do drugs.

370
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:41,677
When we were young,
we fought all the fucking time.

371
00:38:41,677 --> 00:38:45,277
I guess that's why
I love you now.

372
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:50,743
What did he say?

373
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:53,977
It's his chance to get
revenge on you.

374
00:38:53,977 --> 00:38:55,310
Of course he's in.

375
00:38:56,243 --> 00:38:58,210
We'll go after
Cho Jeong-gon, too.

376
00:38:58,877 --> 00:39:02,010
I'm Jang Do-sik.
I shouldn't take orders.

377
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:04,810
I told him that we'll make
you the victim.

378
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:05,943
Play along for a while.

379
00:39:07,643 --> 00:39:10,910
People of Korea,
we're fucked.

380
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:18,410
Gangsters were fighting over
drugs from North Korea.

381
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:24,410
One of them had a knife, so
Detective Cho shot him dead.

382
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:27,010
That's not all.

383
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:29,843
We're even more fucked.

384
00:39:30,477 --> 00:39:34,043
All of the drugs
have disappeared.

385
00:39:34,043 --> 00:39:37,243
The police are trying
to track them down.

386
00:39:37,243 --> 00:39:38,243
The end!

387
00:39:40,043 --> 00:39:42,710
It's perfect, isn't it?

388
00:39:43,277 --> 00:39:45,043
Don't try to act too much.

389
00:39:45,977 --> 00:39:48,777
You know you're
a bad liar, right?

390
00:39:48,777 --> 00:39:50,243
You're too naive.

391
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:57,410
Get going, then.

392
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:58,877
You have work to do.

393
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:00,877
Bye.

394
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:10,043
You bastard...

395
00:40:10,777 --> 00:40:14,477
I know what you're planning,
you son of a bitch.

396
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:20,643
The weather's great.

397
00:40:21,643 --> 00:40:22,810
Want to have a drink?

398
00:40:32,077 --> 00:40:35,077
Which one should
I wear today?

399
00:40:36,743 --> 00:40:37,977
This one's prettier.

400
00:40:55,643 --> 00:40:57,043
You bastard!

401
00:40:58,243 --> 00:41:01,210
Fucking moron...

402
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:02,877
Director Kang!

403
00:41:03,977 --> 00:41:07,277
We love each other!

404
00:41:07,277 --> 00:41:08,910
Stop with your bullshit.

405
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:10,143
No, wait!

406
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:16,777
Woo-chul...

407
00:41:17,543 --> 00:41:20,610
Kang, what's going on?

408
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:25,743
This prick fucked
one of the girls.

409
00:41:25,743 --> 00:41:29,010
No, we're dating.

410
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:30,443
You son of a bitch...

411
00:41:31,177 --> 00:41:33,643
Brother, that's enough.

412
00:41:37,777 --> 00:41:39,077
I'm asking you to stop.

413
00:41:42,077 --> 00:41:43,810
Fuck, listen carefully.

414
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:50,243
If we get involved
with the girls...

415
00:41:50,843 --> 00:41:53,677
They start acting like
they own the place.

416
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,610
Then, shit will hit the fan.

417
00:42:00,577 --> 00:42:01,710
Get it?

418
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:03,810
Director Song?

419
00:42:11,477 --> 00:42:13,943
- We're here.
- Is this the place?

420
00:42:18,677 --> 00:42:20,277
Whoa...

421
00:42:20,277 --> 00:42:23,277
Yang-gi, this place
looks expensive.

422
00:42:23,277 --> 00:42:24,210
Have you got money?

423
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:26,243
Don't worry!

424
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:30,243
We'll get to moisten
our throats.

425
00:42:30,743 --> 00:42:34,243
I want to moisten
my dick first!

426
00:42:34,943 --> 00:42:36,177
You sick bastard.

427
00:42:36,877 --> 00:42:37,777
Me, too!

428
00:42:39,577 --> 00:42:41,210
It's about to get rowdy.

429
00:42:41,877 --> 00:42:42,877
Director Song.

430
00:42:43,577 --> 00:42:45,910
Whatever they do,
don't get involved.

431
00:42:48,243 --> 00:42:51,843
Wow, this feels great!

432
00:42:53,443 --> 00:42:58,043
Yang-gi, why are you
taking so long to piss?

433
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:04,043
Why do you have to
interrupt our fun?

434
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:08,843
Pretty girl,
we're not done yet!

435
00:43:10,443 --> 00:43:11,943
Hey...

436
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:14,077
Where are you going?

437
00:43:14,077 --> 00:43:15,910
You have to go
upstairs for sex.

438
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:17,277
Come here!

439
00:43:17,277 --> 00:43:22,643
You still have your panties on,
so what's the problem?

440
00:43:22,643 --> 00:43:25,343
- I'm shy.
- Is that so?

441
00:43:25,343 --> 00:43:27,877
- Excuse me...
- Get lost, bastard!

442
00:43:33,943 --> 00:43:37,910
What a mean chick.
Let's go have sex, then.

443
00:43:44,177 --> 00:43:48,377
Yeah, it is better
when you're drunk!

444
00:43:48,377 --> 00:43:49,943
You should drink, too!

445
00:43:49,943 --> 00:43:55,277
You got free food in North Korea,
and you want the same here.

446
00:43:55,277 --> 00:43:56,477
What did you say?

447
00:43:57,077 --> 00:44:01,110
You fucking defectors are
living off of our taxes.

448
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:02,810
- Bom, stop!
- I'm telling the truth.

449
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:04,277
You fucking bitch!

450
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:10,843
What did you just say
with your dirty mouth?

451
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:12,777
You fucking...

452
00:44:18,143 --> 00:44:19,677
You want a war with us?

453
00:44:20,377 --> 00:44:21,210
Director Kang...

454
00:44:21,877 --> 00:44:24,543
Director Kang!
Director Kang!

455
00:44:26,577 --> 00:44:27,510
Damn it...

456
00:44:30,343 --> 00:44:31,543
I'm so sorry.

457
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:33,110
There must be
a misunderstanding.

458
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:35,510
Director Song,
let go of him.

459
00:44:36,377 --> 00:44:38,210
Song Woo-chul,
you son of a bitch.

460
00:44:38,877 --> 00:44:41,110
Stop acting like you're married
and let go of him.

461
00:44:47,043 --> 00:44:50,443
- Are you okay?
- I'll kill him!

462
00:45:03,277 --> 00:45:04,210
Son of a bitch!

463
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:08,243
You bastard...

464
00:45:12,577 --> 00:45:13,543
You...

465
00:45:23,443 --> 00:45:26,310
Just leave me alone.

466
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:28,843
Leave me alone.

467
00:45:28,843 --> 00:45:31,477
Leave me alone,
you son of a bitch!

468
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:51,777
- Gil-tae!
- I just drank alcohol.

469
00:45:51,777 --> 00:45:53,110
I didn't have sex.

470
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:56,777
I really didn't have sex!

471
00:45:57,377 --> 00:45:58,577
Mr. Policeman!

472
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:02,277
Why didn't you call me
first, you bitch?

473
00:46:02,277 --> 00:46:03,943
A customer called the police.

474
00:46:05,977 --> 00:46:07,143
Fuck...

475
00:46:09,443 --> 00:46:12,610
- Detective Kim, I'll handle this.
- Yes, sir.

476
00:46:15,543 --> 00:46:16,910
Let's have a chat.

477
00:46:19,177 --> 00:46:21,210
Follow me, you bastard.

478
00:46:22,743 --> 00:46:26,277
Are you ruining our
business on purpose?

479
00:46:27,543 --> 00:46:30,177
Fuck, just stay away.

480
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:34,677
You fucking
son of a bitch...

481
00:46:55,443 --> 00:46:58,310
Fuck, let me look at you.

482
00:46:58,310 --> 00:46:59,910
Stay still, you bastard.

483
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:02,343
You're young.
Who the hell are you?

484
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:04,643
Who sent you?

485
00:47:05,443 --> 00:47:08,177
You killed my brother,
you son of a bitch!

486
00:47:33,977 --> 00:47:38,910
If he presses charges,
it counts as attempted murder.

487
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:40,977
I'll just go to prison.

488
00:47:40,977 --> 00:47:43,110
Even a murderer
only gets 7 years.

489
00:47:44,643 --> 00:47:45,910
You brat...

490
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:50,710
We got Ms. Choi's statement.
Is she allowed to leave?

491
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:53,410
Yes, see her off.
Make sure she's safe.

492
00:47:54,877 --> 00:47:56,110
Myung-joo?

493
00:47:58,010 --> 00:47:59,177
It's you, right?

494
00:48:00,943 --> 00:48:04,177
That bastard ruined
both of our lives.

495
00:48:06,777 --> 00:48:08,743
It was a boxing accident.

496
00:48:11,443 --> 00:48:12,310
An accident?

497
00:48:13,543 --> 00:48:15,443
You of all people
shouldn't say that.

498
00:48:21,377 --> 00:48:25,210
My brother fought with my mom
right before he died.

499
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:30,410
He asked for $5,000 because
he wanted to get you a place to live.

500
00:48:31,143 --> 00:48:38,077
Before my mom died, she regretted
not giving him that money.

501
00:48:41,843 --> 00:48:44,010
So, apologize.

502
00:48:45,377 --> 00:48:48,810
Apologize for calling it
a fucking accident!

503
00:48:49,877 --> 00:48:51,043
I'm sorry.

504
00:48:56,477 --> 00:48:57,543
By the way...

505
00:48:58,610 --> 00:49:00,643
Do you have some money?

506
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:27,177
There's someone
I feel guilt toward.

507
00:49:29,543 --> 00:49:32,443
I don't know how long
I should feel this way.

508
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:40,377
It's because he died.

509
00:49:53,777 --> 00:49:55,877
Could you go
buy me a beer?

510
00:49:55,877 --> 00:49:57,810
Sure.

511
00:49:57,810 --> 00:49:59,910
Get some snacks, too.

512
00:50:01,177 --> 00:50:03,510
- Nothing else?
- No, thanks.

513
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:22,977
Look underneath.

514
00:50:31,243 --> 00:50:32,977
Use it when you
take a shit.

515
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:40,610
It's a gift.

516
00:50:56,877 --> 00:50:58,977
You want me to stop
bothering you, right?

517
00:51:00,177 --> 00:51:02,343
Then, Ms. Choi Myung-joo...

518
00:51:03,243 --> 00:51:05,410
You'll need to work with me.

519
00:51:11,043 --> 00:51:13,743
This phone is the latest model,
so I checked it out.

520
00:51:13,743 --> 00:51:14,843
Is that so?

521
00:51:14,843 --> 00:51:16,810
I don't know much
about that stuff.

522
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:18,477
The picture quality
is great, too.

523
00:51:21,977 --> 00:51:24,210
One, two, three!

524
00:51:37,077 --> 00:51:40,243
He embarrassed me.
I can't stay still.

525
00:51:42,877 --> 00:51:43,777
I understand.

526
00:51:44,443 --> 00:51:47,310
But please think of
my situation.

527
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:51,110
If I embarrassed him,
would you do nothing?

528
00:51:54,377 --> 00:51:55,977
I shouldn't have said that.

529
00:51:55,977 --> 00:51:57,410
Please forgive me, boss.

530
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:03,343
We need Woo-chul
for this plan.

531
00:52:09,977 --> 00:52:12,343
After I beat everyone
and sell off the product,

532
00:52:12,343 --> 00:52:16,110
I'll leave this small
town for Seoul.

533
00:52:19,443 --> 00:52:21,243
Don't look so shocked.

534
00:52:21,243 --> 00:52:23,210
I'm bringing you with me.

535
00:52:26,077 --> 00:52:27,977
Look at that happy face.

536
00:52:29,877 --> 00:52:31,577
Let's go to Seoul.

537
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:34,743
Hyun-tae.

538
00:52:37,477 --> 00:52:38,510
Park Hyun-tae?

539
00:52:40,343 --> 00:52:41,543
Where did he go?

540
00:52:42,843 --> 00:52:45,810
Bro, mind your manners!

541
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:48,010
Hello, Director!

542
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:51,210
You're dating one
of the girls, too.

543
00:52:52,643 --> 00:52:54,643
It's not like that.

544
00:52:56,243 --> 00:52:57,610
What are you thinking?

545
00:52:57,610 --> 00:52:59,743
I want to sell drugs, too.

546
00:53:01,977 --> 00:53:03,543
- What?
- Bro...

547
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:07,243
Ye-ri owes Madam Han $70K.

548
00:53:07,243 --> 00:53:11,243
Please persuade Do-sik
to let me be part of it.

549
00:53:11,243 --> 00:53:12,710
He does whatever you ask.

550
00:53:28,343 --> 00:53:31,743
Dog meat is great
for your health.

551
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:34,510
We'll be healthy for
the whole year.

552
00:53:37,343 --> 00:53:39,243
Did the smell of meat
bring you here?

553
00:53:42,643 --> 00:53:43,843
Hurry up...

554
00:53:44,677 --> 00:53:46,210
Why did you bring him?

555
00:53:47,943 --> 00:53:48,910
Get lost!

556
00:53:49,943 --> 00:53:51,010
Let him stay.

557
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:54,177
Director Song must think
he's trustworthy.

558
00:53:55,377 --> 00:53:57,210
He's not looking so good.

559
00:54:06,777 --> 00:54:08,443
I'm sorry.

560
00:54:08,443 --> 00:54:10,177
I'm still getting
used to the job.

561
00:54:12,343 --> 00:54:17,743
They wanted to kill you,
but I managed to stop them.

562
00:54:17,743 --> 00:54:19,643
I'm in your debt, Mr. Ri.

563
00:54:19,643 --> 00:54:21,410
I know you'll repay it.

564
00:54:21,410 --> 00:54:22,477
Did you hear my offer?

565
00:54:23,043 --> 00:54:25,477
I'll buy all of the product
at 150% the price.

566
00:54:25,477 --> 00:54:27,377
Tell me the exact date.

567
00:54:27,377 --> 00:54:30,243
I need time to prepare the cash.

568
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:34,543
Hey, aren't you going to
do business with me?

569
00:54:34,543 --> 00:54:35,810
Excuse me!

570
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:37,310
Comrade Ri Gak-su!

571
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:42,677
I'm listening, so
stop shouting.

572
00:54:42,677 --> 00:54:43,543
Geez...

573
00:54:44,143 --> 00:54:49,077
Do you know what the first thing
I learned in the Special Forces was?

574
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:50,310
How would I know that?

575
00:54:54,477 --> 00:54:55,577
Observation.

576
00:54:56,377 --> 00:55:02,143
Reading every detail to
understand the situation.

577
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:04,277
That's the key to survival.

578
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:18,877
Do you like her?

579
00:55:19,777 --> 00:55:22,410
It's not like that.

580
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:27,077
I did everything I could
to bring my wife here.

581
00:55:28,277 --> 00:55:31,877
But she died of
lung disease.

582
00:55:31,877 --> 00:55:34,543
If I'd known sooner...

583
00:55:34,543 --> 00:55:37,277
Fuck, I'm talking
my mouth off.

584
00:55:40,477 --> 00:55:42,577
You're old friends
with President Jang?

585
00:55:42,577 --> 00:55:45,277
He's trustworthy and loyal.

586
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:48,810
Woo-chul...

587
00:55:49,577 --> 00:55:53,077
Values can change
depending on the situation.

588
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:57,443
Are you interested in
working with me?

589
00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:11,410
You seemed to have
a fun chat with Gak-su.

590
00:56:13,143 --> 00:56:14,677
It was nothing.

591
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:18,543
Is it a secret?

592
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:22,210
He suggested
working with him.

593
00:56:25,110 --> 00:56:26,777
Just drive, you bastard.

594
00:56:26,777 --> 00:56:30,677
Do-sik, you should start
trusting Hyun-tae.

595
00:56:30,677 --> 00:56:32,377
We go way back.

596
00:56:33,277 --> 00:56:37,643
I guess Ri Gak-su has
taken a liking to you.

597
00:56:38,077 --> 00:56:40,343
That's why I'm
telling you everything.

598
00:56:41,143 --> 00:56:42,877
This is a good thing.

599
00:56:43,943 --> 00:56:46,177
Maybe you can
fool Gak-su.

600
00:56:46,177 --> 00:56:50,210
Let's use him to
handle Detective Cho.

601
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:54,310
We should get rid of that
bastard for good.

602
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:57,077
This is a good thing.

603
00:56:57,077 --> 00:56:59,143
Maybe you can
fool Gak-su.

604
00:56:59,143 --> 00:57:02,377
Let's use him to
handle Detective Cho...

605
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:04,177
Fuck...

606
00:57:04,777 --> 00:57:07,710
They all want to
screw me over.

607
00:57:16,043 --> 00:57:19,510
You've wasted your life,
Cho Jeong-gon.

608
00:57:22,977 --> 00:57:25,543
Gak-su, we have
a hitch in our plan.

609
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:27,577
I told you.

610
00:57:28,443 --> 00:57:30,510
He's become a sly fox.

611
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:34,210
We need Detective Cho
to round up Gak-su's gang.

612
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:38,043
They have more men
below the surface.

613
00:57:38,043 --> 00:57:40,010
Detective Cho
needs to raid them...

614
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:43,310
That's why I'm racking
my brain, idiot.

615
00:57:55,677 --> 00:58:01,877
So, if Song Woo-chul
approaches you...

616
00:58:02,477 --> 00:58:03,977
Be careful.

617
00:58:05,077 --> 00:58:07,910
It's going to be tricky.

618
00:58:09,543 --> 00:58:10,310
Why?

619
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:14,177
Are you scared of
his punches?

620
00:58:14,743 --> 00:58:16,043
No.

621
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:21,143
He knows when to fight
and when to stand down.

622
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:26,643
I need to be careful with
someone like him around.

623
00:58:28,743 --> 00:58:30,643
Let's just kill him, then.

624
00:58:30,643 --> 00:58:32,077
That would be a waste.

625
00:58:32,077 --> 00:58:34,977
What the fuck do you
want me to do, then?

626
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:40,777
Shit, our entire plan might fail.

627
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:44,143
Hold on.

628
00:58:45,477 --> 00:58:47,110
I'll take care of it.

629
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:48,943
I just remembered something.

630
00:59:04,243 --> 00:59:07,777
You son of a bitch.
You don't even flinch a bit.

631
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:12,177
Fuck, I came all the way here.

632
00:59:12,643 --> 00:59:15,177
Act surprised.

633
00:59:21,343 --> 00:59:22,610
Let's go for a drive.

634
00:59:25,243 --> 00:59:27,077
Kim Ji-hwan was
the favorite.

635
00:59:27,077 --> 00:59:30,577
But Do-sik bet a lot of
money on you.

636
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:32,877
You'll win, for sure!

637
00:59:32,877 --> 00:59:38,210
Do-sik did everything to settle
with the victim's family.

638
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:42,143
He wanted his body to be
cremated right away.

639
00:59:54,153 --> 00:59:55,920
Then, who's the killer?

640
00:59:57,777 --> 00:59:59,277
Song Woo-chul,
who punched him?

641
01:00:02,843 --> 01:00:03,910
Are you okay?

642
01:00:05,043 --> 01:00:08,210
Or Jang Do-sik,
who drugged him?

643
01:00:12,543 --> 01:00:17,010
I know everything.
Let's stop discussing it.

644
01:00:18,077 --> 01:00:19,243
What the fuck?

645
01:00:20,177 --> 01:00:21,877
You knew?

646
01:00:21,877 --> 01:00:23,943
You went to prison for him?

647
01:00:24,677 --> 01:00:25,677
For 7 years?

648
01:00:26,577 --> 01:00:28,277
Then, you must
know this as well.

649
01:00:30,177 --> 01:00:34,377
Ms. Choi Myung-joo
knows who you are.

650
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:46,443
I won't ask why
you need it.

651
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:48,977
Thank you, Madam.

652
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:56,477
You can't do drugs.

653
01:00:56,477 --> 01:00:57,543
That's not it.

654
01:00:58,210 --> 01:01:00,043
Then, why do you
need so much money?

655
01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:02,110
People always need money.

656
01:01:03,110 --> 01:01:05,077
Sometimes, people
even die for $5,000.

657
01:01:20,777 --> 01:01:23,610
Wow, that was fast.

658
01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:25,310
No wonder lots of
women work at bars.

659
01:01:26,977 --> 01:01:28,610
Sang-hwan, you
should go to school...

660
01:01:28,610 --> 01:01:30,143
I'm off, then.

661
01:01:30,677 --> 01:01:31,777
Let's keep in touch.

662
01:02:17,843 --> 01:02:18,943
Myung-joo...

663
01:02:24,243 --> 01:02:25,943
It's Bom, Director Song.

664
01:02:27,777 --> 01:02:28,910
Call me Bom.

665
01:02:30,977 --> 01:02:34,110
Why is everyone
spying on me?

666
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:47,343
I came because
I was worried!

667
01:02:48,577 --> 01:02:49,977
I was worried!

668
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:03,077
Give me your phone.

669
01:03:05,243 --> 01:03:06,643
Give it to me!

670
01:03:07,343 --> 01:03:09,343
I'm going to
delete my picture!

671
01:03:41,743 --> 01:03:42,943
Why?

672
01:03:42,943 --> 01:03:44,810
Are you worried you won't
get your fair share?

673
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:49,543
We should talk it over before
we move on with the plan.

674
01:03:52,310 --> 01:03:56,443
Woo-chul, you're
acting like a stranger.

675
01:03:58,177 --> 01:03:59,877
One more thing.

676
01:04:00,343 --> 01:04:02,043
What happens...

677
01:04:03,377 --> 01:04:05,810
If our plan fails?

678
01:04:05,810 --> 01:04:08,077
Don't jinx it.

679
01:04:08,077 --> 01:04:09,343
What's going on with you?

680
01:04:09,343 --> 01:04:13,243
Should I go to prison
for you again?

681
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:25,777
You're being
super weird today.

682
01:04:27,077 --> 01:04:32,077
Back then, you
volunteered to go.

683
01:04:32,777 --> 01:04:36,310
That's why I'm so thankful.

684
01:04:36,677 --> 01:04:39,677
Woo-chul,
to be frank...

685
01:04:39,677 --> 01:04:44,010
If it weren't for you and Detective Cho,
I wouldn't be doing this.

686
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:44,843
Is that so?

687
01:04:45,810 --> 01:04:46,710
Then...

688
01:04:47,743 --> 01:04:49,277
Maybe we should reconsider.

689
01:04:52,943 --> 01:04:57,943
And teach this dick
some manners.

690
01:05:11,077 --> 01:05:12,877
Son of a bitch.

691
01:05:13,443 --> 01:05:15,243
What are you waiting for?

692
01:05:15,243 --> 01:05:16,177
Strip down.

693
01:05:18,143 --> 01:05:20,510
Hurry up, bitch.
I'm busy.

694
01:05:33,277 --> 01:05:36,277
Why did Woo-chul
fall for you?

695
01:05:36,810 --> 01:05:38,310
Damn it...

696
01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:43,143
Oh, are you good at fucking?

697
01:05:43,143 --> 01:05:44,943
Come here, then.

698
01:05:45,977 --> 01:05:47,777
Suck my dick.

699
01:05:48,377 --> 01:05:50,810
- That's enough.
- I'm serious.

700
01:05:51,343 --> 01:05:52,177
Suck my dick.

701
01:05:52,843 --> 01:05:54,743
Bom, put your
clothes on and leave.

702
01:05:55,643 --> 01:05:57,510
You bitch.

703
01:05:57,510 --> 01:06:00,310
You fucking bitch.

704
01:06:00,310 --> 01:06:01,743
Are you disrespecting me, too?

705
01:06:01,743 --> 01:06:04,010
Fine, Han Su-jin.

706
01:06:04,010 --> 01:06:05,243
You strip down.

707
01:06:08,677 --> 01:06:10,010
Shall I, sir?

708
01:06:16,410 --> 01:06:17,310
Come here.

709
01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:20,877
Fucking bitch...

710
01:06:20,877 --> 01:06:23,800
Stay right there, bitch.

711
01:06:24,210 --> 01:06:25,910
Come over here.

712
01:06:25,910 --> 01:06:28,310
Step away,
and I'll kill you.

713
01:06:32,777 --> 01:06:35,310
Learn from your boss,
you stupid bitch.

714
01:06:39,377 --> 01:06:42,377
Harder, baby.

715
01:06:43,677 --> 01:06:45,110
Do me harder.

716
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:47,010
More.

717
01:06:47,943 --> 01:06:48,977
More.

718
01:06:51,243 --> 01:06:52,377
Jang Do-sik.

719
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:56,210
Shit...

720
01:06:57,643 --> 01:06:58,843
Is that all you've got?

721
01:07:19,077 --> 01:07:24,877
Let's see what those
bastards are planning...

722
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:28,177
What the fuck?

723
01:07:38,810 --> 01:07:41,377
That bitch ruined
my plan again.

724
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:46,110
Fuck!

725
01:07:47,577 --> 01:07:48,743
Get in here.

726
01:07:49,443 --> 01:07:50,510
Get off of me!

727
01:07:50,710 --> 01:07:53,577
- You brat...
- What's going on?

728
01:07:53,577 --> 01:07:57,210
He lost his money gambling,
so he pulled out a knife.

729
01:07:57,210 --> 01:07:59,543
You can't hit me just
because you're the police!

730
01:07:59,543 --> 01:08:02,877
If it weren't for me, the thugs
would have killed you.

731
01:08:02,877 --> 01:08:05,377
- Let me go!
- Wait, Detective Kim.

732
01:08:05,377 --> 01:08:06,110
Yes, sir?

733
01:08:07,510 --> 01:08:09,443
I'll handle this.

734
01:08:10,077 --> 01:08:11,377
Yes, sir.

735
01:08:32,543 --> 01:08:33,810
You trust Woo-chul, right?

736
01:08:36,043 --> 01:08:36,877
Don't you?

737
01:08:38,910 --> 01:08:39,843
Yes...

738
01:08:41,210 --> 01:08:42,977
- I trust him.
- Good answer.

739
01:08:42,977 --> 01:08:44,577
I trust him, too.

740
01:08:45,577 --> 01:08:48,510
So, you have nothing to lose.

741
01:08:48,510 --> 01:08:50,877
He would never betray us.

742
01:08:51,843 --> 01:08:52,777
Right?

743
01:08:57,543 --> 01:09:00,477
Don't just nod your head,
you rude bastard.

744
01:09:01,443 --> 01:09:02,377
Yes, sir.

745
01:09:03,477 --> 01:09:07,310
Check what's going on
and report to me, okay?

746
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:08,143
Yes, sir.

747
01:09:09,077 --> 01:09:10,843
Hyun-tae, come here.

748
01:09:12,677 --> 01:09:14,943
Come closer, idiot.

749
01:09:16,610 --> 01:09:21,743
Hyun-tae, I'm not
like Woo-chul.

750
01:09:22,443 --> 01:09:23,343
You know that, right?

751
01:09:23,343 --> 01:09:27,443
Bitch, have you forgotten
what my brother did for you?

752
01:09:27,443 --> 01:09:29,510
He treated you well!

753
01:09:29,510 --> 01:09:33,543
He treated you so well,
you fucking bitch!

754
01:09:33,543 --> 01:09:35,810
Shit, what has
this world come to?

755
01:09:35,810 --> 01:09:38,310
She's dating the guy
that killed your brother!

756
01:09:38,310 --> 01:09:42,210
It's all Choi Myung-joo's fault!

757
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:45,210
Die, you fucking bitch!

758
01:10:43,843 --> 01:10:44,843
It's okay.

759
01:10:45,977 --> 01:10:49,710
I'll make everything okay.

760
01:12:11,810 --> 01:12:14,043
That bastard doesn't
even get seasick.

761
01:12:19,643 --> 01:12:22,577
Don't look at me
so hatefully.

762
01:12:23,443 --> 01:12:27,510
We need Cho Jeong-gon for
everything to go smoothly.

763
01:12:27,977 --> 01:12:32,010
You must be prepared to kill
in order to save someone.

764
01:12:32,710 --> 01:12:36,577
That's why being
a human being is so hard.

765
01:12:39,943 --> 01:12:42,343
Yang-gi, turn the boat around!

766
01:13:04,677 --> 01:13:07,477
Just act natural.

767
01:13:08,343 --> 01:13:10,510
As if nothing happened.

768
01:13:11,277 --> 01:13:13,210
Go to work, as usual.

769
01:13:15,577 --> 01:13:16,743
Do you understand?

770
01:13:17,577 --> 01:13:19,610
If anything happens, call me.

771
01:13:28,410 --> 01:13:29,677
Don't go.

772
01:13:36,477 --> 01:13:37,843
Please.

773
01:13:39,310 --> 01:13:40,510
Don't go.

774
01:13:46,677 --> 01:13:48,777
Myung-joo, everything
will be fine.

775
01:13:49,877 --> 01:13:51,210
It's okay.

776
01:13:52,043 --> 01:13:53,610
I'm fine.

777
01:13:57,277 --> 01:13:59,110
So, don't go.

778
01:14:13,410 --> 01:14:18,343
This is the safest place
to have a secret chat.

779
01:14:19,477 --> 01:14:24,343
It's good for threatening
someone, as well.

780
01:14:24,343 --> 01:14:25,510
Get to the point.

781
01:14:25,943 --> 01:14:27,143
Well...

782
01:14:30,043 --> 01:14:32,243
I've been thinking.

783
01:14:32,243 --> 01:14:35,477
Who will do their
absolute best for me?

784
01:14:35,477 --> 01:14:37,643
Ri Gak-su?
No way.

785
01:14:38,210 --> 01:14:39,377
Jang Do-sik?

786
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:41,877
He can fuck off.

787
01:14:46,010 --> 01:14:46,843
You.

788
01:14:48,743 --> 01:14:51,443
It's you, you bastard.

789
01:14:53,843 --> 01:14:56,410
They have multiple options.

790
01:14:57,543 --> 01:14:59,143
But you only have one.

791
01:15:00,110 --> 01:15:03,943
Choi Myung-joo,
the murder suspect.

792
01:15:03,943 --> 01:15:06,410
You're responsible for it, too.

793
01:15:12,010 --> 01:15:14,843
So? So what?

794
01:15:14,843 --> 01:15:19,010
Do you want to
fight me, head on?

795
01:15:20,977 --> 01:15:22,710
You're desperate.

796
01:15:24,277 --> 01:15:25,177
I'm not.

797
01:15:27,610 --> 01:15:29,243
The night of May 2nd.

798
01:15:30,010 --> 01:15:33,277
I don't care who
lives or dies.

799
01:15:33,277 --> 01:15:34,910
I just want the money.

800
01:15:37,610 --> 01:15:40,810
Get me the money.

801
01:15:41,443 --> 01:15:48,310
Then, you and Bom can
do whatever you want.

802
01:15:49,010 --> 01:15:49,877
Okay?

803
01:15:53,577 --> 01:15:56,677
Good luck, buddy.

804
01:15:57,610 --> 01:15:58,410
Come on.

805
01:15:59,577 --> 01:16:01,510
Fuck...

806
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:04,543
After this is over,
soften your edges.

807
01:16:04,843 --> 01:16:07,143
Otherwise, Bom
won't love you.

808
01:16:08,043 --> 01:16:09,210
Oh, right.

809
01:16:09,677 --> 01:16:13,010
The night before, Choi Myung-joo
will be brought to the station.

810
01:16:14,177 --> 01:16:16,077
You fucking idiot.

811
01:16:16,577 --> 01:16:18,310
I told you.

812
01:16:19,210 --> 01:16:21,543
This is the safest
place in the world.

813
01:16:22,643 --> 01:16:26,343
But it might become hell.

814
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:32,243
Get up here.
Let's have a match.

815
01:16:43,743 --> 01:16:45,210
Fuck it...

816
01:16:53,410 --> 01:16:54,977
You're not wearing
a mouth guard.

817
01:16:54,977 --> 01:16:56,477
Are you going easy on me?

818
01:16:56,477 --> 01:16:58,910
That really hurts my ego.

819
01:16:58,910 --> 01:17:00,910
Don't go easy on me,
you bastard!

820
01:17:25,710 --> 01:17:27,543
Fuck...

821
01:17:39,843 --> 01:17:40,777
Hey.

822
01:17:41,710 --> 01:17:43,910
I don't owe you
anything anymore.

823
01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:49,943
What went wrong
between us?

824
01:17:50,777 --> 01:17:52,010
Woo-chul...

825
01:17:54,110 --> 01:17:55,543
Are we still friends?

826
01:18:02,477 --> 01:18:03,577
Are we not?

827
01:18:07,210 --> 01:18:08,510
Answer me.

828
01:18:09,343 --> 01:18:10,510
Are we friends or not?

829
01:18:19,043 --> 01:18:20,043
Hey!

830
01:18:26,677 --> 01:18:32,677
I'll start thinking of this
as business, then.

831
01:18:35,310 --> 01:18:37,077
The world keeps spinning.

832
01:18:38,043 --> 01:18:40,277
We all have jobs to do.

833
01:18:40,277 --> 01:18:41,343
Right?

834
01:18:42,577 --> 01:18:44,077
Director Song Woo-chul?

835
01:18:57,677 --> 01:19:00,943
You trust me, right?

836
01:19:17,277 --> 01:19:19,110
Better the devil you know.

837
01:19:21,210 --> 01:19:23,510
We know each
other's goals.

838
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:26,677
Let's talk business,
and make it win-win.

839
01:19:28,543 --> 01:19:30,110
Hmm...

840
01:19:32,910 --> 01:19:34,243
There we go.

841
01:19:35,377 --> 01:19:37,143
What do you think, buddy?

842
01:19:38,610 --> 01:19:40,510
You don't care who
you work with, right?

843
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:45,943
We don't trust each other,
so let's make a detailed plan.

844
01:19:45,943 --> 01:19:47,443
Detective Cho.

845
01:19:49,377 --> 01:19:50,510
Director Song.

846
01:19:54,710 --> 01:19:56,377
Think you can fool Gak-su?

847
01:20:04,543 --> 01:20:10,143
I'll give you the locations, ledgers
and bonds of Do-sik's gang.

848
01:20:10,543 --> 01:20:16,143
The moment they get the drugs,
Do-sik's men will attack you.

849
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:20,130
If you attack them first...

850
01:20:20,922 --> 01:20:24,422
They'll all go down
in a single night.

851
01:20:26,710 --> 01:20:30,043
In return, you want
a safe boat trip for two?

852
01:20:32,077 --> 01:20:33,710
With some cash?

853
01:20:36,477 --> 01:20:41,110
What do I get,
besides money?

854
01:20:41,610 --> 01:20:46,077
I'll make sure she's safe,
then return to you.

855
01:20:46,477 --> 01:20:48,810
Are you sure about this?

856
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:50,043
Don't worry.

857
01:20:52,110 --> 01:20:54,543
All right, it's a deal.

858
01:20:54,543 --> 01:20:56,710
Get everyone ready
before the boat arrives.

859
01:20:56,710 --> 01:20:58,643
Stay quiet, okay?

860
01:20:58,643 --> 01:20:59,210
Yes, boss.

861
01:21:01,377 --> 01:21:02,943
Detective Cho.

862
01:21:02,943 --> 01:21:05,543
Get the police on the scene
at the right moment.

863
01:21:06,443 --> 01:21:08,877
Catch all of them, okay?

864
01:21:09,743 --> 01:21:11,910
As soon as I get my money.

865
01:21:13,210 --> 01:21:17,110
Who came up with this plan?

866
01:21:17,510 --> 01:21:19,010
I don't think it was you.

867
01:21:26,577 --> 01:21:30,577
Just find out where
Ri Gak-su docks his boat.

868
01:21:31,310 --> 01:21:35,743
Just get me the money.

869
01:21:35,743 --> 01:21:38,143
Cho Jeong-gon will
get the money.

870
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:39,943
I'll get the drugs.

871
01:21:39,943 --> 01:21:41,877
You'll get to leave
with the girl.

872
01:21:41,877 --> 01:21:45,310
In return, you want
a safe boat trip for two?

873
01:21:45,310 --> 01:21:47,577
Fuck, how reasonable!

874
01:21:48,810 --> 01:21:50,077
You have to come.

875
01:21:53,010 --> 01:21:54,043
Promise.

876
01:22:00,310 --> 01:22:01,743
I promise.

877
01:22:31,077 --> 01:22:34,377
If I'm not there by 4,
leave without me.

878
01:22:34,377 --> 01:22:40,043
Even if you get a call from
my number, don't answer.

879
01:22:49,043 --> 01:22:50,510
I'm sorry, Hyun-tae.

880
01:22:51,077 --> 01:22:52,910
You shouldn't be
involved in all this.

881
01:22:57,443 --> 01:22:58,510
I'll see you later.

882
01:23:26,010 --> 01:23:27,077
Good luck.

883
01:23:28,943 --> 01:23:31,043
'The Wild'
Song Woo-chul.

884
01:23:31,043 --> 01:23:32,943
3 against 1 is
easy for you.

885
01:23:32,943 --> 01:23:34,410
Don't lose focus.

886
01:23:35,777 --> 01:23:37,710
Otherwise, you won't get
to see your girlfriend.

887
01:23:51,177 --> 01:23:57,343
It doesn't take much for
friends to become foes.

888
01:23:57,530 --> 01:23:58,897
Fuck...

889
01:24:29,110 --> 01:24:30,443
Let's see...

890
01:24:32,410 --> 01:24:34,977
Sawasdee krap.

891
01:24:34,977 --> 01:24:36,710
Kop khun krap.

892
01:24:37,843 --> 01:24:39,143
Fuck...

893
01:25:32,243 --> 01:25:33,777
Where's your girlfriend?

894
01:25:53,277 --> 01:25:55,077
Hurry up, Woo-chul.

895
01:26:21,443 --> 01:26:22,943
Shit, that must hurt.

896
01:26:37,143 --> 01:26:38,110
Damn...

897
01:26:55,010 --> 01:26:58,177
Song Woo-chul, you're
still a hell of a fighter.

898
01:27:07,510 --> 01:27:08,843
You got the text, right?

899
01:27:09,810 --> 01:27:12,777
That place must be
familiar to you.

900
01:27:12,777 --> 01:27:14,243
Good job.

901
01:27:15,043 --> 01:27:15,977
Woo-chul...

902
01:27:17,210 --> 01:27:18,077
Goodbye.

903
01:27:21,577 --> 01:27:22,677
Is everyone there?

904
01:27:23,843 --> 01:27:25,577
- Yes, boss.
- And the other matter?

905
01:27:25,577 --> 01:27:26,677
It's all set.

906
01:27:30,877 --> 01:27:31,777
Let's go.

907
01:27:50,577 --> 01:27:52,777
Open it.

908
01:28:03,443 --> 01:28:06,043
You skilled son of a bitch.

909
01:28:06,943 --> 01:28:08,877
Hey, hey...

910
01:28:08,877 --> 01:28:13,643
Fine, fine.
I'll handle it.

911
01:28:17,243 --> 01:28:18,343
Yes, sir?

912
01:28:18,343 --> 01:28:19,443
Detective Kim.

913
01:28:20,110 --> 01:28:24,243
Let Choi Myung-joo go.
She's innocent.

914
01:28:24,477 --> 01:28:27,343
Yes, sir...

915
01:28:27,343 --> 01:28:30,977
I was tipped off
about something.

916
01:28:55,643 --> 01:28:56,510
Shit.

917
01:28:58,477 --> 01:28:59,510
Buddy...

918
01:29:06,077 --> 01:29:07,377
You want to kill me?

919
01:29:07,977 --> 01:29:11,177
Should I do it myself?

920
01:29:20,277 --> 01:29:23,810
Damn it, I was
aiming for your dick.

921
01:29:25,810 --> 01:29:27,210
Fucking bastard.

922
01:29:29,043 --> 01:29:29,843
Hey...

923
01:29:31,010 --> 01:29:33,843
I really want to kill you.

924
01:29:33,843 --> 01:29:37,543
But you let me
quit being a detective,

925
01:29:37,543 --> 01:29:40,943
so maybe
I should let you live.

926
01:29:40,943 --> 01:29:42,643
No, I should kill you.

927
01:29:42,643 --> 01:29:44,143
You son of a bitch.

928
01:29:44,143 --> 01:29:47,410
Do you want to live?

929
01:29:47,410 --> 01:29:49,543
I'll die, then.

930
01:29:56,377 --> 01:29:59,910
Do you want to die or live?

931
01:29:59,910 --> 01:30:00,943
Look at me.

932
01:30:00,943 --> 01:30:02,110
Come on, fucker.

933
01:30:38,843 --> 01:30:40,843
Detective Cho isn't
answering his phone.

934
01:30:40,843 --> 01:30:44,310
- Are the police on their way?
- Yes, they are.

935
01:30:44,743 --> 01:30:47,543
Okay, okay...

936
01:30:48,877 --> 01:30:53,477
Woo-chul is giving me
a big farewell gift.

937
01:31:07,810 --> 01:31:10,677
We have to go, right?

938
01:31:12,377 --> 01:31:16,143
Let's wait just
a little bit more.

939
01:31:20,543 --> 01:31:23,510
- Thanks, Hyun-tae.
- Don't mention it.

940
01:31:23,510 --> 01:31:26,577
Woo-chul must be
a really good person.

941
01:31:28,110 --> 01:31:30,710
He has a loyal
friend like you.

942
01:31:31,410 --> 01:31:32,277
Yeah.

943
01:31:34,077 --> 01:31:35,543
He's great.

944
01:31:47,277 --> 01:31:48,610
Damn it...

945
01:31:49,443 --> 01:31:50,277
Check everywhere.

946
01:32:01,943 --> 01:32:03,243
Are you okay?

947
01:32:03,910 --> 01:32:06,643
Hyun-tae, thanks for waiting.

948
01:32:09,410 --> 01:32:10,143
Where's Myung-joo?

949
01:32:10,610 --> 01:32:12,710
I dropped her off
somewhere safe.

950
01:32:16,177 --> 01:32:17,510
Where's the money
and the drugs?

951
01:32:18,043 --> 01:32:20,010
We should hurry.

952
01:32:20,010 --> 01:32:21,710
Myung-joo is
waiting for you.

953
01:32:56,743 --> 01:32:59,710
Hey, President Jang!

954
01:33:01,577 --> 01:33:04,510
What's that bastard
doing here?

955
01:33:05,343 --> 01:33:06,643
Going somewhere?

956
01:33:18,410 --> 01:33:21,343
When will you bring
your wife from the North?

957
01:33:36,177 --> 01:33:41,777
This knife kept me safe
even before I left my hometown.

958
01:33:44,277 --> 01:33:45,277
Take it.

959
01:33:50,510 --> 01:33:53,043
Is Jang Do-sik gone?

960
01:33:53,910 --> 01:33:54,910
Yes, he is.

961
01:33:58,843 --> 01:34:00,477
I have to do
all kinds of shit.

962
01:34:01,043 --> 01:34:03,310
I was afraid I might
kill Song Woo-chul.

963
01:34:29,543 --> 01:34:30,910
I'm so sorry.

964
01:34:35,543 --> 01:34:37,343
He took Ye-ri.

965
01:34:40,443 --> 01:34:44,343
Jang Do-sik might
kill her for real.

966
01:35:19,077 --> 01:35:20,610
I need to save her.

967
01:35:21,710 --> 01:35:23,943
I'm all she has.

968
01:35:25,843 --> 01:35:27,910
Shit...

969
01:35:27,910 --> 01:35:31,843
You should have gotten on
the fishing boat and left!

970
01:36:12,310 --> 01:36:13,743
What the fuck!

971
01:36:19,477 --> 01:36:23,043
You're out of your mind.

972
01:36:33,610 --> 01:36:35,477
Stupid bastard.

973
01:36:46,610 --> 01:36:51,310
A dog never
abandons his owner.

974
01:36:51,310 --> 01:36:55,710
It's always the owner
who abandons his dog.

975
01:37:02,343 --> 01:37:04,210
What happened to Woo-chul?

976
01:37:06,277 --> 01:37:07,243
Huh?

977
01:37:21,943 --> 01:37:23,110
You're right.

978
01:37:26,177 --> 01:37:27,910
I should have
listened to you.

979
01:37:29,043 --> 01:37:30,243
I'm sorry.

980
01:37:32,177 --> 01:37:33,410
Just...

981
01:37:36,610 --> 01:37:38,610
Don't kill Myung-joo.

982
01:37:41,343 --> 01:37:44,643
She's got nothing
to do with me.

983
01:37:47,910 --> 01:37:49,243
Let her live.

984
01:37:51,477 --> 01:37:52,477
Please.

985
01:37:53,743 --> 01:37:55,643
Promise me that.

986
01:37:59,143 --> 01:38:00,143
Thanks.

987
01:38:01,910 --> 01:38:05,043
Hyun-tae, you're
a good person.

988
01:38:05,043 --> 01:38:07,110
I know I can trust you.

989
01:38:09,210 --> 01:38:12,343
You trust me, right?

990
01:38:12,343 --> 01:38:13,877
You're dating one
of the girls, too.

991
01:38:17,777 --> 01:38:19,743
Ta-da!
I decorated it myself.

992
01:38:26,077 --> 01:38:27,243
I'm sorry...

993
01:38:28,143 --> 01:38:29,043
It's okay.

994
01:38:31,210 --> 01:38:32,077
It's okay.

995
01:41:19,310 --> 01:41:24,143
Go to sleep, baby

996
01:41:25,377 --> 01:41:30,077
Please don't crow, roosters

997
01:41:31,310 --> 01:41:36,043
Please don't bark, doggies

998
01:41:58,843 --> 01:41:59,977
What happened to Hyun-tae?

999
01:42:03,677 --> 01:42:07,177
I got the money
and the drugs.

1000
01:42:12,577 --> 01:42:15,210
People who go
crazy over money

1001
01:42:16,010 --> 01:42:18,243
are doomed to live
a short life.

1002
01:42:37,277 --> 01:42:39,310
Has everything been
taken care of?

1003
01:42:43,210 --> 01:42:44,610
Not yet, boss.

1004
01:42:53,777 --> 01:42:55,243
Bastard...

1005
01:43:03,543 --> 01:43:05,143
Look into my eyes.

1006
01:43:05,577 --> 01:43:07,310
Don't pretend you're sorry.

1007
01:43:14,110 --> 01:43:17,010
You've learned
a lot, Yoon-jae.

1008
01:43:18,110 --> 01:43:21,843
Not letting others predict your move.

1009
01:43:21,843 --> 01:43:23,277
But fuck...

1010
01:43:25,543 --> 01:43:29,077
This really hurts my feelings,
you son of a bitch.

1011
01:43:55,243 --> 01:43:58,310
Ready?
Let's get to work.

1012
01:43:58,310 --> 01:43:59,743
Yes, Madam!

1013
01:44:07,977 --> 01:44:09,877
Shall we talk business?

1014
01:44:26,210 --> 01:44:28,910
This is for Woo-chul.

1015
01:44:46,277 --> 01:44:50,143
Go to sleep, baby

1016
01:44:50,143 --> 01:44:54,043
Please don't crow, roosters

1017
01:44:54,043 --> 01:44:57,910
Please don't bark, doggies

1018
01:44:59,710 --> 01:45:01,710
Baby, you're home.
