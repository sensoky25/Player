1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000


2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000


3
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:52,166
Run, I'm going to catch you.
No, don't go in there.

4
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,416
Your mother is going to kill us.
Come on, drop it.

5
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,666
- I'm going to catch you!
- I don't want to go to sleep.

6
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,458
Hey! Come on, to bed now.

7
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:02,166
The Three Kings are going to come
and catch you still awake.

8
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,833
No, I'm not sleepy.

9
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:06,250
Yes! Buddy,
your aunt and I have to go home.

10
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:08,250
Good night.

11
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:10,958
Uncle, can I see Lúculo?

12
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:15,791
- All right, but only for a minute, okay?
- Okay.

13
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,833
Come on, and then go to sleep.

14
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:22,958
Look here, press the button to call him.

15
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,708
Lúculo! Lúculo!

16
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:28,833
Look, he's coming to see you...

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,958
Do you see him? Here?

18
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:32,250
Can I feed him?

19
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:34,625
Do you want him
to swell up like a balloon?

20
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,583
To not be able to move,
to get chubby like you?

21
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:39,500
- I'm not chubby.
- Aren't you?

22
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:41,666
He'll never be able to move again.

23
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,625
Come on, off to bed,
before your mother gets back.

24
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,541
Come on, Uncle! Five more minutes!

25
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:49,166
I'll wait up for you.

26
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,708
As long as you're here tomorrow
to open the presents.

27
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:54,791
Little brother...

28
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:05,583
It was difficult, but it looks like
he's finally asleep.

29
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,583
In two hours, he'll be in my room,

30
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:10,458
asking me if the Three Kings have come,
you'll see.

31
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,208
You're sure you don't want
to stay a little longer?

32
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:17,375
No, no, no, no, no.
Better get home before traffic gets bad.

33
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:21,333
Sorry you didn't get to see Mario.
He's still at the station.

34
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:24,666
It's okay. Tell him
he's still my favorite brother-in-law.

35
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:25,625
All right.

36
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,500
- Okay, guys. Thanks for coming. Bye.
- All right. Bye Belén.

37
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:31,041
Bye.

38
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:32,041
We'll talk, okay?

39
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:33,750
- Okay, I love you.
- I love you, too.

40
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:35,458
- Be careful, okay?
- Yes.

41
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:03,958
Are you going to tell me?

42
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:07,958
- Júlia?
- You know what's wrong.

43
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:10,500
Stop it.

44
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:15,083
- This isn't the right time.
- When is the right time?

45
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:20,125
If you don't want kids, just tell me.
Stop messing with me, please.

46
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:21,750
Júlia, please.

47
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:24,500
I'm tired of feeling like
you're stringing me along, my love.

48
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:27,875
You tell me you don't know
if you're going to be a good father.

49
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,125
That I won't be able to handle it.

50
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,291
- You keep giving excuses...
- Watch out!

51
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,750
Are you okay?

52
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,666
Yeah, yeah. You?

53
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,666
ONE YEAR LATER...

54
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,583
So, we continue to await the result

55
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:39,291
of the special meeting
of the Council of the European Union

56
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:42,291
where the possibility of border closures
is being debated.

57
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,291
I'm not sure how you all view the issue.

58
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:47,708
We should be prudent and wait
to see what the experts say.

59
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,083
Excuse me for a second,

60
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,791
because we are connecting with
Daniel Romero...

61
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,166
THE TSJ VIRUS SPREADS:
EUROPE CLOSES BORDERS WITH RUSSIA

62
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,416
...security expert. He's advising the EU,

63
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,583
specifically, the Directorate-General
for Safety and Public Health.

64
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:05,208
Good morning, Daniel. A complicated day
in Brussels today, I understand?

65
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:08,583
Good morning, Antonio.
Well, yes, very, very difficult days.

66
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:14,000
For hours, we've been receiving
very difficult images from the borders.

67
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,708
You've all seen them.

68
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:19,083
There are rumors that they intend to adopt
a border closure policy

69
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:22,666
similar to the one currently
being debated in the European Union.

70
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:27,666
How likely is it that we'll see
border closures globally?

71
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,125
Very likely.

72
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:33,541
We're seeing that the incidence of
the TSJ virus is absolutely devastating,

73
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:37,416
with a total failure of
prevention measures so far.

74
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,791
Considering what we saw
during the Covid-19 pandemic,

75
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,666
I believe we're only a few days away
from more drastic measures.

76
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,458
Guidelines are being considered for...

77
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,666
Deputy González Escalón,
welcome to the program.

78
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,750
Thank you.

79
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,625
You can probably guess
my first question,

80
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:13,708
why does your party distance itself
from the bioweapon theory?

81
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,333
We don't understand why

82
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,916
the natural origin theory
has been revived so quickly.

83
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,750
So, I understand that you don't believe
the United Nations report...

84
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,291
WELCOME TO THE BEGINNING
OF THE END

85
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:27,166
...that places the origin in
abandoned labs from the Soviet Union.

86
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,375
That report has
a number of glaring errors.

87
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:30,958
Errors, like...

88
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:34,208
Okay, well, for example, it talks
about three abandoned laboratories...

89
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,583
- Combarro.
- What?

90
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,916
- Combarro.
- I think it's him.

91
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,583
You're selling the Corinto?

92
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:47,791
Pleasure to meet you. This is María.

93
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:48,791
Pleasure to meet you.

94
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:49,708
Hi.

95
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,958
Where's the boat?
Can't wait to see it.

96
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,250
- Right over here.
- Here?

97
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:58,208
I think everything was in the ad.
It's nine meters long,

98
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,416
the engine has
a little over 2000 hours on it,

99
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,166
but it's up to date with servicing.

100
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,958
FOR SALE

101
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,208
Yeah?

102
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:12,291
The sails haven't been used in a year,
but they're in perfect condition.

103
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,041
Thank you.

104
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,208
Thank you.

105
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,750
Do you have any invoices?

106
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,583
Yes, I think so.

107
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,541
Check it out, inside it has...

108
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,250
Does it or does it not suit me perfectly?

109
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,750
It doesn't suit you.

110
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,833
- What do you mean? Look at me.
- No, I don't like it.

111
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:56,208
- But it's exactly my size.
- Actually, I want to take it off.

112
00:07:57,041 --> 00:08:00,583
Love... I'm stuck!

113
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:04,000
- It's my favorite bracelet. Careful.
- Okay, okay, don't worry.

114
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,125
- Don't worry.
- Okay. Now.

115
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,500
- I'm sorry.
- No, you broke it.

116
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,625
You broke it, handsome.

117
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,041
I'm sorry.

118
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:18,083
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

119
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,833
Dear customers, we are opening
two additional cash registers.

120
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:43,208
In order to facilitate your shopping,
our new hours will be from...

121
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:56,875
Dear customers,
we are working to restock all shelves

122
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,291
as quickly as possible.

123
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:01,625
We remind you that the government
recommends that you not purchase

124
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,958
more than two unit of each product.
Thank you very much.

125
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,041
Good evening to you all.

126
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:17,208
To explain the situation we're facing,

127
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:20,333
joining me is the head of the Ministry
of Health, Fernando Aguirre.

128
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:22,291
Thank you, Mr. President.

129
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:25,750
First of all,
we wanted to inform you that yesterday,

130
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:29,833
the government of La Rioja
contained two cases in the town of Haro.

131
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,791
Also, the government
of the Balearic Islands has informed us

132
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,916
that no cases have been registered

133
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,416
since the incidents at Cala Ratjada
and Inca, both in Mallorca.

134
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:41,958
Come here. Easy, relax.

135
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,208
These two news items tell us
that right now,

136
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,166
all cases are controlled in Spain,

137
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:50,791
which is to say,
we are containing the disease.

138
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,750
Lúculo! Lúculo!

139
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,208
Where's Lúculo?

140
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:18,250
Please leave Lúculo alone.
I have to talk to your uncle.

141
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,041
Mario, please. Take him.

142
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,708
- Go on.
- I want to see Lúculo.

143
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:24,708
- Let's go.
- Not, but I want to see Lúculo.

144
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,958
- Where's Lúculo?
- There we go.

145
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,958
- What's up?
- I called you a bunch of times.

146
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,666
I was showing the boat to a couple.

147
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,541
Tell me you sold it
and they paid a lot of money.

148
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:39,416
They were looking for something
a little more modern.

149
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:46,541
Listen. I have a proposition, okay?
Just a moment.

150
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,500
This morning they called Mario.

151
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,541
They're transferring us
to the Canary Islands

152
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,125
while all this is going on.

153
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:01,083
He thinks it's to check
information systems,

154
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,000
but they haven't told him anything more.

155
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,208
And when do you leave?

156
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,875
Well, tonight.

157
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,750
And they notified you today?

158
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,541
Listen. Why don't you come with us?

159
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:16,375
- They're giving us a house.
- I can't. I'm sorry, Belén.

160
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:20,208
Yes, you can. I checked.
There's a flight tomorrow from Vigo.

161
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:26,541
- You're not going to be left alone.
- No, I'll be okay.

162
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,666
Come for a few days at least, okay?

163
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,000
Wait for everything to calm down
and then if you want to go back,

164
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,375
- you can grab--
- Belén, please, don't insist.

165
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:38,083
Imagine we're confined,
like with COVID,

166
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,250
and you're there alone, stranded...

167
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,791
Well, I'm with Lúculo.

168
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,958
Okay. Do it for me.

169
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,916
Do it for me, please.

170
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:18,541
Come on.
It's only going to be a few days.

171
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:31,583
Multiple sources are
now confirming alarming news,

172
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,541
the emergence of a new variant
of the TSJ virus,

173
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:39,166
which has put European authorities
in a tight spot these last 24 hours.

174
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,791
This mutation,
still without an official name,

175
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,166
seems to redefine what we know
about the virus.

176
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:48,250
It drastically shortens the
incubation period to only a few minutes

177
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:51,708
from the moment of contagion
to the appearance of severe symptoms.

178
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:52,791
FORGIVE US LORD

179
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,625
The mode of transmission may be
through contact with blood,

180
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,750
especially caused by subcutaneous
wounds and bites,

181
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,541
ruling out airborne transmission
as a means of infection.

182
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,208
Thanks. No.

183
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,458
Passengers on flight KTV043D
to Barcelona,

184
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,833

185
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,333
Your first flight.

186
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,500
Are you nervous?

187
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:28,750
Passengers on flight VTL290J

188
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,666

189
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:41,250

Yes. Through here.

193
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,791
BARCELONA

194
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:54,916

00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,916
Hi.

196
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,000
- Perfect. Have a nice trip.
- Thank you.

197
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,583
Hello. How are you?

198
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:10,208
Wait over here.
Come this way. Go ahead.

199
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:14,291
I'm boarding now. I'll let you know
when I've landed, okay? Bye.

200
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,166
Thank you. Have a nice trip.

201
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,625
I don't know what's happening.

202
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:24,208
- Could you step aside one moment?
- What's this about? Why?

203
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,291
We'll figure this out, okay?

204
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,125
One moment, please. We don't...

205
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,416
Okay.

206
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:34,708
Could you stand there with the gentleman?
One moment.

207
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,083
- Don't worry. I'm asking you...
- No, no. I'm already getting agitated.

208
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,250
CANCELLED

209
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,250
I'm asking you for a little patience.

210
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,333
GRAN CANARIA
CANCELLED

211
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,833
Okay. A little bit of patience, please.

212
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,208
We're trying to find out
what's happening.

213
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,291
CANCELLED

214
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,833
- We'll give you an explanation.
- There aren't any flights?

215
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:57,416
Please, a little patience.
We're going to look into what's happening.

216
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,833
- We don't know. Calm down, please.
- How do you not know?

217
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,041
You know perfectly well.

218
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,375
- I don't know.
- You're lying.

219
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:03,916
Please, sir, calm down.

220
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,666
They're messing with us. They want...
They want us all to die here.

221
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,000
CIVIL SECURITY ALERT
TEMPORARY STATE OF ALERT

222
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:24,250
Sir, return to your place.
Sir, return to your place.

223
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:27,000
I want to get onto that plane! Let me go!

224
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,416
Security!

225
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,500
- Yeah?
- Listen, they're closing the airspace.

226
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,250
Yeah, they're announcing it now.

227
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:46,083
There's a variant
with a few minutes' incubation.

228
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:49,625
Go home and lock yourself in
until we know more, okay?

229
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:50,875
Okay.

230
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,833
- Clear out! Let's go!
- Clear out!

231
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,833
Freeze! Drop the weapon!

232
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,750
Drop the weapon! Now!

233
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,833
News of the state of emergency
has be accompanied by incidents

234
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:15,041
like the one at Vigo Airport
where a man has been arrested

235
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:18,000
after stealing a gun and
threatening security personnel,

236
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:21,625
as well as the disturbances we've been
seeing in various locations.

237
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:24,708
Meanwhile, we continue to wait
for the president's appearance,

238
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,416
where it is expected he will explain

239
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,333
whether the sudden declaration of
a state of emergency

240
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:33,583
is related to the possible occurrence
of the new variant in Spain,

241
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:36,333
and whether there will be
any last-minute directive...

242
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:37,791
6,4 KM TO PONTEVEDRA

243
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:40,750
...regarding the restriction of movement
due to the new situation.

244
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,250
We return now to Galicia,

245
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:46,125
where the regional government's Department
of Infrastructure and Transportation

246
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,458
reports heavy traffic
on all road networks.

247
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,791
The Ferrol-Villalba Highway may be
experiencing a backup

248
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:56,333
of several kilometers as it passes
through Puentes de García Rodríguez.

249
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:59,958
Indeed, all highways are showing
significant backups.

250
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:02,541
We recommend finding alternatives
for your travels.

251
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,500
24/7 News, Galicia.

252
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:10,250
Concern among the residents of Santiago
over the soldiers who deserted...

253
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,625
Hey, do you need something?

254
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,291
We have to get to Chantada.
My husband's family is there.

255
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,166
Well, honestly,
I think the best thing is to turn around.

256
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,500
What?

257
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:27,416
The best thing is to turn around
while you can.

258
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:30,291
Because we're not going to be able
to continue this way.

259
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,333
- Okay. Thanks.
- Thanks.

260
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:36,166
...tried to take by force
a Maritime Rescue vessel

261
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,750
that was providing them food and water.

262
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:42,000
To these various disturbances
we have to now add

263
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,583
a group of protesters
who attacked a truck

264
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:47,041
bound for Zaragoza Air Base,

265
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:50,458
believing that military personnel
were being evacuated.

266
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:55,125
We are connected with our correspondent
in Aragon for more on this.

267
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:58,000
Judit, have you been able to find
any more information

268
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,500
about this attack outside the base?

269
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:04,375
Good Morning, Saúl.
We've learned that two Air Force officers

270
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,000
have been hospitalized
after the attack...

271
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,500
Let's go home.

272
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,708
- Stand back, please.
- But how can we stand back?

273
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,083
- What's going on? Tell us something.
- Back, back.

274
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:21,041
- Sir? Move away.
- Can you tell me what's going on?

275
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,291
Move away, please.

276
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:26,041
Spread out. Clear the area. Go.

277
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,625
- Attention!
- Careful! Careful!

278
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:36,250
- What's going on?
- Please. Please, it's my...

279
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,875
We'll proceed to...
Clear everything.

280
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:51,250
- My love! Please! No!
- Keep walking, please. Disperse!

281
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,541
Disperse! Out!
There's nothing to see here, folks!

282
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,000
It's Joaquín Teban!

283
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:55,958
...serious condition.
We're asking for help with the delay.

284
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,958
BELÉN - ANSWER

285
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,666
Hello.

286
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,208
How are you?

287
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,041
Did you take something to calm down?

288
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:25,458
Have they told you
when they're going to open the airspace?

289
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:31,458
Well, it's just that with the new variant,
there are no plans for the short term.

290
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,833
Look, listen, this is important.

291
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:38,583
They're organizing safe zones
to redistribute the population.

292
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,125
They want to move us?

293
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:44,958
Yes, well, they want to set up
quarantine zones to control the virus.

294
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:48,000
But, there are critical voices
inside the army.

295
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:53,166
The greater the number of people,
the greater the number of infections.

296
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,208
And things have happened in Belgium.

297
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,875
So, no matter what, stay at home.

298
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,333
Understand?
No matter what.

299
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:07,791
- Hey, do you promise me that?
- Yes, of course. I promise.

300
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,250
Keep me posted.

301
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:13,000
Mario is on alert and he's bringing you
with us as soon as he can.

302
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,583
- I love you very much.
- I love you, too.

303
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:24,375
Good morning. The latest news.

304
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:27,208
Germany declares a quarantine in Munich.

305
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:30,500
As of a few hours ago,
It is forbidden to enter or leave

306
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:33,833
the 11th most populated city
in the EU.

307
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:38,000
Not the first city of the continent
that has been confined, but the biggest

308
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:39,625
in which there is a total closure.

309
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:45,041
In fact, it is still not known
how the government is reacting.

310
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:47,375
Oh, my God! What's he doing?

311
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:49,375
Is he eating it? It's...

312
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:51,083
Should we help him or what?

313
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:53,083
What should we do, help him? Oh fuck.

314
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,791
...areas of the federal state of Bavaria
will be evaluated every eight hours.

315
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:06,000
You can use things like this as armor.
Durable.

316
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:08,583
If they come to bite, they bite here.
They're fucked.

317
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:10,458
See? Foolproof.

318
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:14,875
What? Over here? Over here?
Where are they going to get in? Okay?

319
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:16,958
STATE OF EMERGENCY

320
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:27,791
A State of Emergency is declared
in all national territory

321
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:30,833
due to special circumstances
in order to preserve order and integrity.

322
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:32,791
Measures and restrictions
will be implemented:

323
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,875
FROM 2:00PM ALL COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY
IS SUSPENDED.

324
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:36,333
THE POPULATION MAY BE MILITARIZED

325
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:38,000
Comply with authority
for your safety.

326
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:46,333
I don't know, I don't know.

327
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:48,250
No, I don't know what's happening.
Let's go.

328
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:49,916
- Run, I think someone's coming.
- Run.

329
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,625
- Open the car.
- Let's go.

330
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:55,458
What's wrong with you, crazy?
You're crazy, dude!

331
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:24,125
Let's get out of here!

332
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:11,291
Help!

333
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:21,166
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

334
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:26,750
Help! Help! Help! Help!

335
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:28,541
Come on, fucker.

336
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:32,708
Help!

337
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:42,916
No, no, no.

338
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,708
- Are you okay?
- Don't come any closer.

339
00:26:02,791 --> 00:26:04,000
Don't come any closer.

340
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:16,208
Good evening.

341
00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:19,666
Apologies for the late hour
at which the cabinet meeting ended.

342
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,916
I am appearing before you very briefly

343
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,208
because in half an hour
we'll be meeting again

344
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:27,083
again to continue coordinating efforts
with our European partners.

345
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:32,000
As of today, the incidence rate of TSJ
is out of control across the globe,

346
00:26:32,583 --> 00:26:34,250
and Spain is no exception.

347
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:38,208
Yesterday at 8:00 pm, my government
ordered the temporary evacuation

348
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:41,541
of several population centers
on the Mediterranean coast of Spain

349
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:44,791
and extended the lockdown

350
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:47,791
of cities with more than
400,000 inhabitants.

351
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:52,291
The remaining population centers
will be moved to safe zones.

352
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:57,291
To this end, citizens must follow
the guidelines

353
00:26:57,375 --> 00:26:59,458
issued by the regional control units

354
00:26:59,541 --> 00:27:03,333
and the security forces
acting under their authority.

355
00:27:03,416 --> 00:27:06,375
All citizens are reminded
to comply...

356
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,500
EVACUATION
VEHICLE

357
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:08,833
...with their orders.

358
00:27:08,958 --> 00:27:12,500
Failure to do so will result
in criminal consequences

359
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:14,291
once normalcy is restored.

360
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:19,291
As a matter of fact, from the temporary
command center

361
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:21,416
at La Graciosa in the Canary Islands,

362
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,958
we'd like to pay tribute
to the hundreds of men and women

363
00:27:25,041 --> 00:27:27,875
of law enforcement
who are giving their lives

364
00:27:27,958 --> 00:27:31,333
to save as many citizens as possible.

365
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:36,916
You have the respect of the Crown,
the government and the country.

366
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:39,583
And lastly,

367
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:43,083
the CECOP has stated
that given the lack of maintenance

368
00:27:43,166 --> 00:27:47,541
and as a failure prevention
of the usual means of communication,

369
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:53,625
communications will be made
only on the emergency radio network.

370
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,208
Thank you very much.

371
00:28:06,041 --> 00:28:09,916
Prepare to be evacuated
to the nearest safe zone.

372
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,791
You will remain there
until the health emergency is over.

373
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:17,958
Refusal to evacuate will be considered
a violation of National Security Law.

374
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:19,833
Please, please.

375
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:22,416
Go up, please.

376
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:24,208
I don't know, ma'am. Please.

377
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:26,958
- Ma'am, you can't lock the car. Ma'am...
- Shut up.

378
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:32,416
Prepare to be evacuated
to the nearest safe zone.

379
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:39,708
Don't get on that bus
Please, stay in the house

380
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,208
We'll come find you
soon

381
00:28:56,625 --> 00:28:58,708
Stop already. Enough, please.

382
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:02,041
I'm coming, I'm coming,
I'm coming. I'm coming.

383
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,541
This is the Army speaking.
We must evacuate.

384
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:31,750
Shut up!

385
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:33,916
We know you're there! Come out!

386
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:42,583
We have orders
to evacuate the area immediately.

387
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:45,875
Open the door!

388
00:29:48,291 --> 00:29:49,958
Come on! We're going to come in!

389
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,833
We can't waste any more time.

390
00:29:54,916 --> 00:29:58,083
We have to move you
to a safe zone immediately.

391
00:29:58,208 --> 00:30:00,666
Come out immediately. This is an order.

392
00:30:01,291 --> 00:30:02,625
Open the door!

393
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:06,083
I'm coming in there!

394
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:10,875
This doesn't open. Let's get out of here.

395
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:28,208
Hi, Belén.

396
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:30,958
I hope you're okay.

397
00:30:31,875 --> 00:30:33,250
TWO WEEKS LATER...

398
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:35,541
I hope TSJ
hasn't reached the Canary Islands,

399
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:40,125
I'm incommunicado, but I'm okay.

400
00:30:40,208 --> 00:30:41,666
NOTICE OF MANDATORY EVACUATION

401
00:30:41,791 --> 00:30:44,583
My only problem is that
I'm starting to run out of food.

402
00:30:45,791 --> 00:30:48,666
I've been thinking about
taking my chances and leaving the house,

403
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:51,458
but I don't know how dangerous
it might be.

404
00:30:51,541 --> 00:30:54,583
The good thing is that between
the solar panels and the batteries,

405
00:30:54,666 --> 00:30:56,125
I can still stay here for a while.

406
00:30:56,208 --> 00:30:58,541
ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEM
LITHIUM BATTERY

407
00:30:58,625 --> 00:31:01,625
And well, never mind...
let's see if I get a signal again.

408
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:04,833
And we can finally speak.

409
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,000
I love you all.

410
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:40,958
I don't have anything.

411
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:47,333
They said they were just going
to get the children to safety,

412
00:33:47,416 --> 00:33:49,125
and he'd be back soon.

413
00:33:49,625 --> 00:33:52,500
But after half an hour,
his phone had already been shut off.

414
00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:54,791
Why didn't you go with the soldiers?

415
00:33:55,416 --> 00:33:59,083
My brother-in-law is in the military
and advised me not to go. And you?

416
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,750
The bus was faster than I was.

417
00:34:06,791 --> 00:34:07,958
You did well.

418
00:34:08,083 --> 00:34:12,166
Imagine what would happen if there's an
outbreak among the people they've taken.

419
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,166
You did well too.

420
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:18,041
I'm sure they wouldn't have let you take
that beautiful cat you have.

421
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:20,625
He watches me from the window a lot.

422
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,791
Forgive me for asking you like this...

423
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:29,958
Do you have anything to eat?

424
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:34,500
I could barely buy anything
before all this.

425
00:34:34,583 --> 00:34:37,791
And there might be infected people
outside of the residential area.

426
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:39,833
That's why you're dressed like a diver.

427
00:34:39,916 --> 00:34:42,750
- This? It's--
- So they can't bite you, yeah.

428
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:44,458
It's well-conceived.

429
00:34:46,458 --> 00:34:49,166
And you haven't even found
a box of cookies?

430
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:53,958
All the houses I've looked at are empty.

431
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:56,875
I think I can help you with that.

432
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:06,750
That one.

433
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:10,125
That's the Fidalgos.
They went with the soldiers.

434
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:14,375
But the day before,
I saw them come home with bags.

435
00:35:14,458 --> 00:35:16,750
I doubt they ate everything.

436
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:23,750
That's the Arnaiz family.

437
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:27,291
They had five children. So, there may
still be a lot of stuff inside that house,

438
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,583
but hardly a loaf of bread.

439
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:31,166
The Rosales family.

440
00:35:32,541 --> 00:35:34,458
The youngest was my daughter's friend.

441
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:36,291
A piece of work.

442
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,375
You might walk in
and find their abandoned parents.

443
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,125
IT WON'T DEFEAT US

444
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:53,166
There were bigger houses
at the back.

445
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:56,250
I'm sure you can find us
something to eat there.

446
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:59,583
- You know everyone.
- Are you calling me a gossip?

447
00:35:59,666 --> 00:36:01,500
I'm calling you my savior.

448
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:50,375
Walkies.

449
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:02,625
If this is all we can get,
you should have gone with the military.

450
00:37:02,708 --> 00:37:05,750
We'll end up eating each other here.

451
00:37:06,666 --> 00:37:10,958
That, or the Santa Compaña
will come for both of us.

452
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,833
There might be a house
with food left.

453
00:37:15,916 --> 00:37:17,333
Which one?

454
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:24,625
- I'll keep you informed, okay?
- Okay.

455
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:33,833
Gabriela, I'm going in.

456
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:36,416
I'm sorry.

457
00:38:37,541 --> 00:38:40,000
- I thought no one was here.
- No, no, I...

458
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:43,291
- I'm leaving. I'm leaving now.
- Wait, wait, we can...

459
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,625
Do you miss them?

460
00:39:33,375 --> 00:39:35,458
I miss that they didn't say goodbye.

461
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:40,333
Gabriela.

462
00:39:41,375 --> 00:39:45,291
I'm sorry, but I don't think your family
treated you well, not at all.

463
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,416
They did the best they could.

464
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,500
Sometimes things can be done better.

465
00:39:53,166 --> 00:39:56,833
And you? Don't you miss that girl?

466
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:59,083
I haven't seen her in a while.

467
00:40:01,375 --> 00:40:04,041
- Forgive me for asking, I didn't want...
- No. No, no.

468
00:40:04,875 --> 00:40:06,500
I'm sorry, Gabriela.

469
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:09,208
She died a little over a year ago.

470
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:11,916
In a car accident.

471
00:40:13,125 --> 00:40:14,625
I'm sorry.

472
00:40:14,708 --> 00:40:17,666
I don't know, Maybe it's better
she didn't live to see this.

473
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,583
Do you have photos of her?

474
00:40:23,458 --> 00:40:24,541
Yes, of course.

475
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,916
Here.

476
00:40:34,541 --> 00:40:36,125
How lovely.

477
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:51,125
You should meet my neighbor.

478
00:40:51,208 --> 00:40:54,750
In one week, I have anecdotes to tell
for the rest of my life.

479
00:41:02,541 --> 00:41:03,791
Belén...

480
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,500
Nothing, I just wanted to tell you that
I'm sorry.

481
00:41:12,708 --> 00:41:14,958
For not having come to visit
this whole year.

482
00:41:17,666 --> 00:41:19,833
You only lived half a hour away and...

483
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:27,208
I've been an idiot.

484
00:41:28,833 --> 00:41:30,291
That's all. It's just...

485
00:41:31,583 --> 00:41:32,958
Sending a kiss.

486
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:22,708
Are you there?

487
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,000
Can you hear me?

488
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:31,458
- Yes?
- It's Gabriela. Do you have a radio?

489
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:41,166
On 100.

490
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,333
Okay. Okay, okay.

491
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:55,791
I think I have something.

492
00:42:58,041 --> 00:43:00,416
- They're playing music.
- Wait.

493
00:43:04,541 --> 00:43:08,333
This message is for all survivors
who are listening.

494
00:43:08,416 --> 00:43:10,750
You can find us in the Arousa Estuary,

495
00:43:10,833 --> 00:43:16,500
- coordinates 36 degrees 37-31 to 72 W.
- What do you think?

496
00:43:16,625 --> 00:43:19,833
- We're sending survivors to the Canaries.
- I don't know.

497
00:43:19,958 --> 00:43:21,916
I don't trust the estuary.

498
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,250
If people gather there,
there will be more risk of infection.

499
00:43:26,375 --> 00:43:28,208
Yeah, but we're running out of food.

500
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,625
We could try.

501
00:43:36,041 --> 00:43:38,333
I don't know, son. I don't know.

502
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:41,250
And how would we get there?

503
00:43:42,416 --> 00:43:44,250
We could take my boat.

504
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:48,291
I can't.

505
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:50,583
What do you mean, you can't?
Of course you can.

506
00:43:50,666 --> 00:43:53,416
I'm barely capable of going out
to the street.

507
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,333
No. Don't worry.

508
00:43:55,416 --> 00:43:58,541
I'll help you. Whatever it takes.

509
00:44:00,041 --> 00:44:01,333
Gabriela.

510
00:44:04,625 --> 00:44:06,125
Can you hear me?

511
00:44:16,791 --> 00:44:18,333
I'm here.

512
00:44:20,375 --> 00:44:21,708
Okay.

513
00:44:22,458 --> 00:44:25,333
If you think I won't be a burden,
I'll go with you.

514
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
We'll make it, Gabriela.

515
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,083
You'll see.

516
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:12,666
Gabriela, I'll be there in five minutes.

517
00:45:25,708 --> 00:45:27,333
Gabriela, can you hear me?

518
00:45:56,833 --> 00:45:58,208
Gabriela?

519
00:46:02,666 --> 00:46:03,916
Gabriela!

520
00:46:07,458 --> 00:46:09,125
Gabriela!

521
00:46:16,708 --> 00:46:21,708
THANK YOU FOR THESE DAYS
NOW YOU HAVE TO SAVE YOURSELF

522
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,458
Gabriela.

523
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,291
Belén,

524
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:38,958
infected people are showing up and...

525
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:42,583
I don't think I can
wait for you any longer.

526
00:48:43,333 --> 00:48:45,083
I received a message over the radio

527
00:48:45,166 --> 00:48:48,000
from a group of survivors
at the estuary...

528
00:48:48,083 --> 00:48:50,125
who from there are going
to go to the Canaries.

529
00:48:50,208 --> 00:48:52,333
I'm going to meet up with them.

530
00:48:52,416 --> 00:48:55,083
With a little luck,
I'll find a location with coverage

531
00:48:55,166 --> 00:48:57,375
and I'll be able to send you
all this at once.

532
00:48:57,458 --> 00:49:00,458
Don't worry if it takes a few days
to hear from me, okay?

533
00:51:49,791 --> 00:51:52,291
Lúculo! Lúculo!

534
00:51:56,708 --> 00:51:58,333
Lúculo! Lúculo!

535
00:51:58,416 --> 00:52:01,000
Are you okay? Okay, okay.
Okay.

536
00:52:05,791 --> 00:52:07,083
Let's go.

537
00:53:39,291 --> 00:53:40,666
Fuck!

538
00:54:14,541 --> 00:54:16,750
It's all right. Easy.

539
00:54:18,541 --> 00:54:19,875
That's it.

540
00:54:23,416 --> 00:54:25,541
It's all right, that's it. That's it.

541
00:56:11,125 --> 00:56:12,541
Come on.

542
00:56:31,958 --> 00:56:33,083
Damn it!

543
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:52,708
Hi, sister.

544
00:56:53,458 --> 00:56:55,541
I still haven't found coverage.

545
00:56:57,291 --> 00:57:00,250
You were right not to trust
the safe zones.

546
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:01,750
Leaving the housing development,

547
00:57:01,833 --> 00:57:05,458
I saw an abandoned military detachment,
or something like that.

548
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:09,791
And now I'm going down
the Pontevedra Estuary and...

549
00:57:10,375 --> 00:57:12,083
it's all destroyed.

550
00:57:13,958 --> 00:57:17,875
I just want you to know I'm okay,
and I'm strong.

551
00:57:17,958 --> 00:57:21,333
I think I found a way
to get to the Canary Islands.

552
00:57:22,666 --> 00:57:24,000
I love you all.

553
00:57:25,791 --> 00:57:27,708
And I really miss you.

554
00:58:47,583 --> 00:58:51,833
Hey! Hey! Hello! Hello!

555
00:58:51,916 --> 00:58:55,708
Help! Help! Here!

556
00:59:23,833 --> 00:59:26,333
Relax. Relax.

557
01:00:07,291 --> 01:00:08,833
Hello.

558
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:31,458
My name is Pritchenko. Viktor Pritchenko.

559
01:00:32,083 --> 01:00:34,250
He's Ushakov, captain of the boat.

560
01:00:34,916 --> 01:00:37,833
The captain wants to know
if you're from around here.

561
01:00:38,708 --> 01:00:43,458
Yes. I live very close to Pontevedra.
In a kind of residential development.

562
01:00:48,083 --> 01:00:50,041
And where are you from?

563
01:00:51,041 --> 01:00:53,291
What were you doing in the estuary?

564
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:56,125
I've been following the radio message

565
01:00:56,208 --> 01:00:58,416
- to go to the Canary Islands.
- The Canary Islands?

566
01:01:00,041 --> 01:01:04,208
Yes. The government, the military,
everybody's there.

567
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,250
If you want, I can take you.
I know the route.

568
01:01:13,541 --> 01:01:18,125
The ship broke down
just as the "viys" arrived.

569
01:01:18,208 --> 01:01:23,083
The police didn't let anyone disembark,
that's why they're all here.

570
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:24,791
I'm sorry.

571
01:01:31,416 --> 01:01:34,625
- What do you do?
- I'm a lawyer.

572
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:42,041
Well, and I have a small
solar panel company.

573
01:01:54,208 --> 01:01:56,541
I said you're an engineer.

574
01:01:57,708 --> 01:01:59,875
Nobody likes lawyers.

575
01:02:02,958 --> 01:02:08,041
I came from Ukraine to pilot firefighting
helicopters a few months ago.

576
01:02:08,625 --> 01:02:11,583
And to see the famous Vigo Christmas.

577
01:02:12,375 --> 01:02:14,750
Well, for a Ukrainian,
you speak Spanish very well.

578
01:02:14,833 --> 01:02:16,750
Yeah, yeah. My mother was Mexican.

579
01:02:17,208 --> 01:02:20,833
I learned to speak Russian in school.

580
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:23,500
Over there, it was like English.

581
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:29,041
That's all we can offer now.

582
01:02:36,791 --> 01:02:40,125
- Thank you very much.
- Tomorrow we'll need you

583
01:02:40,208 --> 01:02:42,125
you to identify locations in the area

584
01:02:42,208 --> 01:02:45,458
where we can find materials,
provisions.

585
01:02:45,583 --> 01:02:47,708
- Okay?
- Of course, whatever you need.

586
01:02:48,166 --> 01:02:50,208
- Okay.
- Excuse me...

587
01:02:52,166 --> 01:02:54,750
Haven't you found any more survivors?

588
01:02:56,750 --> 01:02:58,875
No, I'm afraid you're the first.

589
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,583
Rest up, okay?

590
01:04:31,375 --> 01:04:33,291
How did you sleep?

591
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:41,666
Don't run up the stairs,
they're very slippery.

592
01:04:43,041 --> 01:04:44,958
The captain wants to talk to you.

593
01:04:48,791 --> 01:04:52,000
Hey, last night,
I saw new people arrive, right?

594
01:04:52,791 --> 01:04:54,375
Nobody came last night.

595
01:04:54,458 --> 01:04:57,541
What do you mean? There were two men,
and a woman and a girl too.

596
01:04:57,625 --> 01:04:59,125
Hey...

597
01:04:59,458 --> 01:05:02,375
Nobody arrived last night, understood?

598
01:05:09,625 --> 01:05:13,416
This is a car factory. Do you know it?

599
01:05:13,916 --> 01:05:15,958
I'm sure it's been ransacked,

600
01:05:16,041 --> 01:05:18,791
but you could find
all kinds of materials there.

601
01:05:24,416 --> 01:05:28,208
Concrete. Is there concrete around there?

602
01:05:29,166 --> 01:05:32,083
I don't know. Concrete?

603
01:05:41,916 --> 01:05:44,708
There's a plant on the way to Vilagarcía.

604
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:41,958
The ones who arrived last night
are downstairs, right?

605
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:46,333
Ushakov wants your help.

606
01:06:47,291 --> 01:06:49,916
Say thank you and forget everything else.

607
01:06:50,833 --> 01:06:53,041
What the fuck is going on here?

608
01:06:55,541 --> 01:06:58,000
Viktor, tell me truth. Are we prisoners?

609
01:06:58,083 --> 01:06:59,666
The interrogation is over.

610
01:07:06,458 --> 01:07:09,833
Listen, I know where there's a helicopter.

611
01:07:11,541 --> 01:07:14,375
At a hospital,
on the outskirts of Pontevedra.

612
01:07:14,458 --> 01:07:18,000
We can take it and fly to
the Canary Islands. You're a pilot, right?

613
01:07:38,583 --> 01:07:40,500
Do you want to stay alive?

614
01:07:41,708 --> 01:07:45,083
Keep your head down.
Don't ask any more questions.

615
01:08:01,208 --> 01:08:03,375
The vacation at sea is over.

616
01:09:07,375 --> 01:09:09,375
Please don't hate me, okay?

617
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:33,750
My wife and my daughter!
My wife and my daughter!

618
01:10:33,875 --> 01:10:35,833
- Calm down, please. Calm down.
- Please.

619
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:56,958
Calm down. Calm down.
I don't know where they are.

620
01:11:42,083 --> 01:11:44,625
I told you not to get into trouble.

621
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:31,625
I hope what you said
about the helicopter is true.

622
01:14:05,791 --> 01:14:08,750
Hurry up! Faster!

623
01:14:41,375 --> 01:14:42,666
Come on, Viktor.

624
01:14:52,250 --> 01:14:53,583
Hold on, fuck.

625
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:47,625
CHARGING

626
01:15:54,208 --> 01:15:56,458
There's a heliport at a hospital
very close to here.

627
01:15:56,541 --> 01:15:59,666
You'll see, we'll be in the Canary Islands
before you know it.

628
01:16:03,041 --> 01:16:06,583
- Viktor, answer me. Viktor, wake up!
- I'm here. I'm here.

629
01:16:11,166 --> 01:16:12,750
Thank you.

630
01:16:13,416 --> 01:16:15,666
Thank you for saving my life, Viktor.

631
01:16:19,083 --> 01:16:21,375
Ushakov is a monster.

632
01:16:22,458 --> 01:16:25,625
This hell fits him like a glove.

633
01:16:28,208 --> 01:16:30,750
And what did he do
with the families of these men?

634
01:16:32,791 --> 01:16:36,375
He's building a refuge
on the island of Sálvora.

635
01:16:38,250 --> 01:16:42,541
He only lets those who serve him live.

636
01:16:46,750 --> 01:16:50,125
When all this ends, people will have to
answer for what they've done.

637
01:16:50,208 --> 01:16:52,416
Look around you.

638
01:16:55,208 --> 01:16:57,125
This will never end.

639
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,166
No, no, no, no.

640
01:17:30,916 --> 01:17:33,375
Where is it? No, no, no, no, no.

641
01:17:34,333 --> 01:17:35,916
What about the helicopter?

642
01:18:23,250 --> 01:18:26,791
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
Easy. No. No, no, no, no, no.

643
01:18:31,041 --> 01:18:34,375
Let's go, Viktor. Let's go, go, go, go.

644
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,250
Wait here.

645
01:19:08,291 --> 01:19:09,708
Let's go.

646
01:19:11,458 --> 01:19:12,875
That's it.

647
01:19:17,208 --> 01:19:19,083
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

648
01:19:21,333 --> 01:19:22,916
Wait.

649
01:19:30,333 --> 01:19:31,416
Let's go.

650
01:19:36,208 --> 01:19:37,541
Wait.

651
01:19:42,458 --> 01:19:43,583
Come on.

652
01:19:45,416 --> 01:19:46,333
Hold on.

653
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:52,583
Let's go.

654
01:19:54,541 --> 01:19:55,958
That's it.

655
01:20:08,833 --> 01:20:10,791
- Take it out.
- What?

656
01:20:11,875 --> 01:20:14,791
- I don't understand.
- You have to take the bullet out.

657
01:20:15,583 --> 01:20:17,541
You have to take the bullet out.

658
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:20,250
Okay.

659
01:20:21,333 --> 01:20:23,791
All right. One moment.

660
01:20:37,375 --> 01:20:39,916
Hold on. Hold on, okay?

661
01:20:41,625 --> 01:20:44,375
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

662
01:20:45,958 --> 01:20:49,875
Don't move from here.
Stay with him, okay? Go on.

663
01:21:24,583 --> 01:21:26,083
Max, please.

664
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:27,916
Go away, they're here!

665
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,083
Hello?

666
01:21:34,583 --> 01:21:35,958
Me, Leila.

667
01:21:36,041 --> 01:21:37,625
It was me, Lucía.

668
01:21:39,541 --> 01:21:41,541
Iria, you'll get caught!

669
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,500
Hello?

670
01:23:31,875 --> 01:23:32,875
Hello?

671
01:23:34,166 --> 01:23:35,583
Hello? Is someone there?

672
01:23:37,125 --> 01:23:39,666
- Hello?
- Hi. Where are you?

673
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:41,958
- There's a man here.
- Where? Down there?

674
01:23:42,041 --> 01:23:43,916
Yes, down there.

675
01:23:44,041 --> 01:23:45,458
- Please.
- Hello.

676
01:23:45,541 --> 01:23:48,291
There's a man here.
Yes, and you can hear him

677
01:23:48,375 --> 01:23:51,000
- Hello! Please, here!
- Is someone there?

678
01:23:51,083 --> 01:23:53,958
Yes, yes, hello.
We're in the operating room.

679
01:23:55,541 --> 01:23:58,500
Hi? We're here. Can you hear us?

680
01:24:01,041 --> 01:24:03,000
No, no, no, no!

681
01:25:10,708 --> 01:25:12,375
Over here! Come on!

682
01:25:21,416 --> 01:25:22,625
Let's go.

683
01:25:27,041 --> 01:25:28,333
- Help me.
- Yes.

684
01:25:28,416 --> 01:25:29,583
Wait.

685
01:25:32,375 --> 01:25:34,416
- Come on, Viktor.
- Careful with his neck.

686
01:25:34,583 --> 01:25:36,000
Let's go.

687
01:25:36,458 --> 01:25:38,250
The legs.

688
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,291
He's in bad shape. Come on. Let's see.

689
01:25:41,833 --> 01:25:45,041
- Okay. Quickly
- Yes.

690
01:25:46,125 --> 01:25:47,583
To the back.

691
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,291
Lucía.

692
01:25:52,875 --> 01:25:55,875
Help us. He's wounded.

693
01:26:01,208 --> 01:26:04,875
- What happened to him?
- He's been shot.

694
01:26:11,208 --> 01:26:14,250
Come on, let's go.
Kids, move aside.

695
01:26:29,916 --> 01:26:31,458
Do you think it scratches?

696
01:26:32,333 --> 01:26:34,333
- He looks nice.
- Yeah.

697
01:26:35,708 --> 01:26:38,041
- Do you think he'll let us pet him?
- I don't know.

698
01:26:42,375 --> 01:26:43,833
You ask.

699
01:26:43,916 --> 01:26:46,583
- You go, you go. I want to pet him.
- Yes, me. You go.

700
01:26:47,458 --> 01:26:49,791
- You tell him.
- You tell him.

701
01:26:50,708 --> 01:26:52,625
What's his name?

702
01:26:54,750 --> 01:26:57,125
- His name is Lúculo.
- Lúculo?

703
01:26:59,791 --> 01:27:02,500
He was a Roman soldier who ate a lot.

704
01:27:03,333 --> 01:27:05,916
But, don't ask me anything else,
I didn't name him.

705
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:09,125
- Is he very old?
- Four years.

706
01:27:10,166 --> 01:27:11,458
Do you want to pet him?

707
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,375
Come on. Let's go.

708
01:27:18,166 --> 01:27:19,541
It's okay.

709
01:27:25,416 --> 01:27:28,166
Relax, they just want to meet you.

710
01:27:29,708 --> 01:27:31,500
Carefully. Very good.

711
01:27:32,375 --> 01:27:34,666
- Like this, carefully.
- He's so soft.

712
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:36,708
- Very good.
- So soft.

713
01:27:37,333 --> 01:27:38,791
He's very beautiful.

714
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:42,916
Stay calm, it's okay.
We just want to meet you.

715
01:27:44,166 --> 01:27:45,583
We've removed the bullet.

716
01:27:45,708 --> 01:27:48,833
He has a slight fever,
so we have to wait.

717
01:27:50,458 --> 01:27:52,833
Thank you. Thank you very much.

718
01:27:54,833 --> 01:27:57,333
We didn't know there was anyone in here.

719
01:27:58,416 --> 01:28:02,458
We were looking for a helicopter,
but we were too late.

720
01:28:03,708 --> 01:28:05,000
Are you a pilot?

721
01:28:15,750 --> 01:28:18,166
It was the triage and quarantine area.

722
01:28:19,208 --> 01:28:21,000
It didn't last half a day.

723
01:28:23,916 --> 01:28:25,791
Is there any way to get down there?

724
01:28:27,125 --> 01:28:28,750
Not from this building.

725
01:28:29,416 --> 01:28:30,958
The courtyard is full of them,

726
01:28:31,041 --> 01:28:34,000
and without weapons,
we wouldn't last long.

727
01:28:36,333 --> 01:28:39,416
Below are the boilers,
which have access to the courtyard,

728
01:28:40,416 --> 01:28:42,833
but a few days ago,
we heard an explosion and I...

729
01:28:43,375 --> 01:28:45,125
I don't know,

730
01:28:45,458 --> 01:28:50,625
it is dangerous for the children.

731
01:29:12,083 --> 01:29:14,583
Can your friend really fly
that helicopter?

732
01:29:15,375 --> 01:29:17,041
Yes. If he recovers, yes.

733
01:29:17,375 --> 01:29:19,125
We're almost out of food.

734
01:29:20,916 --> 01:29:21,916
And their parents?

735
01:29:22,916 --> 01:29:25,833
They died. They worked here.

736
01:29:26,333 --> 01:29:29,291
It's been very difficult for them.
Poor little angels.

737
01:29:33,875 --> 01:29:36,041
Iria didn't speak for a week.

738
01:29:37,833 --> 01:29:40,375
Leila is still getting used
to the situation.

739
01:29:40,458 --> 01:29:43,083
Some days, she still asks
when her mother will come back.

740
01:29:43,166 --> 01:29:45,541
- And what do you tell them?
- The truth.

741
01:29:46,041 --> 01:29:47,875
In their way, with their words.

742
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:51,791
We always try and find moments
during the day talk about their parents.

743
01:29:51,916 --> 01:29:55,166
We ask them to remember
happy moments they shared with them.

744
01:29:55,250 --> 01:29:57,250
Sister Cecilia, I'm thirsty.

745
01:29:58,250 --> 01:29:59,625
Okay.

746
01:30:01,625 --> 01:30:05,958
The key is not to resist the pain

747
01:30:06,041 --> 01:30:08,250
and to learn to live with it.

748
01:30:10,208 --> 01:30:12,875
It's the only way
to let it go, little by little.

749
01:30:13,916 --> 01:30:15,541
If only it were that easy.

750
01:30:21,541 --> 01:30:23,333
My wife died here.

751
01:30:26,708 --> 01:30:29,875
- A little over a year ago.
- I'm sorry.

752
01:31:09,208 --> 01:31:11,166
...is going into cardiac arrest.

753
01:32:09,791 --> 01:32:11,208
I'm sorry, Júlia.

754
01:32:13,375 --> 01:32:16,166
I thought we had
all the time in the world.

755
01:32:21,333 --> 01:32:22,541
Forgive me.

756
01:33:21,875 --> 01:33:23,708
NOTIFICATIONS
BELÉN

757
01:33:28,333 --> 01:33:31,000
- Mom, come to the pool. Come on!
- Just a minute.

758
01:33:31,083 --> 01:33:33,416
Carlos, wait, I'm calling your uncle.

759
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,708
Well, I haven't heard from you
for two hours.

760
01:33:38,416 --> 01:33:40,666
Mario says it's normal,
that the networks fail, and...

761
01:33:40,750 --> 01:33:44,208
- Let's go! Mom, come to the pool.
- Carlos, please, wait.

762
01:33:44,791 --> 01:33:48,291
Well, I'll try later, okay? Bye, bye.
Guys!

763
01:33:50,958 --> 01:33:52,791
They left me alone, at home.

764
01:33:53,416 --> 01:33:57,625
They're setting up some games
on the beach for the kids here.

765
01:33:59,041 --> 01:34:01,250
I'm really worried, little brother.

766
01:34:01,375 --> 01:34:03,500
I hope you get this message

767
01:34:03,958 --> 01:34:06,291
and remember how much I love you.

768
01:34:07,208 --> 01:34:11,416
I don't know when we'll be able to
talk again. Take care.

769
01:34:12,083 --> 01:34:14,541
When will you come to us?

770
01:34:14,625 --> 01:34:16,416
Because we...

771
01:34:17,083 --> 01:34:19,458
- We miss you a lot.
- A lot.

772
01:34:19,541 --> 01:34:22,708
- And we... love you. Very much!
- We love you.

773
01:34:24,916 --> 01:34:26,083
Bye.

774
01:34:28,666 --> 01:34:31,333
And Lúculo? How's Lúculo? Where's Lúculo?

775
01:34:31,458 --> 01:34:33,708
Lúculo? How's Lúculo?
Maybe he's gone out...

776
01:34:33,791 --> 01:34:38,000
Come here. Will you quit stealing my...
Stop stealing my phone!

777
01:34:47,250 --> 01:34:48,708
Belén.

778
01:34:49,666 --> 01:34:51,125
I'm doing well.

779
01:34:52,958 --> 01:34:54,750
I'm doing really well now.

780
01:34:56,166 --> 01:34:57,500
It's just that...

781
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,291
You wouldn't even believe
where I ended up.

782
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:28,250
- Very dangerous people are coming.
- Did they follow you?

783
01:35:28,333 --> 01:35:30,708
They're looking for supplies in the area.

784
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,083
You've put us in danger.

785
01:35:33,416 --> 01:35:37,208
We have to reach the helicopter
before them. Where are those tunnels?

786
01:35:38,333 --> 01:35:39,916
- Let's go.
- What's wrong, Lucía?

787
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,750
- Let's go change.
- Where are we going?

788
01:35:41,833 --> 01:35:44,375
- Where are we going?
- Let's go, let's go.

789
01:35:46,291 --> 01:35:48,500
One last effort. I promise.

790
01:35:55,458 --> 01:35:57,125
Your mouth. Tightly.

791
01:35:57,958 --> 01:35:59,791
Like that. Very good.

792
01:36:01,125 --> 01:36:02,875
How are you doing? Ready?

793
01:36:12,625 --> 01:36:15,083
Don't take it off, okay?

794
01:36:15,166 --> 01:36:17,250
No matter what happens. Let's go.

795
01:36:25,666 --> 01:36:27,666
Careful. There are stairs.

796
01:36:28,958 --> 01:36:30,666
Slowly. Slowly.

797
01:36:36,125 --> 01:36:37,958
Hey kids, don't look.

798
01:36:38,041 --> 01:36:39,708
We're sticking together closely.

799
01:36:53,625 --> 01:36:56,125
- How much left?
- Just a little, I think.

800
01:37:20,541 --> 01:37:21,958
Did you hear that?

801
01:37:23,625 --> 01:37:25,208
Let's go, quickly.

802
01:37:30,791 --> 01:37:32,541
Come on.

803
01:37:50,083 --> 01:37:52,583
The heat must have warped the door.

804
01:38:00,583 --> 01:38:02,125
Max.

805
01:38:03,041 --> 01:38:04,833
- Carefully, okay?
- Okay.

806
01:38:13,666 --> 01:38:15,500
Hit it with the axe.

807
01:38:55,958 --> 01:38:57,750
Sister Cecilia.

808
01:39:09,833 --> 01:39:12,791
No. Don't come any closer.

809
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:18,041
Save the children.

810
01:39:20,291 --> 01:39:22,208
Please, save them.

811
01:40:01,416 --> 01:40:05,125
Okay. I think the door is locked
from the outside. I need to open it.

812
01:40:05,208 --> 01:40:07,333
Okay. I'll cover you.

813
01:41:11,125 --> 01:41:12,583
Mom.

814
01:41:43,666 --> 01:41:45,666
Let's go.

815
01:42:28,250 --> 01:42:30,916
Are you okay? Are you okay?
Are you okay?

816
01:43:06,083 --> 01:43:08,916
- Leila! Oh my God.
- That's it, kids.

817
01:43:09,750 --> 01:43:12,125
- Hey, please... Are you okay?
- Lúculo.

818
01:43:12,208 --> 01:43:13,708
- That's it...
- Are you okay?

819
01:43:13,791 --> 01:43:15,833
That's it. That's it, dear,
we're going now.

820
01:43:17,250 --> 01:43:19,166
Are you okay?

821
01:43:19,791 --> 01:43:21,583
One last effort.

822
01:43:21,708 --> 01:43:23,333
What happened?

823
01:43:30,541 --> 01:43:33,875
How much time do you need
to start the helicopter?

824
01:43:35,250 --> 01:43:38,625
It depends on the shape it's in, but...

825
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,958
Just a little left, let's go.

826
01:43:47,583 --> 01:43:49,208
I have a plan.

827
01:44:40,958 --> 01:44:42,166
They're coming!

828
01:45:40,791 --> 01:45:42,125
I'm going.

829
01:45:44,875 --> 01:45:46,291
Quickly.

830
01:45:47,666 --> 01:45:49,583
Come on, let's go, run!

831
01:45:50,666 --> 01:45:53,208
- Lucía, run!
- Lucía!

832
01:45:53,375 --> 01:45:56,041
- Lucía!
- Lucía! Lucía!

833
01:45:56,125 --> 01:45:57,708
Lucía, run!

834
01:45:57,791 --> 01:46:00,375
Run, come on! Lucía!

835
01:46:06,958 --> 01:46:08,916
Run, come on! Lucía!

836
01:46:14,750 --> 01:46:15,583
Lucía!

837
01:46:15,666 --> 01:46:16,625
- Let's go!
- Lucía, run!

838
01:46:16,708 --> 01:46:17,625
Run, run!

839
01:46:18,708 --> 01:46:20,458
Run!

840
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:30,250
What's wrong?

841
01:46:30,625 --> 01:46:31,958
I don't know.

842
01:46:32,083 --> 01:46:35,500
- No, no, no, this can't happen, Viktor.
- Let me think.

843
01:46:39,041 --> 01:46:40,291
There's no time.

844
01:47:49,833 --> 01:47:50,958
Stay calm.

845
01:49:07,750 --> 01:49:08,916
Let's go!

846
01:50:16,208 --> 01:50:17,833
How are you doing?

847
01:50:18,958 --> 01:50:20,666
Alive.

848
01:50:21,833 --> 01:50:24,625
- And you?
- Barely.

849
01:50:46,750 --> 01:50:48,250
BELÉN - ANSWER

850
01:50:50,416 --> 01:50:51,958
- Belén.
- Manel?

851
01:50:52,041 --> 01:50:53,833
- Manel! Can you hear me?
- Yes.

852
01:50:54,250 --> 01:50:56,500
Manel, where are you?

853
01:50:57,083 --> 01:50:59,375
- I'm on my way.
- On your way?

854
01:50:59,458 --> 01:51:01,833
- In a helicopter, yes.
- What? Say again?

855
01:51:02,583 --> 01:51:04,958
On my way to the Canary Islands.
I made it, Belén.

856
01:51:05,041 --> 01:51:06,916
No! No, no, no!

857
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:08,625
- No! Don't come!
- What?

858
01:51:08,750 --> 01:51:12,208
No! Listen to me!
Don't come to the Canaries.

859
01:51:12,291 --> 01:51:16,625
For the love of God! Manel!
Manel, don't come to the Canaries.

860
01:51:16,708 --> 01:51:19,291
Turn back around! Turn around, don't come!

861
01:51:19,375 --> 01:51:21,458
Please don't come to the Canaries!

862
01:51:27,416 --> 01:51:28,583
