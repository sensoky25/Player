Oh. So,
they're just ignoring us?

'cause they want you
to translate that picture.

Oh.

751
00:38:40,708 --> 00:38:43,791
Oh. Your home island

752
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:48,541
is in the same sea
as Motufetū.

753

And when Nalo
divided the ocean

754

to weaken the people
of the sea,

755
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:58,916
your ancestors were
disconnected from their home.

756
00:39:00,458 --> 00:39:03,583
But you thought you'd finally
found the way back

757
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,625
when you ran
into this giant clam.

758
00:39:06,958 --> 00:39:12,041
And now, you're worried
you'll stay separated forever.

you'll help us reach Motufetū.

Hello? We're still jelly!

766
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:36,875
How're we gonna beat that?

767

Floppy can't even
wiggle a finger.

768
00:39:39,958 --> 00:39:42,708
Well, our muscles
are full of neurotoxin, so...

Wait. Wait. Hang on.

770
00:39:44,833 --> 00:39:46,875
A clam is basically
one giant muscle.

771
00:39:47,041 --> 00:39:48,583
So, we get close enough
with that stuff,

772
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:49,750
shoot it in the ganglion,

773
00:39:49,916 --> 00:39:52,583

It just went right over
the top of us, didn't it?

Okay, where do we get
the toxin for the clam?

Also, we do have a demigod.

1409
01:07:41,041 --> 01:07:42,625
Sure, he's a little scruffy,

1410
01:07:42,833 --> 01:07:44,375
but, you know,
better than nothing.

01:07:45,958 --> 01:07:49,416
Okay. We sail to the heart

01:07:50,375 --> 01:07:54,041
Once I raise the island,
you all have to get to it.

01:07:55,208 --> 01:07:58,166
It'll be harder than anything
we've faced before.
