<i>That logo music just gets you pumped.
Right?</i>

4
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:42,375
<i>I'm sorry. I just, I'm excited
to be here. It's been a while.</i>

5
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,375
<i>You know, for a long time,
I wasn't sure I'd ever be back.</i>

6
00:00:45,542 --> 00:00:46,500
<i>Disney bought Fox...</i>

7
00:00:46,667 --> 00:00:49,417
<i>there was a whole boring rights issue,
blabbity-blabbity-blah.</i>

8
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:52,333
<i>But then, it turned out, they wanted me.</i>

9
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,917
<i>The one guy
who shouldn't even have his own movie...</i>

10
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:56,667
<i>much less a franchise.</i>

11
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:59,333
<i>Marvel's so stupid.</i>

12
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:02,083
<i>Look, we know the title of this thing. So...</i>

13
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,583
<i>I know what you're wondering.</i>

14
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,583
<i>How are we gonna do this
without dishonoring Logan's memory?</i>

15
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:09,417
<i>And I'll tell you how.</i>

16
00:01:10,542 --> 00:01:11,375
<i>We're not.</i>

17
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,375
<i>I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.</i>

18
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,792
<i>Wolverine is not dead.</i>

19
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:20,917
<i>Sure, it made for a perfect ending
to a very sad story.</i>

20
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:24,250
<i>But that's not how
regenerative healing factors work.</i>

21
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:27,792
<i>You think I wanna be out here
in beautiful downtown North Dakota...</i>

22
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:30,792
<i>digging up the one and only Wolverine?
No, thank you.</i>

23
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,583
<i>But the fate of my entire world is at stake.</i>

24
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,458
<i>He may not be living his best life,
but he sure as hell ain't dead.</i>

25
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:44,958
Bingo.

26
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,750
Yahtzee.

27
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:52,917
Yes, yes, yes.

28
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,500
Damn it!

29
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:01,208
Son of a bitch!

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,083
You...

31
00:02:06,542 --> 00:02:09,792
Christ. Motherfucker!

32
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:11,500
My world is fuck...

33
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:13,958
That was weird.

34
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:15,833
I'm much calmer now.

35
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,917
Look, I'm not a man of science.

36
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:22,708
But you seem incredibly passed away.

37
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,042
But it's good to see ya.

38
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:31,125
I gotta be honest,
I've always wanted to ride with you, Log.

39
00:02:31,292 --> 00:02:36,250
You and me getting into it.
Deadpool and Wolverine just fuckin' shit up.

40
00:02:36,417 --> 00:02:39,583
Can you imagine the fun, the chaos...

41
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,708
the residuals?

42
00:02:41,917 --> 00:02:42,958
"G'day, mate.

43
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,792
"There's nothing that'll
bring me back to life faster...

44
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:47,417
"than a big bag of Marvel cash."

45
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,250
Me too, Hugh.

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,208
But, no. No, no, no.

47
00:02:54,792 --> 00:02:59,542
You had to get all noble and die for real.
Goddamn it!

48
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,333
I could really use your help right now.

49
00:03:14,417 --> 00:03:15,250
Wait!

50
00:03:16,417 --> 00:03:18,042
I'm warning you, I'm not alone.

51
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,667
Wade Winston Wilson...

52
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:23,125
you are under arrest
by the Time Variance Authority...

53
00:03:23,292 --> 00:03:25,125
for too many crimes to list.

54
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:26,125
Come out...

55
00:03:26,292 --> 00:03:27,625
and we'll extend you the courtesy...

56
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:29,875
- of taking you in one piece.
- Death by day-player.

57
00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:30,958
Last chance.

58
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:34,167
Throw out your weapons
and come out peacefully.

59
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:36,625
I'm not gonna give you my weapons...

60
00:03:36,792 --> 00:03:38,833
but I promise not to use them.

61
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,500
There are two hundred and six bones
in the human body.

62
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:44,833
Two hundred and seven
if I'm watching <i>Gossip Girl.</i>

63
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,750
Here we go. Maximum effort.

64
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,833
Okay, peanut.
Guess we're getting that team up after all.

65
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,667
Maradona from outside the box!

66
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,208
{\an8}Goal!

67
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,083
Come on, big fella.

68
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:42,583
I am soaking wet right now.

69
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,875
<i>To be clear, I'm not proud of any of this.</i>

70
00:06:48,042 --> 00:06:51,917
<i>The wanton violence,
the whiff of necrophilia. It isn't who I am.</i>

71
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,417
<i>It isn't who I wanna be.</i>

72
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:54,833
<i>Who I wanna be?</i>

73
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,583
<i>Well, to help you understand that...</i>

74
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,792
<i>I've gotta take you back.</i>

75
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:00,542
<i>A little joyride I took
through space and time...</i>

76
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:03,250
<i>to the day that changed everything.</i>

77
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,000
{\an8}I can't believe I'm finally here.

78
00:07:17,167 --> 00:07:19,708
{\an8}I've waited for this moment for so long.

79
00:07:21,042 --> 00:07:23,167
Thank you, sir, for seeing me.

80
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,125
I firmly believe...

81
00:07:26,292 --> 00:07:27,583
that my services could be of...

82
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,500
great use to your organization.
Now I know...

83
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:32,958
I was caught smashturbating
in the lobby of Stark Tower...

84
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,333
- but I can assure you that...
- Smashturbating?

85
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,750
I'm sorry, what, what was that?

86
00:07:35,917 --> 00:07:39,125
No, I'm sorry.
That, that's when you get those toy...

87
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,958
Hulk hands, right? And then you just,
you look down, and you just...

88
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:45,875
you brace yourself,
and you ravage the midsection.

89
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:47,542
- Pinch the... Yeah. Okay.
- I get it. Okay, thank you.

90
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,583
- The picture's painted.
- You get the gist.

91
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,917
What exactly brings you here today?

92
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,792
Why am I... Wow. Okay.

93
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,833
I care.

94
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:59,542
I know I turn everything into a joke,
but I...

95
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:04,250
I care, and I, I wanna use that feeling...

96
00:08:05,292 --> 00:08:07,167
for something important.

97
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:08,917
I, I wanna matter.

98
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,542
I need to show my girl that I matter.

99
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:15,917
And...

100
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,625
you know,
I feel like I'm wasting the good stuff here.

101
00:08:18,792 --> 00:08:20,708
- Is the man not gonna be joining us?
- The man?

102
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,000
Yeah. I should save this if he's gonna...

103
00:08:23,542 --> 00:08:25,417
As, as far as you're concerned right now,
I'm the man.

104
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:26,708
- No.
- The man is me.

105
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:30,083
I am the man in this circumstance.

106
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:32,875
He doesn't do this kind of thing anymore.

107
00:08:33,042 --> 00:08:33,875
- Cameos?
- Meetings.

108
00:08:34,042 --> 00:08:35,582
- Meetings.
- Entry-level meetings.

109
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,542
Entry-level?

110
00:08:36,707 --> 00:08:38,542
Aren't you the chauffeur...

111
00:08:38,707 --> 00:08:40,707
- maybe?
- I... Common misconception.

112
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,957
- Okay.
- I did begin my career as Mr. Stark's driver.

113
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,125
- Okay.
- Quickly pivoted to...

114
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:46,667
- Chauffeur.
- ...the Head of Security.

115
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,667
The Head of... Of course, yes, yes, yes.

116
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:51,708
And why I am vetting your résumé.

117
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,958
You seem to have left out
whether or not you had...

118
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,625
any experience as a member of a team.

119
00:08:55,792 --> 00:08:58,000
Could you maybe
add a little bit of perspective there?

120
00:08:58,167 --> 00:09:00,333
No, yes, of course. I was Special Forces...

121
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,000
- Okay.
- but I was... Mainly, I was team leader...

122
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,250
founder, really, of X-Force.

123
00:09:04,417 --> 00:09:06,333
Sadly, they,
they all perished in action though.

124
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,792
How exactly did that happen?

125
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,833
Well, the police say gravity, but if...

126
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,833
Just between us...

127
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,583
- they didn't test well in the focus group.
- I see.

128
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,500
- Particularly Cable.
- X-Force.

129
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:16,542
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Look,
I can see this isn't going well.

130
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,083
Please stop writing. Look, I, I...

131
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,083
I'm just... I wanna be an Avenger.

132
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,583
I wanna be an Avenger.

133
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,875
Why do you wanna be an Avenger?

134
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:30,375
Look around you. I mean, they're the,
they're the best of the best.

135
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:32,333
And, and what they do matters.

136
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,750
I need to be an Avenger.

137
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:38,625
Sir, my girl has kinda had it with my shtick,
and I, if I don't, you know...

138
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:41,417
turn things around
and do something with my gifts...

139
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,125
I don't think it's gonna
really work out for me...

140
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:44,542
and I wouldn't blame her.

141
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:49,958
Avengers are a very unique group
of superheroes...

142
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,333
that stand for something...

143
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,083
more than just fighting and wearing costumes.

144
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,167
I mean, people look up to us.
Kids look up to us.

145
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,542
- They...
- I'm sorry. "Us?"

146
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:00,458
I wasn't aware that you were an Avenger.

147
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,708
- Avengers-adjacent, technically.
- Oh, wow.

148
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,917
What's your superpower?
Is it parallel parking? I am so sorry.

149
00:10:06,417 --> 00:10:07,667
That was cruel.

150
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,958
I lash out when I'm nervous.
Won't happen again.

151
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,417
- Let's cut to the chase.
- Please.

152
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,917
You just said moments ago...

153
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:17,000
that you wanted to be an Avenger
because you need it.

154
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,750
Yes, sir, I do.

155
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:21,750
But the Avengers don't do the job because
they need it.

156
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:23,833
They do the job because people need them.

157
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:26,458
Do you see the distinction?

158
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,708
Yes, sir.

159
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:32,083
Please, Mr. Hogan.

160
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,500
I don't wanna spend the rest of my life
like an annoying one-trick pony.

161
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,375
All right.

162
00:10:40,417 --> 00:10:42,000
Oh, my God, you're standing.

163
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:43,500
Yeah, now's the time that we stand.

164
00:10:43,667 --> 00:10:44,500
Damn it.

165
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:46,125
Now, the problem might be that you're...

166
00:10:46,292 --> 00:10:48,542
reaching a little, little too high.

167
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:51,125
Aim for the middle, and you'll never miss.

168
00:10:51,292 --> 00:10:53,458
Right? I think you got a good heart.
I believe what you're saying.

169
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:57,500
But not everybody's the world-saving type.
I'm not, and I'm happy.

170
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,917
Right? I found my place.

171
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,000
Find your place.

172
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,583
- All right? Get back out there.
- Mm-hmm.

173
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:08,167
- We'll keep an eye on you. Good luck.
- Okay.

174
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,625
Fetch the car. I wanna hit Shake Shack.

175
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,833
Rejection makes me hungy.

176
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:18,208
- Really? No?
- No, no. Please.

177
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,958
- Yeah, no, no, no. Okay, thank you.
- Oh, okay.

178
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:26,250
<i>You know what they say.
When one door closes...</i>

179
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:28,625
<i>your locker at work opens.</i>

180
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:42,000
Now let's go sell some certified
pre-owned vehicles, motherfu...

181
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:47,417
Technically, the,
the Carnival's not a minivan.

182
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:49,667
It's an MPV.

183
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,417
So how does the Kia compare to...

184
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:52,875
- the Honda Odyssey?
- The Odyssey?

185
00:11:53,042 --> 00:11:55,583
That's a great question.
It doesn't fucking suck.

186
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,458
You know, you can answer
the question without swearing.

187
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,542
I'm sorry, Tammy, I don't, I don't have kids.

188
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,833
Not that I haven't dreamt of that...

189
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,042
but I don't have a lot of vaginal sex.

190
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:09,917
{\an8}You'll get 'em next time, pal.

191
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,542
And look,
you can always go back to superhero-ing.

192
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,583
I mean,
I know I'd like to see you back in the suit.

193
00:12:15,292 --> 00:12:17,708
I don't keep it in my locker
so that I can wear it.

194
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,625
I keep it in my locker in case
we need to saddle up again.

195
00:12:20,792 --> 00:12:23,667
Hey, hey, hey. What?
What is that doing in there?

196
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,833
I'm done.

197
00:12:26,542 --> 00:12:27,542
I'm done.

198
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:30,542
And I'm fine with being done.

199
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,208
Look, is sales the best match?

200
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,208
Probably not.

201
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:36,750
Is this the life that
I always imagined for myself? Fuck no.

202
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:40,333
But this is the right fit for me,
Sugar Bear, it is.

203
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,042
Okay, Mr. Wilson.

204
00:12:42,417 --> 00:12:46,167
I'm just saying, once a month,
we could go on a little mission.

205
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,833
We're human beings. We crave purpose.

206
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,667
After all, we're Deadpool.

207
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:54,792
Please stop saying that. We're not Deadpool.
I'm not even Deadpool anymore.

208
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,583
Well, if you're gonna have a midlife crisis,
go big.

209
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,750
A few years ago...

210
00:12:59,917 --> 00:13:02,917
a friend of mine got his nipples pierced
with a titanium chain...

211
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,042
that goes down
and attaches to his Van Johnson.

212
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:13,208
Are, are you feeling grumplestiltskin
'cause it's your birthday?

213
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:16,042
What?

214
00:13:17,042 --> 00:13:17,875
No.

215
00:13:19,042 --> 00:13:19,875
No.

216
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,250
Surprise!

217
00:13:25,542 --> 00:13:27,917
Hey, you guys are lucky I'm not armed.

218
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:29,750
Get in here.

219
00:13:29,917 --> 00:13:32,167
If this were six years ago,
you'd all be dead.

220
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:35,125
So then, he gets out of the cab,
and you will not believe it.

221
00:13:35,292 --> 00:13:37,625
- I turn around, and what do I find?
- AirPods.

222
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:39,083
- His AirPods. Come on.
- His AirPods!

223
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,167
Crazy story.

224
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,708
- Every time. Come on.
- Every single time.

225
00:13:44,792 --> 00:13:46,208
Make any sales today?

226
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:47,750
You know I didn't.

227
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:51,042
Did you sell any dreamcatchers on Etsy
or whatever it is that you do?

228
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,667
Our rent's due in three days, Wade.

229
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,083
I can't keep carrying you.

230
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,875
Relax. I have the money.

231
00:13:56,042 --> 00:13:59,458
I sold some old blood pressure medication
I found lying around.

232
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,208
You tryin' to kill me, motherfucker?

233
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,500
I'm not the one dousing everything in salt, motherfucker.

234
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:05,708
I pray every day that...

235
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,542
fire finds your body...

236
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,083
and finishes the job...

237
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,708
- God didn't have the nuts to do.
- That's hurtful.

238
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,708
If you could hear the look on my face,
you'd smell how sad I am.

239
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,000
You watched anything good?

240
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:17,750
<i>Great British Bake Off.</i>

241
00:14:17,917 --> 00:14:19,208
Oh, goddamn.

242
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,708
That show stood between me and suicide
for ten years.

243
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,250
Those are my feelings
on abortion, religious freedom...

244
00:14:24,417 --> 00:14:26,500
animal rights, privacy rights, vaccines...

245
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:28,875
free-market capitalism,
global climate change.

246
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:31,167
Yeah, duh-duh-duh.
No, no speaking lines, Buck.

247
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,708
Hi, Yukio.

248
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:33,792
Hi, Wade.

249
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,667
Nice fake o'clock shadow.

250
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,917
It's a summer balayage. From the French.

251
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:43,250
It's meant to mimic the
natural highlights of the sun.

252
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:45,125
- It's a toupée.
- It's a hair system.

253
00:14:45,292 --> 00:14:48,542
- I love your hair system, Wade.
- Thank you.

254
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,542
Wanna do some cocaine?

255
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:53,667
Hey, cocaine is the one thing
that Feige said is off limits.

256
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,500
- What about Bolivian marching powder?
- They know all the slang terms.

257
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:57,625
They have a list.

258
00:14:57,792 --> 00:14:59,458
- Even snowboarding?
- Even disco dust.

259
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,208
- White girl interrupted?
- Even Forrest Bump.

260
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,250
- Booger sugar?
- I wouldn't even try powdered gonuts.

261
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:06,875
- You wanna build a snowman?
- Yes. But I can't.

262
00:15:08,417 --> 00:15:09,250
Pull here.

263
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:10,917
- Here?
- Yeah.

264
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:13,792
- What happened?
- That's the fun part.

265
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,333
Thanks for coming.

266
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,417
Yeah.

267
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,583
How's work?

268
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,083
Oh, I got a promotion.

269
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:21,958
No way.

270
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:25,333
Yeah. It's mind-numbing middle management,
but I'm happy.

271
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,542
That's great.

272
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,833
- You seeing anyone?
- How about you?

273
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,333
Yeah.

274
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:35,375
A guy from work. Dermot.

275
00:15:35,542 --> 00:15:36,583
Dermot.

276
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,083
- He's kind.
- Good.

277
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,750
Likes to go hiking.

278
00:15:39,917 --> 00:15:41,292
Hasn't gotten me shot yet.

279
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,583
Well, it's early days.

280
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,458
What about you? You seeing anyone?

281
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,833
No, no, I live in a one-bedroom apartment.
I share a bed with Blind Al.

282
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,750
- Okay. All right.
- All right.

283
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:03,667
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

284
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,375
- Speech! Speech!
- Yes!

285
00:16:05,542 --> 00:16:07,333
All right. Okay, okay, okay.

286
00:16:08,292 --> 00:16:09,292
Birthdays.

287
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:12,125
Boy, every spin around the moon
is a new adventure indeed.

288
00:16:12,292 --> 00:16:14,333
- Sun, dumbass.
- Okay, round-earther.

289
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,917
- Where was I?
- The adventure of life.

290
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,083
Right.

291
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,708
It's been a challenging few years.

292
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,750
Haven't seen you guys in a while.

293
00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:25,000
Been through a lot, change of life.

294
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:27,083
- Menopause?
- Bitch, are you improv-ing?

295
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,833
- Mm-mm.
- Sorry.

296
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:31,167
I'm sorry that you had to see that, Yukio.

297
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,417
It's okay.

298
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:35,750
But I'm happy.

299
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:37,417
You know, and that's, that's...

300
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:40,375
because of each and every one of you.

301
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,208
I guess, what I'm trying to say is...

302
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,750
how proud I am, how grateful I am...

303
00:16:43,917 --> 00:16:45,167
to be standing in a room...

304
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:48,000
with every single person I love.

305
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,208
I'm the luckiest man alive.

306
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:58,792
Make a wish, buddy.

307
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,292
Ten-four, good buddy.

308
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,625
Going down.

309
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,875
Wade Wilson?

310
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,958
Oh, yeah. Dancers.
Dopinder must have ordered you.

311
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:14,791
Are those supposed to be cop costumes?

312
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,125
Never mind.

313
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:20,125
Take your clothes off but leave the helmets.
And this isn't <i>Pretty Woman.</i>

314
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,375
We're kissing. All right?

315
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,166
What song do you guys normally dance to?

316
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:28,375
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

317
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:29,875
Is that supposed to be scary?

318
00:17:30,042 --> 00:17:33,667
Pegging isn't new for me, friendo.
But it is for Disney.

319
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:34,917
Ah, ta, ta, ta!

320
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:39,042
Okay, I've never been a natural bottom,
so we're gonna take things real slow.

321
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,083
And I want some crazy eye contact.

322
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,292
Not you.
You.

323
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,542
Can't see your eyes through the mask,
but I can feel them.

324
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,292
We're gonna move on down the hallway...

325
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:49,625
so we can spare a cleanup on aisle asshole.
How does everyone feel about this plan?

326
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:52,750
- I don't like you.
- Yes. Let's hold on to that attitude.

327
00:17:52,917 --> 00:17:54,625
And we're gonna do it angry.

328
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,917
Mr. Wilson...

329
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,708
you appear to have soiled yourself
while unconscious.

330
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,125
I wasn't unconscious. Who are you?

331
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,250
I go by the name of Paradox.

332
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:26,833
Mr. Paradox.
And you're sitting here at the TVA.

333
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
The Time Variance Authority.

334
00:18:29,167 --> 00:18:31,417
We're really a watchdog organization...

335
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:35,292
except we're more lighthearted
than that sounds with a sort of...

336
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,542
throwback, ironic twist.

337
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:41,917
And we're in charge of defending
what's known as the Sacred Timeline.

338
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:45,250
Holy fuck. That is a shit-ton of exposition
for a threequel.

339
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:47,292
Is this because I used Cable's time machine?

340
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:50,083
Brought a couple of people back to life,
then I destroyed it.

341
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,625
- That was a long time ago.
- Yes...

342
00:18:51,792 --> 00:18:54,458
we're aware of your abuse of your timeline.

343
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,750
And you were so abusive of it.

344
00:18:57,542 --> 00:18:59,417
No, it has nothing to do with that.

345
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:00,667
Walk with me.

346
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:10,750
I brought you here, Mr. Wilson,
to tell you that you're special.

347
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,375
In fact,
you've been chosen for a higher purpose...

348
00:19:14,542 --> 00:19:16,250
a purpose unclear even to me.

349
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:18,708
But one that could...

350
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,792
save the entire Sacred Timeline...

351
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:24,542
from a possibly grisly fate
sometime in the future...

352
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:29,000
which may very well need to be... avenged.

353
00:19:29,292 --> 00:19:30,667
This Sacred Timeline...

354
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,667
I assume I'm going to marvel...

355
00:19:34,167 --> 00:19:35,208
at how...

356
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,625
cinematic it feels?

357
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:39,792
Gratuitous cameos...

358
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,792
indiscriminate use of Variants,
the whole package?

359
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,083
Well, you tell me.

360
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:51,708
Cap!

361
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,458
You are no longer lost, Wade.

362
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:04,083
You can be a hero among heroes.

363
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,792
We've been surveilling you for quite a while.

364
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:09,708
- Subway station.
- A TVA outpost, yes.

365
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:12,042
- And what is that?
- Hmm?

366
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,458
Is that me? Is that Thor?

367
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,167
Is he crying?

368
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,125
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

369
00:20:21,292 --> 00:20:22,625
That happens in the distant future.

370
00:20:22,792 --> 00:20:25,000
- Why is Thor crying? Quick! Tell me.
- Do not speak to her.

371
00:20:25,167 --> 00:20:26,000
Stop that. Eyes on me.

372
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:28,375
I brought you here
to offer you an opportunity.

373
00:20:28,542 --> 00:20:31,792
The opportunity you sought years ago,
but for which you were not ready.

374
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:33,583
We believe you're ready now.

375
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,625
Ready for a chance to leave your timeline...

376
00:20:35,792 --> 00:20:38,125
and join the greatest universe of all.

377
00:20:38,292 --> 00:20:39,833
I am about to give you the thing
you've always wanted.

378
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,542
Oh, I smell what you're steppin' in.

379
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,125
The power in the Marvel Universe
is about to change forever.

380
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,167
I am the Messiah...

381
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,125
I am...

382
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:54,958
Marvel Jesus.

383
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:59,083
Can you excuse me for just a moment?
I'm just gonna go over here.

384
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,875
Suck it, Fox!

385
00:21:04,042 --> 00:21:05,333
I'm going to Disneyland.

386
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:06,750
Get fucked!

387
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,458
- Where do I sign?
- Oh, there's no need for paperwork.

388
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,833
Good. Not to brag, but I do not read.

389
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,917
- Oh.
- There is one thing I will need, though.

390
00:21:22,417 --> 00:21:24,500
Oh, fuck off!

391
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:26,625
Adorn me, Beardo.

392
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,208
Fuckin' A!

393
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,083
It's perfect! FYI...

394
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,083
your tailor is a predator,
but I love it. Snug.

395
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:58,625
No camel toe.
New car smell and adamantium katanas?

396
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,458
You shouldn't have.

397
00:22:00,792 --> 00:22:02,917
Go ahead. Take it in.

398
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:05,583
And yes, your underwear is getting tighter.

399
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,375
That guy knows what I'm talking about.

400
00:22:07,542 --> 00:22:09,042
His clothes says middle management...

401
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,667
but his eyes say fuck-y fuck-y.

402
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,500
Yes. You look very nice.

403
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:16,708
"Nice?" Your buddy here is ready to
throw it all away for me.

404
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:18,083
- You callin' your wife?
- HR.

405
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,417
Does your wife work in HR?

406
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:21,667
I'm really glad you're taking this so well.

407
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,792
Oh. I'm taking it well.

408
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:26,917
I have never had a problem
traveling for work. That said...

409
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,250
we should talk vacation days.

410
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:31,042
I'm more of a
one-week-on-one-week-off kind of guy.

411
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:32,542
I think it's what they do in Denmark.

412
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:35,167
You know, you'll never see a
Danish flag on the moon, but...

413
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:36,417
goddamn it, they're happy.

414
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:39,083
Now, let's power up your little
Amazon Fire phone there...

415
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:42,458
and zip me back home so I can let my friends
know that they've been upgraded...

416
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:43,667
to disciples.

417
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:46,833
Yeah. I don't think you... quite understand.

418
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:51,875
You will not be returning to your home
because there will be no home to return to.

419
00:22:52,042 --> 00:22:52,875
Come again?

420
00:22:53,042 --> 00:22:54,083
This time in my ears.

421
00:22:58,458 --> 00:23:01,375
This is your universe, Mr. Wilson.

422
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,250
That...

423
00:23:03,417 --> 00:23:07,500
is what happens when a universe
loses their Anchor Being.

424
00:23:07,667 --> 00:23:09,750
See how it decays from the inside?

425
00:23:09,917 --> 00:23:12,583
- This is how a reality dies.
- What's an Anchor Being?

426
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:16,083
An Anchor Being is an entity of
such vital importance that when they die...

427
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:19,750
their whole world
slowly withers out of existence.

428
00:23:19,917 --> 00:23:22,542
You've just won the lottery
because I didn't die.

429
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:24,417
It was just a little midlife crisis.
I'm better now.

430
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:26,000
Oh, no, no, no.

431
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:33,417
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, I love to laugh.

432
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:36,292
Can you imagine if you were the Anchor Being?

433
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,750
- Yeah.
- No, it isn't you, Mr. Wilson.

434
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:45,875
Your Anchor Being died
in an act of self-sacrifice so epic...

435
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:48,417
that it sent shivers down the Timeline.

436
00:23:48,792 --> 00:23:51,625
I am referring, of course, to...

437
00:23:53,042 --> 00:23:56,750
Logan. The Wolverine.

438
00:24:00,292 --> 00:24:02,625
<i>Don't be what they made you.</i>

439
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,167
<i>So this is what it feels like...</i>

440
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Logan.

441
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:19,917
Of course.

442
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:21,500
Logan.

443
00:24:24,417 --> 00:24:25,708
Logan?

444
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:27,833
The guy with forks for hands?

445
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,250
That Wolverine?

446
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:34,667
Yeah, I got it. You can turn your retro
graphics of death off now. Make it stop.

447
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:37,292
We're not doing it, Mr. Wilson.
We certainly can't stop it.

448
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:40,667
How long have we got?

449
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:43,167
In most cases, couple thousand years.

450
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:45,333
- Well, sweet.
- Well, most cases aren't fast enough.

451
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,458
Not for me.

452
00:24:47,042 --> 00:24:48,042
What does that mean?

453
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:50,292
It means that I have been tasked...

454
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:52,708
with overseeing the end of your universe.

455
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:55,500
And regardless of what the
pencil pushers upstairs would prefer...

456
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:56,792
I will not...

457
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:00,542
waste my life watching it die slowly
of natural causes.

458
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,875
We used to just prune these things. Simple.

459
00:25:03,042 --> 00:25:04,750
Elegant. Efficient. But I'm told the TVA...

460
00:25:04,917 --> 00:25:07,167
doesn't like to do that anymore.
Well I do.

461
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:09,667
And no matter what my so-called
superiors say, the multiverse...

462
00:25:09,833 --> 00:25:11,500
does not need a babysitter.

463
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:13,458
We need a mercy killer.

464
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:15,042
And in this instance...

465
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:17,625
I am the mercy killer.

466
00:25:22,708 --> 00:25:24,625
What in the MacGuffin is that?

467
00:25:24,792 --> 00:25:26,958
That's a Time Ripper, Mr. Wilson.

468
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:28,667
An accelerant.

469
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:33,417
Once completed, it will allow me to destroy
the spacetime matrix of your universe.

470
00:25:33,583 --> 00:25:35,583
You see, I don't want to work for the TVA.

471
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,833
I want to be the TVA.

472
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,542
And the first step involves
showing this organization...

473
00:25:40,708 --> 00:25:42,375
how much more efficient it can become.

474
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:46,833
To wit, I will be giving your universe
a swift and compassionate end.

475
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,417
And don't worry,
your friends won't feel a thing.

476
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:50,375
It'll be over just like this.
"Oh, what's that?"

477
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,833
Trust me.

478
00:26:05,542 --> 00:26:07,708
You're gonna Old Yeller my fucking universe?

479
00:26:07,875 --> 00:26:10,083
Mm... In your parlance, yes.

480
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,292
Two in the heart, one in the head.

481
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:13,667
Look, Mr. Wilson, you have two choices.

482
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:17,042
You can either rejoin your loved ones
and collectively cease to exist in...

483
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:20,042
I'd say, seventy-two hours. Or...

484
00:26:20,208 --> 00:26:22,750
you join the Sacred Timeline.

485
00:26:22,917 --> 00:26:25,167
And you end your days of
insignificance...

486
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,250
and mediocrity.

487
00:26:27,417 --> 00:26:28,333
Wade.

488
00:26:29,042 --> 00:26:30,750
Wade, you can finally...

489
00:26:30,917 --> 00:26:33,333
finally, matter.

490
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:45,125
That's all I've ever really wanted.

491
00:26:45,292 --> 00:26:46,542
I know.

492
00:26:47,167 --> 00:26:48,167
I know.

493
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:52,625
And you know I'm,
I'm nothing if not morally flexible.

494
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:56,083
Yep, yep.

495
00:26:58,417 --> 00:26:59,417
I'll do it.

496
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:02,000
Wise choice.
The Sacred Timeline's happy to have you.

497
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:04,000
I was actually talking about
finding the Wolverine...

498
00:27:04,167 --> 00:27:05,250
and breaking your fucking nose.

499
00:27:19,083 --> 00:27:21,417
Find him. Find him!

500
00:27:21,583 --> 00:27:23,333
<i>And boy, did he ever.</i>

501
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:26,625
<i>Which brings us back to this.</i>

502
00:27:28,792 --> 00:27:30,750
<i>The desecration of the sacred corpse.</i>

503
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:36,292
Oh, my God!

504
00:27:37,708 --> 00:27:40,333
Oh! My own fucking arm!

505
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:45,542
Now we're talkin'!

506
00:27:45,667 --> 00:27:46,958
Not like this!

507
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:49,083
No, dear God! No!

508
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,417
I'm sorry! Wolverine-ing is hard!

509
00:27:51,583 --> 00:27:52,583
Make it stop!

510
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,500
Mangold tried.

511
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,708
You sick fuck!

512
00:27:58,875 --> 00:28:00,042
Logan was a hero.

513
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:03,125
And the only thing worth a shit
to ever come out of Canada.

514
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:15,375
Get my country's name
out of your fuckin' mouth.

515
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,083
And my sword. Give me that.

516
00:28:21,542 --> 00:28:23,833
Oh, I gotta find me another Logan.

517
00:28:24,292 --> 00:28:25,583
An alive one.

518
00:28:25,833 --> 00:28:28,000
Don't get up, guys. I'll see myself out.

519
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:36,417
Logan!

520
00:28:40,167 --> 00:28:41,792
I'm gonna need you to come with me.

521
00:28:43,083 --> 00:28:44,083
Who's asking?

522
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,292
Oh, look at this little Hairy Lou Retton.

523
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:50,042
Did you stick the landing, little guy?

524
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:51,542
Yes, you did!

525
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:53,625
Comic accurate short king.

526
00:28:53,792 --> 00:28:55,875
Such a cute wittle Wolvie.

527
00:28:56,042 --> 00:28:57,750
Cue the fuckin' montage, baby.

528
00:28:58,375 --> 00:29:01,417
Ahoy! Everything seems to be on fire.

529
00:29:01,583 --> 00:29:02,667
You have a dragon?

530
00:29:03,417 --> 00:29:06,333
You have Anchor Being written all over...

531
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:16,667
Patch!

532
00:29:18,708 --> 00:29:19,958
Now we're talkin'.

533
00:29:20,583 --> 00:29:21,875
Oh, yeah.

534
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,417
That's the whole goddamn package right there.

535
00:29:25,417 --> 00:29:26,500
Howdy!

536
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:29,167
I'm just... I'm auditioning Anchor Beings.

537
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:31,875
Oh. Yeah, that's gonna need some coconut oil.

538
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,083
What in the fuck?

539
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,000
Are you okay?

540
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,542
Oh, yes, yes.

541
00:29:41,708 --> 00:29:43,542
Classic John Byrne brown and tan.

542
00:29:43,708 --> 00:29:45,667
Now, you fought the Hulk in this outfit. No?

543
00:29:48,542 --> 00:29:50,250
I'm Marvel Jesus, you dull creature,
and I will not...

544
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:03,667
It's not you. We're just going
in a different direction.

545
00:30:06,958 --> 00:30:09,083
You know, from behind,
you look a little bit like Henry...

546
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,458
Oh, my fuck!

547
00:30:10,792 --> 00:30:13,500
The Cavillrine. The legends are true.

548
00:30:14,167 --> 00:30:16,917
And may I say, sir,
on behalf of all humanity...

549
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:18,792
this just feels right.

550
00:30:18,958 --> 00:30:22,042
We will treat you so much better
than those shit fucks down the street.

551
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,250
You were just leavin'.

552
00:30:23,417 --> 00:30:25,583
No, sir.
Not while the fate of my universe is at...

553
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:31,875
This one looks promising.

554
00:30:32,042 --> 00:30:32,875
Down you go.

555
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:35,500
Again.

556
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:38,583
I told you. You're not welcome here.

557
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,167
You're not welcome anywhere.

558
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:41,542
Now get the fuck out of my bar.

559
00:30:41,708 --> 00:30:44,167
Just give me one more drink
and then I'll leave.

560
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:45,958
That's not how it works.

561
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:48,375
It does now. Leave the bottle.

562
00:30:48,542 --> 00:30:49,375
I know you, bub?

563
00:30:49,542 --> 00:30:51,625
Nope. But I know you.

564
00:30:52,042 --> 00:30:53,417
Everybody knows me.

565
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,167
I'm the Wolverine.

566
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:58,125
Yes, you are.

567
00:30:58,292 --> 00:31:00,583
And I'm gonna need you
to come with me right now.

568
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,375
Look, lady, I'm not interested.

569
00:31:03,542 --> 00:31:06,250
- Really gettin' into your cups here.
- Why would I go with you?

570
00:31:07,458 --> 00:31:09,292
Because, unfortunately...

571
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:10,375
I need you...

572
00:31:10,542 --> 00:31:14,625
and even more unfortunately,
my entire world needs you.

573
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:16,917
You two gonna fuck or fight?

574
00:31:20,875 --> 00:31:22,083
You gonna take that from him?

575
00:31:22,458 --> 00:31:23,292
Yep.

576
00:31:24,167 --> 00:31:25,208
I can tell you have a sort of...

577
00:31:25,375 --> 00:31:27,833
don't-get-too-close-I'll-only-
break-your-heart vibe going here...

578
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,250
but every other Wolverine
would've really hurt me by now.

579
00:31:30,417 --> 00:31:33,292
And, I'm sort of on the tick-tick.
So upsy-daisy. Here we go.

580
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:35,667
- Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey!
- Up you go. I got you, big guy.

581
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:40,208
Whiskey dick of the claws.

582
00:31:40,375 --> 00:31:42,833
- It's quite common in Wolverines over forty.
- You don't want this.

583
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,542
You're right. I don't.
And you don't want this.

584
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:48,333
Unless you wanna take a deep breath
through your fuckin' forehead...

585
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,375
I suggest you reconsider.

586
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:51,625
Let's go, peanut.

587
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:58,000
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

588
00:31:58,708 --> 00:31:59,542
Watch this.

589
00:32:00,667 --> 00:32:02,708
All right. That... Whoa.

590
00:32:03,375 --> 00:32:04,208
Easy.

591
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,833
Good God.

592
00:32:09,583 --> 00:32:11,333
Thirsty little honey badger, aren't ya?

593
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,042
It's okay. Keep goin'.

594
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:16,042
Audiences are accustomed to long run times.

595
00:32:22,083 --> 00:32:23,542
Guess you'll have to do.

596
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Okay, here we...

597
00:32:26,208 --> 00:32:28,542
Oh! Look at those jammies.

598
00:32:28,958 --> 00:32:32,208
That only took twenty fucking years.

599
00:32:32,625 --> 00:32:34,583
One Anchor Being coming right up!

600
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,833
On your left, baby girl.

601
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:40,458
This Logan has the same
he-can-do-anything-even-musicals look.

602
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:41,625
And bonus...

603
00:32:41,792 --> 00:32:43,083
he's actually wearing a costume...

604
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,958
like he's not embarrassed to be in
a superhero movie for once.

605
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:46,458
I don't understand.

606
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:48,042
You said my universe is dying...

607
00:32:48,208 --> 00:32:50,625
because this sack of nuts
got himself killed.

608
00:32:50,792 --> 00:32:53,333
- Well, problem solved.
- My God.

609
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:57,500
You actually think
you can replace an Anchor Being...

610
00:32:57,667 --> 00:32:59,083
with this?

611
00:32:59,917 --> 00:33:02,958
I wouldn't have accepted any other Wolverine
BT dubs. But you...

612
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:06,542
have outdone yourself
and brought me the worst Wolverine!

613
00:33:06,708 --> 00:33:07,667
What do you mean, the worst one?

614
00:33:07,833 --> 00:33:08,792
Mr. Wilson.

615
00:33:09,458 --> 00:33:12,583
This Wolverine let down his entire world.

616
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:15,333
He's the stuff of legend,
but not in a good way.

617
00:33:15,708 --> 00:33:17,000
And what he did...

618
00:33:17,167 --> 00:33:18,375
well...

619
00:33:18,542 --> 00:33:20,667
some things are just beyond forgiveness.

620
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,083
Okay.

621
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:26,917
How do I... How do I make this right?
I'll do anything.

622
00:33:27,417 --> 00:33:30,375
I gave you a chance at greatness.

623
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:32,833
Because my superiors deemed you special.

624
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,500
Clearly not special in a good way.

625
00:33:34,667 --> 00:33:37,500
Apparently you have some
important future purpose to serve.

626
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:38,792
With Thor. He holds me.

627
00:33:38,958 --> 00:33:42,917
But, I did my duty.
I gave you the opportunity to be somebody.

628
00:33:43,083 --> 00:33:46,292
And instead of accepting my offering
with humility and gratitude...

629
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:47,292
you broke my nose.

630
00:33:47,667 --> 00:33:50,208
- It looks great.
- And you decimated dozens of my men...

631
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:52,000
with the exhumed corpse of a hero.

632
00:33:52,167 --> 00:33:54,208
Dishonoring not only his remains
but his memory.

633
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:55,417
What are you, the Internet?

634
00:33:55,583 --> 00:33:57,750
Your world is dying!

635
00:33:57,917 --> 00:33:58,917
Thank you very much.

636
00:33:59,417 --> 00:34:00,542
And there's no stopping it.

637
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:04,333
The humane thing to do...

638
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,375
is to make it quick.

639
00:34:05,542 --> 00:34:08,250
Is the thought of vaporizing my universe
making you peckish?

640
00:34:08,417 --> 00:34:09,458
I'm eating my feelings.

641
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:12,667
I'm about to lose everything that I've
ever cared about because that hairy...

642
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:14,583
thundercunt from down undercunt...

643
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:17,792
finally dies
and he's standing right behind me, isn't he?

644
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,792
Welcome to the MCU, by the way.

645
00:34:20,417 --> 00:34:21,833
You're joining at a bit of a low point.

646
00:34:22,667 --> 00:34:24,583
As for you, I wanna talk to your boss.

647
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:27,917
I want you to get him on the phone
and you tell him, her, or them...

648
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:30,208
that Marvel H. Christ isn't playing.

649
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:36,542
Holy shit.

650
00:34:37,417 --> 00:34:41,208
I just heard a symphony
of buttholes clenching all at once.

651
00:34:41,375 --> 00:34:42,250
You're off grid.

652
00:34:42,417 --> 00:34:44,750
Your bosses don't know what you sick fucks
are doing down here.

653
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:47,958
Well, I'll tell you what.
I have a black belt in Karen...

654
00:34:48,125 --> 00:34:49,417
And I'm gonna go upstairs...

655
00:34:49,583 --> 00:34:51,542
and I'm gonna tell 'em all about
you and your...

656
00:34:52,667 --> 00:34:54,292
Silence is nice, isn't it?

657
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:55,458
Where the fuck did he go?

658
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:57,333
To the trash heap. You'll fit right in.

659
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:01,417
That was close.

660
00:35:22,917 --> 00:35:24,792
Don't just stand there, you ape.

661
00:35:25,417 --> 00:35:26,458
Give me a hand up.

662
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,125
Nope. I'm actually okay.
Thank you very much...

663
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:33,500
Where the hell are we?

664
00:35:33,667 --> 00:35:36,208
I don't know. Looks kind of Mad Max-y.

665
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:38,250
But that would be IP infringement, right?

666
00:35:38,417 --> 00:35:39,583
Fucking jokes.

667
00:35:42,958 --> 00:35:44,333
Fuck! Fuck.

668
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,833
Were you even listening back there?

669
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,667
If we don't make it back to that
Mr. Paradox asshole...

670
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,167
everyone I know is gonna die.

671
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:52,000
Not my fuckin' problem.

672
00:35:52,167 --> 00:35:53,375
Oh, is that all you got?

673
00:35:54,417 --> 00:35:56,417
Is that what you said
when your world went to shit?

674
00:35:58,875 --> 00:35:59,708
Come again?

675
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:01,250
Yeah, I heard all about you.

676
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:03,833
How you screwed up everything.

677
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,667
You should be thankin' me
for pulling you out of that bed you shit in.

678
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:09,083
You back-stabbing son of a bitch!

679
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:16,542
Are you ready to be calm now?

680
00:36:23,667 --> 00:36:26,167
Rest in pieces, Fox.

681
00:36:40,917 --> 00:36:42,417
I don't want to fight you, peanut.

682
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:45,083
Doesn't matter what you did.

683
00:36:45,375 --> 00:36:46,417
I just need your help.

684
00:36:48,292 --> 00:36:49,875
I don't fuckin' care.

685
00:36:52,292 --> 00:36:53,125
Uh-oh.

686
00:36:58,625 --> 00:37:01,000
Fuck. This is gonna hurt.

687
00:37:05,167 --> 00:37:06,500
All right.

688
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:07,667
Fuck it.

689
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:10,458
Let's give the people what they came for.

690
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,000
Let's fuckin' go.

691
00:37:14,167 --> 00:37:16,167
Get your special sock out, nerds.

692
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:18,167
It's gonna get good.

693
00:38:11,167 --> 00:38:12,167
Gotcha!

694
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:19,583
Baby Knife!

695
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,292
Let's see you grow your fuckin' head back.

696
00:38:26,458 --> 00:38:28,500
Wait, wait, wait! I can fix it! I can fix it.

697
00:38:28,667 --> 00:38:30,458
- Fix what?
- Whatever it is that you did.

698
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:32,750
Whatever made you so bad.

699
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:37,042
Those, those pricks in the TVA.
You heard him.

700
00:38:38,292 --> 00:38:39,542
They have the power to end my universe...

701
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:42,792
but they also have the power to change yours.

702
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,583
We get back there...

703
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:48,792
and we can fix your world. Together.

704
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:51,208
I promise.

705
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:53,958
They can fix it.

706
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:56,333
Hey!

707
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,500
We fight each other, we lose.

708
00:38:58,667 --> 00:38:59,917
Dear God, it's him.

709
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:02,083
- Who?
- The one.

710
00:39:02,417 --> 00:39:04,792
The superhero equivalent
to comfort food, or Molly.

711
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:08,708
White guys' answer to all the
disappointments. And another A-lister.

712
00:39:09,375 --> 00:39:10,750
Fair warning, gorgeous.

713
00:39:10,917 --> 00:39:12,875
You're going to encounter
some indelicate language...

714
00:39:13,042 --> 00:39:15,375
a smidge of ass play,
but we've been prohibited...

715
00:39:15,542 --> 00:39:16,917
from using cocaine. On camera.

716
00:39:17,083 --> 00:39:17,917
They're coming.

717
00:39:18,167 --> 00:39:19,667
Who's "they?"

718
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:27,667
Oh, they're driving angry.

719
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,542
Now that's a superhero landing.

720
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,750
I got this.

721
00:40:07,417 --> 00:40:08,250
Stay close.

722
00:40:08,875 --> 00:40:09,750
Aye, aye, Cap'n.

723
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:12,292
You got this.

724
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:18,042
Cassandra is gonna be giddy
when she sees what we caught.

725
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,083
You can't run.

726
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:21,458
Everybody knows that.

727
00:40:21,625 --> 00:40:23,750
You see anyone runnin', dick for brains?

728
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:26,542
You're not gonna love what happens next.

729
00:40:26,708 --> 00:40:28,167
Oh. Oh, my God.

730
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:29,458
Oh, my God.

731
00:40:29,625 --> 00:40:31,833
- Oh, my God, he's gonna say it.
- Ah! Fuck.

732
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,125
- Oh, my God! He's gonna say it!
- Say what?

733
00:40:34,292 --> 00:40:35,292
Avengers, assemble...

734
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:36,708
- Flame on!
- I'm sorry, what now?

735
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:00,667
Fuck!

736
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,583
We don't know that guy.

737
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:07,625
We thought we did.

738
00:41:07,875 --> 00:41:09,292
I know you.

739
00:41:10,042 --> 00:41:10,875
Holy...

740
00:41:13,417 --> 00:41:14,458
Sabretooth.

741
00:41:15,167 --> 00:41:16,000
Your brother.

742
00:41:16,917 --> 00:41:18,875
Ready to die?

743
00:41:19,042 --> 00:41:21,292
Wait, wait, wait!
Time!

744
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,542
You look ridiculous.

745
00:41:23,792 --> 00:41:26,292
People have waited decades for this fight.

746
00:41:26,458 --> 00:41:28,125
It's not gonna be easy.
Baby Knife.

747
00:41:28,292 --> 00:41:30,042
Shoot the double, you take him down.

748
00:41:30,208 --> 00:41:32,208
Side control, then full mount...

749
00:41:32,375 --> 00:41:35,333
and you ground and pound
till he makes no sound because he's dead.

750
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,333
Shut the fuck up!

751
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,458
Oh, my God!

752
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:39,250
Okay. Good luck. I'm a huge fan.

753
00:41:52,292 --> 00:41:53,375
What is it, girl?

754
00:41:53,542 --> 00:41:54,667
Is there trouble at the well?

755
00:42:00,875 --> 00:42:01,792
Big trouble.

756
00:42:01,958 --> 00:42:03,542
Behold!

757
00:42:03,708 --> 00:42:06,583
The head of your precious queen...

758
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:07,750
Furiosa!

759
00:42:08,917 --> 00:42:10,583
I have the Wolverine!

760
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:13,833
I alone control her!

761
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,917
You come for me...

762
00:42:16,417 --> 00:42:18,792
you come for her.

763
00:42:20,542 --> 00:42:24,167
So sorry. I know it's pronounced "him."
I'm gender blind. It's my cross to bear.

764
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,292
Who's next?

765
00:42:25,667 --> 00:42:26,708
Toad!

766
00:42:26,875 --> 00:42:27,750
You're up.

767
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,542
- Uh-oh. Oh, holy...
- Fuck.

768
00:42:48,458 --> 00:42:50,417
God of Thunder.

769
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:55,625
How long was I asleep?

770
00:42:55,792 --> 00:42:57,583
Not all of you was asleep.

771
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:59,125
Don't bother.

772
00:42:59,292 --> 00:43:01,083
They're very thorough.

773
00:43:01,542 --> 00:43:03,583
If you know where we are, start talking.

774
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:05,333
You're in The Void.

775
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,250
Think of it as purgatory.

776
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:10,542
Reed called it a metaphysical junkyard.

777
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:13,833
Where anything useless goes
before it gets annihilated forever.

778
00:43:14,375 --> 00:43:18,375
And where the TVA sends people that don't
play nice with the rest of the multiverse.

779
00:43:18,542 --> 00:43:19,958
- Like you?
- And you.

780
00:43:20,125 --> 00:43:21,500
What does the annihilating?

781
00:43:22,083 --> 00:43:22,917
Alioth.

782
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:26,750
Alioth is in this thing?
From <i>Loki,</i> season one, episode five?

783
00:43:26,917 --> 00:43:28,833
Everyone here is on the run from Alioth.

784
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:30,958
Most don't make it.

785
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:32,417
There's a resistance, though.

786
00:43:33,208 --> 00:43:35,958
Other people like us that managed to survive.

787
00:43:36,292 --> 00:43:40,125
They're hidin' out in the borderlands,
trying to find a way the fuck outta here.

788
00:43:40,292 --> 00:43:41,625
Then that's where we go.

789
00:43:41,792 --> 00:43:43,500
"We?" Us? A team?

790
00:43:43,667 --> 00:43:45,458
The answer is yes.
Shake on it.

791
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:47,458
Fuck! You nicked it.

792
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,458
Just got the tip with
your little steak knife.

793
00:43:49,625 --> 00:43:51,583
These "others" can help us
get back to the TVA.

794
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:52,667
Make 'em fix things.

795
00:43:54,958 --> 00:43:55,958
Something funny, bub?

796
00:43:56,583 --> 00:43:58,292
She might have somethin' to say about that.

797
00:43:58,458 --> 00:43:59,417
Who's "she?"

798
00:44:00,708 --> 00:44:01,792
In The Void...

799
00:44:02,042 --> 00:44:03,708
you're either food for Alioth...

800
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,542
or you work for her.

801
00:45:18,875 --> 00:45:20,833
Huh. Paul Rudd finally aged.

802
00:45:21,958 --> 00:45:23,333
You must be this year's Juggernaut.

803
00:45:23,708 --> 00:45:25,250
- Thank you.
- I'd keep your voices down.

804
00:45:25,417 --> 00:45:26,542
She don't like the chatter.

805
00:45:26,708 --> 00:45:27,958
She's gonna love you.

806
00:45:44,083 --> 00:45:45,500
Is it... Is that Charles?

807
00:45:45,792 --> 00:45:47,958
Hey... Hey, Chuck! It's us!

808
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:49,292
That's not Chuck.

809
00:45:49,458 --> 00:45:50,583
Ah, shit.

810
00:45:52,042 --> 00:45:53,500
Oh, ableism. Great.

811
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:56,083
That's not gonna go over well
with the woke mob.

812
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:57,708
A Wolverine.

813
00:45:58,208 --> 00:46:00,500
I wondered when I'd get one of you.

814
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:02,417
You're one of Xavier's.

815
00:46:02,583 --> 00:46:04,042
You-You know him? You know Chuck?

816
00:46:04,208 --> 00:46:05,292
Oh, I knew him.

817
00:46:05,583 --> 00:46:07,083
We shared a womb.

818
00:46:07,292 --> 00:46:10,792
Tried to strangle the sly little fellow
with my umbilical cord.

819
00:46:10,958 --> 00:46:13,958
Amen. I've never loved roommates.
Mine's blind.

820
00:46:14,292 --> 00:46:15,667
Except she can see cocaine.

821
00:46:15,917 --> 00:46:17,417
For some... reason.

822
00:46:17,583 --> 00:46:20,292
You want to chime in, Your Majesty?
I'm dying here.

823
00:46:20,458 --> 00:46:21,583
Who are you?

824
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:24,458
Charles Xavier's twin, Cassandra Nova.

825
00:46:24,792 --> 00:46:26,167
- Bullshit!
- I was an anal birth.

826
00:46:27,042 --> 00:46:28,250
You two are cute.

827
00:46:29,167 --> 00:46:30,500
I have a good feeling about this.

828
00:46:33,542 --> 00:46:34,667
And I've been trying to catch...

829
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,542
this little firefly for years.

830
00:46:37,333 --> 00:46:38,917
Haven't I, Johnny?

831
00:46:39,083 --> 00:46:42,292
Aw... You picked the wrong time
to make new friends.

832
00:46:42,458 --> 00:46:44,792
Oh, Johnny told us all about you.

833
00:46:44,958 --> 00:46:46,250
- Maybe shut up now.
- Yeah, maybe don't...

834
00:46:46,417 --> 00:46:47,500
We're just talkin' here.

835
00:46:47,667 --> 00:46:50,833
Yeah, Johnny told us
you're a psychotic megalomaniacal asshole.

836
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:51,750
His words, not mine.

837
00:46:51,917 --> 00:46:54,292
Hellbent on domination and pain.

838
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,458
- You said all that about me?
- No!

839
00:46:57,625 --> 00:47:00,958
- No! I don't... I didn't say any of that!
- Sticks and stones, Johnny!

840
00:47:02,583 --> 00:47:04,583
Don't let her intimidate you.

841
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:06,333
It's like you said in the convoy.

842
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,333
This finger-lickin' dead-inside
pixie slab of...

843
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,208
third rate dime-store nut-milk...

844
00:47:11,375 --> 00:47:13,167
can eat your delicious cinnamon ring...

845
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:15,333
- and kick rocks all the way to bald hell.
- Okay.

846
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,333
I have never said any of those words...

847
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,542
- in my entire life!
- Ha! The modesty.

848
00:47:19,708 --> 00:47:22,583
People think I'm a shit talker.
But this guy...

849
00:47:22,958 --> 00:47:23,792
Next level.

850
00:47:23,958 --> 00:47:25,875
What? This... I... We...

851
00:47:26,042 --> 00:47:27,458
I don't even know what half of that means!

852
00:47:27,625 --> 00:47:30,125
- This... I... What? This...
- My hat's off to you, sir. Truly.

853
00:47:30,292 --> 00:47:31,500
I didn't... He's... That's...

854
00:47:32,292 --> 00:47:33,375
I don't...

855
00:47:38,917 --> 00:47:39,833
Not my favorite Chris.

856
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,500
You stupid piece of shit.
You just got him fucking killed!

857
00:47:42,667 --> 00:47:44,417
Hey! We're all grieving!

858
00:47:44,583 --> 00:47:46,625
PS, do you know what
he was doing to the budget?

859
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:51,167
Alioth is hungry.

860
00:47:52,083 --> 00:47:53,667
There's been some kind of mistake.

861
00:47:53,833 --> 00:47:55,542
Big yellow is a back up Anchor Being...

862
00:47:55,708 --> 00:47:58,125
and I'm Marvel Jesus. MJ, if you're nasty.

863
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,333
This may be hard to hear...

864
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:02,167
but there's another British villain
who's gonna destroy my universe...

865
00:48:02,333 --> 00:48:03,333
and I'm gonna stop him.

866
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,375
Oh, honey, you don't really strike me as
the world-saving type.

867
00:48:08,917 --> 00:48:09,875
Did I hit a nerve?

868
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:12,250
I didn't want it to come to this.

869
00:48:13,125 --> 00:48:14,042
Either you help us...

870
00:48:14,208 --> 00:48:17,167
or my friend here is gonna sing
the entire second act of <i>Music Man...</i>

871
00:48:17,333 --> 00:48:18,500
with zero warm-up.

872
00:48:19,375 --> 00:48:20,583
Where'd you get the chair?

873
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:23,250
Well, once in a while,
I do get a Charles through here.

874
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:25,042
Never mine, though.

875
00:48:25,208 --> 00:48:28,375
No. He didn't care to find me.

876
00:48:29,542 --> 00:48:32,042
Gen Z and their trauma-bragging!

877
00:48:32,208 --> 00:48:34,750
Can't you just stuff it down,
turn it into accomplishment...

878
00:48:34,917 --> 00:48:36,542
or cancer like the rest of us?

879
00:48:36,708 --> 00:48:38,375
But I'm not like the rest of you.

880
00:48:38,542 --> 00:48:40,292
Except maybe the Wolverine.

881
00:48:40,458 --> 00:48:42,917
Now, we could be truly terrifying together.

882
00:48:43,083 --> 00:48:44,333
You're that scary, huh?

883
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,333
The TVA certainly thought so.

884
00:48:46,917 --> 00:48:49,042
They sent me here before I could walk.

885
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,167
And you know, it's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

886
00:48:52,625 --> 00:48:53,542
I love it here.

887
00:48:53,708 --> 00:48:55,167
You live in a garbage dump.

888
00:48:55,333 --> 00:48:58,083
I think we both know who lives
in the garbage dump.

889
00:48:58,458 --> 00:48:59,917
The Void is a paradise.

890
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:04,083
I can wield my power here without shame.

891
00:49:04,458 --> 00:49:07,750
Unfortunately I had no Charles Xavier
to teach me temperance.

892
00:49:08,458 --> 00:49:10,292
What about your Charles?

893
00:49:10,458 --> 00:49:11,583
Did he protect you?

894
00:49:12,375 --> 00:49:14,458
Did he make you feel safe?

895
00:49:14,625 --> 00:49:16,542
We're mutants. We're never safe.

896
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:26,833
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I don't... I don't want the smoke.

897
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:30,125
I don't have any beef with you.
I just want to save my friends.

898
00:49:30,292 --> 00:49:31,625
I just... I want to go home.

899
00:49:31,792 --> 00:49:33,458
Well, the thing is, I could get you home.

900
00:49:33,625 --> 00:49:35,208
- Good.
- But I don't want to.

901
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:36,667
Not good.

902
00:49:39,833 --> 00:49:42,125
What do you want, Wade Wilson?

903
00:49:42,625 --> 00:49:46,000
Your... fingers are inside me,
but not in a good way.

904
00:49:46,167 --> 00:49:49,125
My brother could
enter one's mind with a thought.

905
00:49:49,292 --> 00:49:51,625
I have to get my hands dirty.

906
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,833
I've got you.

907
00:49:58,250 --> 00:49:59,375
<i>I've got you...</i>

908
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:02,917
<i>What do you mean?</i>

909
00:50:05,083 --> 00:50:07,500
I can't, I can't reach you. You're not here.

910
00:50:07,667 --> 00:50:09,083
I'm right here.

911
00:50:09,542 --> 00:50:12,375
- No, you're not. I can't...
- I'm right here.

912
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:14,542
Then show me. You got to do something.

913
00:50:15,958 --> 00:50:16,833
Show you what?

914
00:50:17,417 --> 00:50:20,167
Show me you care about
something bigger than you.

915
00:50:21,292 --> 00:50:25,083
<i>Ever since they turned you down,
you took a knee.</i>

916
00:50:25,917 --> 00:50:27,875
Baby, you never got back up.

917
00:50:30,083 --> 00:50:33,667
I know you're going through something.
Let me go through it with you.

918
00:50:35,083 --> 00:50:37,083
- Your crazy matches my crazy.
- Your crazy matches my crazy.

919
00:50:40,708 --> 00:50:41,708
Where'd you go?

920
00:50:42,333 --> 00:50:43,667
Oh, my God.

921
00:50:46,667 --> 00:50:48,333
<i>You just say it. Okay?</i>

922
00:50:49,375 --> 00:50:50,208
<i>Say, "I don't want you.</i>

923
00:50:50,375 --> 00:50:51,667
<i>"I don't want to be with you."</i>

924
00:50:52,833 --> 00:50:54,167
<i>Go ahead. Say it. Say, say, "I don't..."</i>

925
00:50:54,333 --> 00:50:55,417
Say it. You don't wanna be with me.

926
00:50:55,875 --> 00:50:58,208
<i>Tell me that and I'll walk away.
Say, "I don't want you."</i>

927
00:51:05,042 --> 00:51:05,875
Fuck...

928
00:51:06,042 --> 00:51:08,583
You'll never fucking matter.

929
00:51:12,458 --> 00:51:14,167
What?

930
00:51:14,542 --> 00:51:17,292
- You'll never fucking matter.
- Fucking matter.

931
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:25,625
<i>- You'll...
- You'll...</i>

932
00:51:25,792 --> 00:51:27,167
- never...
<i>- never...</i>

933
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:28,917
- fucking...
- <i>fucking...</i>

934
00:51:29,083 --> 00:51:31,875
- matter.
<i>- matter...</i>

935
00:51:33,917 --> 00:51:35,292
She never said that.

936
00:51:35,458 --> 00:51:36,417
No.

937
00:51:36,583 --> 00:51:38,458
But I bet she thought it.

938
00:51:40,583 --> 00:51:42,208
You are so mean!

939
00:51:42,375 --> 00:51:45,000
My brain could taste your fingers,
and they tasted like hate!

940
00:51:45,708 --> 00:51:48,208
And where in God's name
is the intimacy coordinator?

941
00:51:48,375 --> 00:51:50,625
You're so lost, Mr. Wilson.

942
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:53,417
And long before you came here.

943
00:51:54,917 --> 00:51:57,333
This is Baby Knife.
She's gonna fuck you in the face now.

944
00:51:57,583 --> 00:52:00,542
If you want to kill me,
it's going to take more than a little blade.

945
00:52:00,833 --> 00:52:01,708
How about six?

946
00:52:03,708 --> 00:52:05,542
My boy's wicked strong.

947
00:52:06,042 --> 00:52:07,583
That's my big boy.

948
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:09,208
Yes, you are.

949
00:52:15,042 --> 00:52:16,625
Well, this has been fun.

950
00:52:17,042 --> 00:52:19,208
But the big guy needs to eat
and the rent is due.

951
00:52:22,625 --> 00:52:23,458
By the way...

952
00:52:23,625 --> 00:52:25,042
you're the rent.

953
00:52:45,208 --> 00:52:47,042
Come on! Fuck!

954
00:52:47,208 --> 00:52:48,292
You comin' or what?

955
00:52:48,458 --> 00:52:49,333
Coming!

956
00:53:09,542 --> 00:53:10,542
What you thinkin' 'bout?

957
00:53:10,708 --> 00:53:11,750
Get the fuck off of me!

958
00:53:12,292 --> 00:53:13,167
Almost done.

959
00:53:13,333 --> 00:53:14,417
Almost done what?

960
00:53:14,583 --> 00:53:16,958
Getting my knife out of your buttocks,
pervert!

961
00:53:17,125 --> 00:53:18,042
Fuck!

962
00:53:18,208 --> 00:53:19,917
Get your mind out of my pants!

963
00:53:20,083 --> 00:53:20,917
I'm telling Blake.

964
00:53:21,083 --> 00:53:22,125
New rules.

965
00:53:22,667 --> 00:53:23,500
I talk now.

966
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:27,083
- That's gonna be very hard on the audience.
- Shut the fuck up!

967
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:28,708
Let me fuckin' think.

968
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,833
Now we gotta get back to Paradox, right?

969
00:53:32,917 --> 00:53:33,750
Right?

970
00:53:35,625 --> 00:53:38,917
- Am I allowed to speak now or...
- Just nod, asshole.

971
00:53:40,542 --> 00:53:41,458
Right.

972
00:53:41,625 --> 00:53:44,458
Then we find the others that poor kid, Johnny
was talking about before you got him killed!

973
00:53:44,625 --> 00:53:46,250
"Poor kid." He's like fifty!

974
00:53:46,417 --> 00:53:48,917
Yeah, if there's a chance they know
how to get out of here, we find 'em.

975
00:53:49,083 --> 00:53:52,458
And make those TVA fuckers fix my shit
like you fucking promised!

976
00:53:52,625 --> 00:53:53,833
I smell quest.

977
00:53:56,583 --> 00:53:57,583
I smell food.

978
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,333
So what made you finally wear an
honest-to-God costume?

979
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:08,125
Mine's red so they can't see me bleed.

980
00:54:08,292 --> 00:54:10,958
But I could see how
yellow would be useful too.

981
00:54:11,125 --> 00:54:12,667
Have you been checked for ADHD?

982
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:13,875
Mm-mm.

983
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:16,250
But I've had several STDs, which...

984
00:54:16,417 --> 00:54:18,125
were probably caused by ADHD.

985
00:54:18,292 --> 00:54:19,083
Fuck!

986
00:54:20,542 --> 00:54:21,500
What are you looking for?

987
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:23,792
Thank fuck.

988
00:54:24,833 --> 00:54:26,625
No, no, no. That's rubbing alcohol.

989
00:54:26,792 --> 00:54:29,375
You don't want to drink...
Oh, yeah. There you go. Fuck that liver.

990
00:54:31,083 --> 00:54:32,792
Good. Okay.

991
00:54:33,833 --> 00:54:34,958
What the fuck are those?

992
00:54:36,625 --> 00:54:39,417
Back in civilian life, I wear a toupee,
but nobody knows.

993
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,000
Everybody knows.

994
00:54:46,792 --> 00:54:48,500
Wanna talk about what's haunting you, or...

995
00:54:48,667 --> 00:54:50,583
should we wait for a third act flashback?

996
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:52,500
Go fuck yourself.

997
00:54:55,833 --> 00:54:56,667
You know...

998
00:54:58,542 --> 00:54:59,958
in my world, you're...

999
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,250
You're well regarded.

1000
00:55:03,542 --> 00:55:04,833
Yeah, well, not in mine.

1001
00:55:06,042 --> 00:55:09,250
- They don't like me much in mine either.
- You don't say.

1002
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:11,125
I wanted to be something, you know. I...

1003
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:13,875
Shit, I wanted to be an Avenger.

1004
00:55:14,125 --> 00:55:15,958
- Fuck the Avengers.
- Yeah.

1005
00:55:16,458 --> 00:55:18,542
I didn't make the cut, though.
Same with the X-Men...

1006
00:55:20,667 --> 00:55:21,667
When my girlfriend left me...

1007
00:55:21,833 --> 00:55:22,958
- and then I just...
- You had a girlfriend?

1008
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:24,542
Yeah.

1009
00:55:25,042 --> 00:55:25,875
Vanessa.

1010
00:55:26,542 --> 00:55:27,958
When we met, she was a dancer.

1011
00:55:29,167 --> 00:55:30,167
We had a whole life.

1012
00:55:31,458 --> 00:55:32,458
It was good.

1013
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:34,625
But, oh, boy, I just...

1014
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:38,083
Fucked that right up.

1015
00:55:38,958 --> 00:55:40,000
But you.

1016
00:55:40,167 --> 00:55:41,292
You were an X-Man.

1017
00:55:41,625 --> 00:55:43,458
Fuck that. You were the X-Man. You...

1018
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:46,542
The Wolverine.

1019
00:55:48,917 --> 00:55:50,458
He was a hero in my world.

1020
00:55:52,375 --> 00:55:53,208
Yeah, well...

1021
00:55:54,625 --> 00:55:55,792
he ain't shit in mine.

1022
00:56:01,333 --> 00:56:03,833
You said, "Logan was a hero."
What happened?

1023
00:56:04,708 --> 00:56:05,542
He died.

1024
00:56:06,292 --> 00:56:07,125
How?

1025
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,500
Well, technically,
you were chest-fucked by a tree, but...

1026
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:13,250
really, you just ran out of batteries
trying to save someone.

1027
00:56:13,417 --> 00:56:14,250
Who?

1028
00:56:14,625 --> 00:56:17,917
The shitheels that grew her in a lab
called her "X-23." But...

1029
00:56:18,667 --> 00:56:19,792
she was just a kid.

1030
00:56:20,583 --> 00:56:24,000
A younger, daintier,
somehow meaner version of you.

1031
00:56:24,167 --> 00:56:25,542
You died trying to save her.

1032
00:56:25,917 --> 00:56:26,750
It was beautiful.

1033
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,792
Look, <i>mijo,</i> I know you're hurtin'.

1034
00:56:30,542 --> 00:56:34,167
My blind, elderly, African-American roommate,
Blind Al, always says that...

1035
00:56:34,333 --> 00:56:36,000
pain teaches us who we are.

1036
00:56:36,167 --> 00:56:38,708
Sometimes we need to listen to that pain
instead of running from it.

1037
00:56:38,875 --> 00:56:40,542
- Holy shit.
- Yeah, she's wise.

1038
00:56:40,708 --> 00:56:43,083
No, no, no. That's her name?
You call her "Blind Al?"

1039
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:44,250
Well, she's blind.

1040
00:57:21,875 --> 00:57:23,125
Look at you!

1041
00:57:23,292 --> 00:57:24,292
She's coming with us.

1042
00:57:24,458 --> 00:57:26,333
- No, she's not. Fuck no!
- Oh, yes, she is.

1043
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,417
- Oh, yes...
- Sorry!

1044
00:57:28,792 --> 00:57:30,167
Sorry about that!

1045
00:57:30,583 --> 00:57:31,708
Come here, girl!

1046
00:57:32,667 --> 00:57:33,875
Who are you?

1047
00:57:34,042 --> 00:57:35,333
Oh, I'm Deadpool.

1048
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:36,792
And I guess you're Deadpool too.

1049
00:57:36,958 --> 00:57:38,958
But in here, everybody calls me "Nicepool."

1050
00:57:39,375 --> 00:57:42,333
Oh, my goodness. Wait till you see Ladypool.
She is gorgeous.

1051
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:43,875
She just had a baby too. And...

1052
00:57:44,625 --> 00:57:45,458
Can't even tell.

1053
00:57:45,625 --> 00:57:46,958
I don't think you're supposed to say that.

1054
00:57:47,125 --> 00:57:47,958
That's okay.

1055
00:57:48,625 --> 00:57:50,125
I identify as a feminist.

1056
00:57:50,292 --> 00:57:51,167
Right.

1057
00:57:52,958 --> 00:57:55,958
Are those gold-plated,
...50 caliber Desert Eagle pistoleros?

1058
00:57:56,125 --> 00:57:57,250
'Course.

1059
00:57:57,625 --> 00:57:58,792
To match my ear huggie.

1060
00:57:58,958 --> 00:57:59,833
Can I have 'em?

1061
00:58:00,792 --> 00:58:02,125
Over my dead body.

1062
00:58:02,458 --> 00:58:03,333
You're fun.

1063
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:07,833
And I guess you've already met Mary Puppins.
AKA Dogpool.

1064
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,042
Careful where you put your hands.

1065
00:58:09,208 --> 00:58:12,042
She's ninety percent g-spot,
and she'll let you know it.

1066
00:58:12,208 --> 00:58:15,625
You let this little flirt out of your sight
for one second and...

1067
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:17,833
she starts shopping for a new papa.

1068
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,458
If you can't be a responsible pet owner, then
maybe you don't deserve this little unicorn.

1069
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:24,417
Guilty on all charges, Your Honor.

1070
00:58:24,958 --> 00:58:25,958
Shan't happen again.

1071
00:58:26,125 --> 00:58:27,458
Why are you so nice?

1072
00:58:27,625 --> 00:58:29,000
Oh, it costs nothing to be kind.

1073
00:58:29,167 --> 00:58:30,917
Shutting the fuck up is also free.

1074
00:58:31,583 --> 00:58:32,458
This is Logan.

1075
00:58:32,625 --> 00:58:35,375
He's usually shirtless,
but he's let himself go since the divorce.

1076
00:58:36,708 --> 00:58:38,250
Where's your mask?

1077
00:58:40,958 --> 00:58:41,792
Come on, guys.

1078
00:58:43,458 --> 00:58:44,542
Ugh, this guy.

1079
00:58:44,708 --> 00:58:46,208
We're looking for a group of survivors.

1080
00:58:46,375 --> 00:58:47,208
Oh, they're out there.

1081
00:58:47,375 --> 00:58:50,750
Yeah, but merc to merc, you better hope
that you don't run into the Deadpool corps.

1082
00:58:50,917 --> 00:58:51,875
Yeah, they're crazy.

1083
00:58:52,042 --> 00:58:55,000
They will chop you up into a thousand pieces
and hide you all over The Void.

1084
00:58:55,167 --> 00:58:57,000
If they could only process
their childhood trauma...

1085
00:58:57,167 --> 00:58:58,750
they'd go on one heck of a healing journey.

1086
00:58:58,917 --> 00:58:59,917
Look, we're headed for the borderlands.

1087
00:59:00,083 --> 00:59:01,042
You know where it is?

1088
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:05,542
Yeah, that... That's twelve klicks due west.
I can lend you my ride, if you like.

1089
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,417
It would be my honor.

1090
00:59:11,083 --> 00:59:13,125
No, no, no. Absolutely not.

1091
00:59:13,292 --> 00:59:15,167
Uh-uh. What the...
No! No!

1092
00:59:15,333 --> 00:59:16,250
Just get in the car.

1093
00:59:16,417 --> 00:59:17,500
This isn't a car.

1094
00:59:17,667 --> 00:59:19,875
This is a Honda fuckin' Odyssey.

1095
00:59:20,042 --> 00:59:21,917
Throttle response sucks a cock.

1096
00:59:22,083 --> 00:59:23,208
Dated infotainment system.

1097
00:59:23,375 --> 00:59:26,000
When Honda saw that untreated chlamydia
was makin' a comeback...

1098
00:59:26,167 --> 00:59:28,958
they invented the Honda Odyssey to compete.

1099
00:59:29,125 --> 00:59:31,833
Get in the fucking car.

1100
00:59:32,167 --> 00:59:33,958
She'll get you there safe and sound.

1101
00:59:34,125 --> 00:59:35,583
Old Betsy always does.

1102
00:59:36,458 --> 00:59:38,375
You're gonna have to
give me my dog back, though.

1103
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:41,250
I know. Listen. Yes, child.

1104
00:59:41,417 --> 00:59:43,875
If you ever wanna give her up,
or if she needs a new home...

1105
00:59:44,042 --> 00:59:45,917
or if something
should happen to you...

1106
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:47,292
I'd love to be her papa.

1107
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,625
What would ever happen to me?

1108
00:59:49,792 --> 00:59:50,833
Lots of stuff.

1109
00:59:54,542 --> 00:59:56,792
- Jesus.
- No! We're running away.

1110
00:59:57,833 --> 00:59:59,542
- Give me that.
- The corn was too dense, girl!

1111
00:59:59,708 --> 01:00:00,542
- There.
- Come here!

1112
01:00:00,708 --> 01:00:01,958
- Fuck!
- Hello!

1113
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:05,250
Bye.

1114
01:00:31,042 --> 01:00:32,042
Okay, I'm just gonna ask...

1115
01:00:32,417 --> 01:00:33,583
What's with the suit?

1116
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:35,208
First thing I did when I flamed out...

1117
01:00:35,375 --> 01:00:36,375
- I took mine off.
- Drop it.

1118
01:00:36,542 --> 01:00:37,500
It's not that ugly.

1119
01:00:37,667 --> 01:00:39,250
- Stop talking about my suit.
- Did you make it yourself?

1120
01:00:39,417 --> 01:00:40,833
- Been there.
- Quit. Now.

1121
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,083
The X-Men make you wear it?
Those sons of fuckin' bitches.

1122
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:45,750
They are not your friends,
I'll tell you that.

1123
01:00:45,917 --> 01:00:46,917
Friends don't let friends...

1124
01:00:47,083 --> 01:00:49,958
leave the house lookin' like they
fight crime for the Los Angeles Rams.

1125
01:00:50,125 --> 01:00:51,208
Shut the fuck up about this, or...

1126
01:00:51,375 --> 01:00:53,583
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Watch your frown lines, angel baby.

1127
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,917
- I'm just trying to bond a little bit.
- Yeah, well, then talk about somethin' else.

1128
01:00:56,083 --> 01:00:57,000
Fine.

1129
01:01:04,167 --> 01:01:05,208
Stop it.

1130
01:01:06,917 --> 01:01:07,750
If they can fix your world...

1131
01:01:07,917 --> 01:01:09,542
what's the first thing you're gonna do
when you get out of here?

1132
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:12,833
Get some rubbing alcohol shots,
maybe a wiper fluid chaser?

1133
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:13,917
What did you say?

1134
01:01:14,083 --> 01:01:15,708
I said when you get back,
what's the first thing you're gonna do?

1135
01:01:15,875 --> 01:01:17,208
No, no, no. Before that.

1136
01:01:18,458 --> 01:01:20,125
If... they can fix your world?

1137
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:25,708
What do you mean, "if?"

1138
01:01:26,542 --> 01:01:27,375
- I mean...
- You lied to me.

1139
01:01:27,542 --> 01:01:30,083
You don't have a fucking clue
if they can help me fix things, do you?

1140
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:31,333
No. I, I mean...

1141
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,792
Fuck! Fuck! I didn't lie!

1142
01:01:34,958 --> 01:01:37,625
- You lied!
- No! I made an educated wish!

1143
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:40,458
Because I need you.

1144
01:01:41,792 --> 01:01:44,792
This. This is why. Right here.

1145
01:01:45,833 --> 01:01:47,333
'Cause if we don't do something, they die.

1146
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:49,667
I don't know anything about saving worlds.

1147
01:01:49,833 --> 01:01:51,375
And why would I even care?

1148
01:01:51,542 --> 01:01:54,458
Because my entire world
is right here in this picture.

1149
01:01:54,917 --> 01:01:56,917
It's only nine people...

1150
01:01:57,083 --> 01:01:59,125
and I have no idea how to save it alone.

1151
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:02,333
I know how to fuck people up for money.
But you...

1152
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:04,083
you know how to save 'em!

1153
01:02:05,333 --> 01:02:06,542
At least the other Wolverine did.

1154
01:02:07,792 --> 01:02:10,208
Fuck! I guess I'm stuck with the worst one.

1155
01:02:10,375 --> 01:02:12,625
Did you say you made...

1156
01:02:12,792 --> 01:02:16,083
an educated fucking wish?

1157
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:18,375
They call me "The Merc with the Mouth."

1158
01:02:18,542 --> 01:02:22,417
They don't call me "Truthful Timmy,
the Blowjob Queen of Saskatoon."

1159
01:02:26,292 --> 01:02:27,208
One more word.

1160
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:29,958
Please give me one.

1161
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:34,750
Gubernatorial.

1162
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:36,500
Oh, fuck!

1163
01:02:38,125 --> 01:02:39,542
You know what? You're a fucking joke.

1164
01:02:41,333 --> 01:02:42,750
No wonder the Avengers didn't take you.

1165
01:02:42,917 --> 01:02:45,042
Or the X-Men.
And they'll take fucking anyone.

1166
01:02:45,542 --> 01:02:46,917
I mean, you are...

1167
01:02:47,083 --> 01:02:50,625
a ridiculous, immature, half-wit moron.

1168
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:52,958
I have never met...

1169
01:02:53,125 --> 01:02:54,333
a sadder...

1170
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,875
more attention-starved,
jabbering little prick...

1171
01:02:57,042 --> 01:03:00,458
in my entire life. And that says a lot,
'cause I've been alive...

1172
01:03:00,625 --> 01:03:04,458
for more than two hundred fuckin' years,
and I'll tell you...

1173
01:03:04,625 --> 01:03:08,833
that bald chick was right about one thing.
You will never save the world!

1174
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,500
You couldn't even save a relationship...

1175
01:03:11,667 --> 01:03:13,542
with a goddamn stripper!

1176
01:03:13,708 --> 01:03:16,167
And motherfucker,
I wish I could say you'd die alone...

1177
01:03:16,333 --> 01:03:19,250
but it's one of God's best jokes
that you can't die...

1178
01:03:19,417 --> 01:03:20,917
except that's on all of us!

1179
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,458
Oh, you got nothing to say, Mouth?

1180
01:03:36,125 --> 01:03:37,792
I'm gonna fight you now.

1181
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,250
Oh, are you?

1182
01:03:51,958 --> 01:03:53,958
Mm. Not talkin' now, are ya?

1183
01:04:00,625 --> 01:04:01,667
You dirty bitch.

1184
01:04:17,375 --> 01:04:18,208
Whoo!

1185
01:04:34,792 --> 01:04:36,000
No, no, no!

1186
01:04:54,833 --> 01:04:55,667
Baby Knife!

1187
01:04:59,417 --> 01:05:02,500
I take it all back.
The Honda Odyssey fucks hard.

1188
01:05:02,917 --> 01:05:04,375
Too bad you don't, needle dick.

1189
01:05:04,542 --> 01:05:05,750
Oh, we're just gettin' started, bub.

1190
01:05:10,333 --> 01:05:11,583
Oh, you... Fuck!

1191
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:05,333
Thor!

1192
01:06:08,417 --> 01:06:09,333
Where are we?

1193
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:12,125
No clue, but... I like it here.

1194
01:06:20,292 --> 01:06:22,125
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1195
01:07:11,167 --> 01:07:12,083
Okay.

1196
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,833
Look at you... all. You must be the others.

1197
01:07:16,542 --> 01:07:17,375
Terrific.

1198
01:07:17,708 --> 01:07:21,042
So just to refresh, you are...

1199
01:07:21,208 --> 01:07:23,583
- Wonder... Elektra? Yes. Who could forget?
- Elektra.

1200
01:07:24,417 --> 01:07:29,125
And you. I was not expecting to see you here.
I thought you were, you know...

1201
01:07:29,292 --> 01:07:30,250
retired.

1202
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:32,333
Retarded?

1203
01:07:33,833 --> 01:07:34,792
"Retired."

1204
01:07:34,958 --> 01:07:37,167
I'm already in The Void.
I'm not trying to get canceled again.

1205
01:07:37,333 --> 01:07:38,083
I don't like you.

1206
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:39,083
You never did.

1207
01:07:40,792 --> 01:07:44,500
And who's this succulent reminder
of my own inadequacies?

1208
01:07:44,667 --> 01:07:45,750
Look at you.

1209
01:07:46,417 --> 01:07:48,500
You look like the
superhero version of Hawkeye.

1210
01:07:49,125 --> 01:07:51,917
The name's Remy LeBeau, <i>Le Diable Blanc.</i>

1211
01:07:52,625 --> 01:07:53,583
But you can call me the Gambit.

1212
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:56,500
It's been a while since I've seen
<i>Sling Blade</i>. Hit me again.

1213
01:07:57,583 --> 01:07:58,542
They call me the Gambit.

1214
01:07:58,708 --> 01:08:01,167
Do they? Are you sure you didn't just
really, really want them to...

1215
01:08:01,333 --> 01:08:02,458
but it never quite worked out?

1216
01:08:05,333 --> 01:08:07,625
You know,
we never had a Wolverine up in here.

1217
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:11,375
But I can tell you now,
it's just a common courtesy to ask...

1218
01:08:11,542 --> 01:08:13,208
before you drink up all of my liquor.

1219
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,542
Well, it's a good thing I don't give a fuck.

1220
01:08:18,750 --> 01:08:19,582
Fuck.

1221
01:08:22,707 --> 01:08:23,832
So embarrassing.

1222
01:08:26,042 --> 01:08:28,707
Well, now that that's settled, look,
we came a long way to find you three.

1223
01:08:28,875 --> 01:08:29,667
There's four of us.

1224
01:08:29,832 --> 01:08:31,707
There's four... Hey, wait. Is it Magneto?

1225
01:08:32,542 --> 01:08:34,875
Dear sweet God in heaven,
let it be Magneto...

1226
01:08:35,042 --> 01:08:35,917
- because with him...
- He's dead.

1227
01:08:36,082 --> 01:08:37,957
Fuck!
Now Disney gets cheap?

1228
01:08:38,125 --> 01:08:41,250
It's like Pinocchio jammed his face in my ass
and started lying like crazy.

1229
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:42,500
Ooh, you nasty!

1230
01:08:44,667 --> 01:08:47,375
Not a single word. What do you do exactly?

1231
01:08:47,542 --> 01:08:50,125
Charge the playing cards
and make 'em go boom!

1232
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:52,250
Your power's close up magic. That's good.

1233
01:08:52,417 --> 01:08:53,832
We're not totally fucked at all.

1234
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,500
So who brought us here?

1235
01:08:55,667 --> 01:08:56,582
That would be me.

1236
01:09:06,917 --> 01:09:07,750
Don't make me regret it.

1237
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,917
Holy shit. Logan. That's her.
That's X-23.

1238
01:09:13,417 --> 01:09:14,917
She's the one I told you about.

1239
01:09:19,457 --> 01:09:21,542
Hey, how did you all get stuck in The Void?

1240
01:09:21,707 --> 01:09:23,082
There was a knock at the door.

1241
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:25,167
- TVA sent me here.
- Me, too.

1242
01:09:25,332 --> 01:09:27,500
Well, maybe I was born here.
It's, it's hard to know for sure.

1243
01:09:27,832 --> 01:09:30,042
TVA decided our universe was dying.

1244
01:09:31,332 --> 01:09:33,207
And I never even got a chance
to fight for it.

1245
01:09:36,042 --> 01:09:38,125
People like us don't go quietly.

1246
01:09:38,292 --> 01:09:40,125
TVA knows that, so they took us out.

1247
01:09:40,832 --> 01:09:42,832
The answer is yes. I'm in.

1248
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,417
- In what?
- A team.

1249
01:09:45,082 --> 01:09:46,957
Me, you, you, and me. All of us together.

1250
01:09:47,125 --> 01:09:48,207
Let's get the fuck out of this place.

1251
01:09:48,375 --> 01:09:51,792
- Don't listen to him. He's a fucking liar!
- It was an educated wish!

1252
01:09:52,832 --> 01:09:53,667
Look.

1253
01:09:55,208 --> 01:09:56,875
We've been inside Cassandra's lair.

1254
01:09:57,208 --> 01:09:59,750
The only way out of The Void
is through her.

1255
01:09:59,917 --> 01:10:01,667
She can get us home. She told us.

1256
01:10:01,833 --> 01:10:03,375
Wait a minute, you've been inside?

1257
01:10:04,167 --> 01:10:05,958
- And you made it out alive?
- Bullshit.

1258
01:10:06,125 --> 01:10:07,708
- Nobody's ever done that.
- We did.

1259
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:10,125
Every time one of us
has gone up against her...

1260
01:10:10,542 --> 01:10:11,375
they die.

1261
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:14,542
The Punisher, The Quicksilver, The Daredevil.

1262
01:10:14,708 --> 01:10:16,042
Daredevil? I'm so sorry.

1263
01:10:16,208 --> 01:10:17,375
- It's fine.
- Okay.

1264
01:10:19,667 --> 01:10:22,125
Even that sweet, baby angel, Johnny Storm.

1265
01:10:22,875 --> 01:10:24,417
He up and gone missing like...

1266
01:10:24,708 --> 01:10:25,708
what, two days ago?

1267
01:10:26,417 --> 01:10:28,125
Ugh. That's so sad.

1268
01:10:28,833 --> 01:10:31,583
Wherever this Johnny fella is,
I'm sure he's thriving.

1269
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:35,833
Look, there's, there's strength in numbers.
All right? Us...

1270
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,375
plus, you guys. We can put Cassandra...

1271
01:10:37,542 --> 01:10:39,667
over our knee and force her
to let us out of The Void.

1272
01:10:39,833 --> 01:10:41,417
I know what it means to feel self-doubt.

1273
01:10:41,583 --> 01:10:43,000
- I don't feel that at all.
- I'm good.

1274
01:10:43,167 --> 01:10:45,083
Gnawing at your gut like a coked-up tapeworm.

1275
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:46,917
It's like you're
holding up a mirror to my soul.

1276
01:10:47,083 --> 01:10:49,708
You guys may not have been able to
save your universes.

1277
01:10:49,875 --> 01:10:51,333
But you can avenge them.

1278
01:10:52,125 --> 01:10:53,500
It's what Johnny would have wanted.

1279
01:10:53,667 --> 01:10:56,333
Wait. You knew Johnny?

1280
01:10:57,333 --> 01:10:58,500
Oh, yeah.

1281
01:10:58,667 --> 01:11:00,500
Dickhead here talked him into a team up...

1282
01:11:00,667 --> 01:11:03,042
and Johnny came down
with a little case of the deads.

1283
01:11:03,208 --> 01:11:04,458
No, no, no. We don't know that.

1284
01:11:04,625 --> 01:11:06,750
It was just a flesh wound.
He may have survived.

1285
01:11:06,917 --> 01:11:09,500
If he survived that, he is prayin' for death.

1286
01:11:09,667 --> 01:11:11,958
- Thank you, Doctor Wolverine!
- Spill it!

1287
01:11:12,125 --> 01:11:13,333
What'd you do to Johnny, huh?

1288
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:14,708
Talk or I'm gonna start dealin'.

1289
01:11:14,875 --> 01:11:16,083
Okay. Okay. Hey, hey, hey.

1290
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:17,583
Look.

1291
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:20,042
He ran his fat-ass mouth about Cassandra.

1292
01:11:20,208 --> 01:11:21,917
Then she zip-zapped his skin...

1293
01:11:22,083 --> 01:11:24,125
leaving his organs to
splash crudely onto the ground...

1294
01:11:24,292 --> 01:11:26,833
while the soil greedily drank his blood.
It was horrible.

1295
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,333
He was like a brother to me.

1296
01:11:28,958 --> 01:11:31,958
Look, he died
before he could make a difference. But...

1297
01:11:32,125 --> 01:11:34,458
Look, maybe you couldn't save your worlds,
but...

1298
01:11:34,625 --> 01:11:37,167
but Jesus Christ, you can save mine!

1299
01:11:37,333 --> 01:11:39,792
I don't give a shit about your world, but...

1300
01:11:39,958 --> 01:11:42,875
if these two made it out of there alive,
maybe together...

1301
01:11:43,042 --> 01:11:44,667
we can get back in.
And take her down.

1302
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:47,375
Where I come from,
we call that suicide, <i>Chère.</i>

1303
01:11:47,833 --> 01:11:51,542
If we can block her psychic powers,
we can get a leg up. I know it.

1304
01:11:51,708 --> 01:11:53,250
Now I know Magneto's dead.

1305
01:11:53,792 --> 01:11:55,708
But I'd venture to guess that his helmet...

1306
01:11:55,875 --> 01:11:58,250
- is lying around here somewhere...
- Cassandra melted the helmet.

1307
01:11:58,417 --> 01:11:59,542
- Fuck!
- After she killed him.

1308
01:11:59,708 --> 01:12:00,625
Fuck!

1309
01:12:00,792 --> 01:12:01,583
She don't play.

1310
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:04,667
She knows that helmet was the only way
to protect anyone from her powers.

1311
01:12:04,833 --> 01:12:07,167
The only other helmet that strong is
Juggernaut's, but...

1312
01:12:07,333 --> 01:12:09,417
- he works for Cassandra.
- Juggernaut's helmet. That's it.

1313
01:12:09,583 --> 01:12:11,125
Yeah, and we done be knowing
that lid ain't comin' off...

1314
01:12:11,292 --> 01:12:13,583
- without that dome gonna come off wit'it.
- I'm so sorry, beautiful.

1315
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:17,083
I want this to be gentle.
Who is your dialect coach? The Minions?

1316
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:20,083
I feel like
we are missing critical exposition here.

1317
01:12:21,583 --> 01:12:24,292
I'm sick of this shit.
I'm sick of hiding.

1318
01:12:25,583 --> 01:12:27,500
Let's face it, our worlds forgot about us.

1319
01:12:27,667 --> 01:12:29,292
Or never learned about us.

1320
01:12:29,458 --> 01:12:30,750
The heroes we were.

1321
01:12:30,917 --> 01:12:32,042
Lives we saved.

1322
01:12:32,208 --> 01:12:33,667
Or wanted to save.

1323
01:12:33,833 --> 01:12:35,500
Maybe these two are our chance.

1324
01:12:37,125 --> 01:12:38,208
To be remembered.

1325
01:12:38,667 --> 01:12:39,750
The way we deserve.

1326
01:12:40,917 --> 01:12:41,875
Yes.

1327
01:12:42,042 --> 01:12:42,958
An ending.

1328
01:12:43,833 --> 01:12:44,958
- Legacy.
- Yes!

1329
01:12:45,125 --> 01:12:46,708
Yes! Let this man cook.

1330
01:12:46,875 --> 01:12:48,125
This is what I'm talking about.

1331
01:12:48,292 --> 01:12:50,125
Big slow-motion fights, sad music.

1332
01:12:50,292 --> 01:12:53,250
Everybody working together. Who knows if you
live or die? That sorta thing.

1333
01:12:53,417 --> 01:12:55,417
- Who's ready?
- I was born ready.

1334
01:12:55,583 --> 01:12:56,583
Yes!
Gambit?

1335
01:12:56,750 --> 01:12:59,667
I ain't know my daddy,
but I'm sure I shot out of his dick ready.

1336
01:12:59,833 --> 01:13:01,583
Jesus Christ, that is graphic.

1337
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:03,625
Yeah. He was layin' them buttery nuts
all up in my mama...

1338
01:13:03,792 --> 01:13:05,583
and I shot out there and I said,
"What's up, Doc?"

1339
01:13:06,417 --> 01:13:09,625
Johnny must have loved you.
X-23, what's it gonna be?

1340
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:11,500
The name's Laura.

1341
01:13:11,667 --> 01:13:14,542
- Let's fucking go.
- Let's fucking go!

1342
01:13:14,708 --> 01:13:16,333
- It's on like chicken and corn.
- Yeah!

1343
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:18,417
- We're doing this.
- You're all fuckin' dead.

1344
01:13:18,583 --> 01:13:20,625
My God! Read the room.

1345
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:34,667
Hey, hey. I'm not lookin' for company.
Get out of here.

1346
01:13:36,875 --> 01:13:37,917
You remind me of him.

1347
01:13:38,542 --> 01:13:40,000
Angry. Drunk. Mean...

1348
01:13:40,375 --> 01:13:42,333
- Sounds like a great guy...
- Wasn't finished.

1349
01:13:44,333 --> 01:13:45,833
Showed up when it mattered the most.

1350
01:13:48,125 --> 01:13:49,708
Couldn't help it.

1351
01:13:53,125 --> 01:13:54,083
You might not know it, but...

1352
01:13:55,542 --> 01:13:56,667
you're a good man, Logan.

1353
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,708
You might not know it, but apparently,
I'm the worst Logan.

1354
01:14:03,917 --> 01:14:05,542
I got to have a life because of you.

1355
01:14:08,667 --> 01:14:10,083
I got to grow up because of you.

1356
01:14:12,333 --> 01:14:13,417
A lot of kids did.

1357
01:14:14,083 --> 01:14:16,000
A lot of kids didn't grow up because of me.

1358
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:19,750
Trust me, kid, I'm no hero.

1359
01:14:21,167 --> 01:14:22,625
That suit says different.

1360
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:24,542
Yeah. Do you like it?

1361
01:14:27,292 --> 01:14:28,917
Scott used to beg me to wear it.

1362
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:33,750
So did Jean, Storm, Beast.

1363
01:14:35,875 --> 01:14:36,875
All of them.

1364
01:14:38,167 --> 01:14:41,375
They wanted me to be part of the team,
but I wouldn't.

1365
01:14:41,875 --> 01:14:45,000
Told 'em they all look fucking ridiculous.
I mean...

1366
01:14:47,042 --> 01:14:49,500
I couldn't have 'em thinkin'
I wanted to be there.

1367
01:14:55,333 --> 01:14:58,333
And then one day, while I was off on my own,
the humans came...

1368
01:14:59,208 --> 01:15:00,500
and went mutant hunting.

1369
01:15:01,833 --> 01:15:02,917
I can guess the rest.

1370
01:15:03,083 --> 01:15:03,917
No, no, let me...

1371
01:15:05,625 --> 01:15:06,583
Let me say it. I...

1372
01:15:09,375 --> 01:15:10,333
I need to say it.

1373
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:16,333
By the time I stumbled home
shitfaced from the bar, it was too late.

1374
01:15:20,958 --> 01:15:21,958
They were dead. Every...

1375
01:15:28,667 --> 01:15:31,625
This suit's all I got to remind me of
who they were.

1376
01:15:33,625 --> 01:15:34,500
And what I did.

1377
01:15:47,792 --> 01:15:49,250
We're headed to Cassandra's at sunup.

1378
01:15:50,292 --> 01:15:52,083
Have fun. Not my fight.

1379
01:15:55,583 --> 01:15:56,958
We won't pull this off without you.

1380
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:07,375
Hey. Whoever you think I am,
you got the wrong guy.

1381
01:16:10,333 --> 01:16:11,458
You were always the wrong guy.

1382
01:16:37,667 --> 01:16:38,500
What?

1383
01:16:38,667 --> 01:16:40,125
Alioth didn't get them.

1384
01:16:41,083 --> 01:16:43,292
Cassandra wanted to
play with them herself first.

1385
01:16:43,458 --> 01:16:44,292
<i>They got away.</i>

1386
01:16:44,458 --> 01:16:46,083
- Did they find the others?
- No.

1387
01:16:46,250 --> 01:16:47,458
Good. All right. Phew.

1388
01:16:47,625 --> 01:16:48,667
<i>The others found them.</i>

1389
01:16:48,833 --> 01:16:51,458
Oh, very cute. Well done, Pyro.
Classic bait and switch.

1390
01:16:51,625 --> 01:16:53,083
<i>- You really got me there.
-</i> Relax.

1391
01:16:54,042 --> 01:16:56,333
If they come after Nova, she'll handle it.

1392
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:58,542
Cassandra is a lunatic wild card.

1393
01:16:58,708 --> 01:17:00,333
Why do you think we put her there
in the first place?

1394
01:17:00,917 --> 01:17:02,875
Thank God she's never chosen
to leave The Void.

1395
01:17:03,042 --> 01:17:05,583
The Time Ripper is hours away
from completion.

1396
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:06,875
I cannot take any chances.

1397
01:17:07,042 --> 01:17:08,083
Well, maybe not.

1398
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:09,333
<i>But I can.</i>

1399
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:10,458
For a price.

1400
01:17:10,625 --> 01:17:12,083
<i>Why do you have to
say it in that silly voice?</i>

1401
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:13,333
It's so icky.

1402
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:14,333
<i>You want it done or not?</i>

1403
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:15,333
All right. Your price.

1404
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:16,750
<i>Take her out.</i>

1405
01:17:17,417 --> 01:17:18,958
Ugh. Mutants.

1406
01:17:41,167 --> 01:17:42,250
Ooh! Look at that there!

1407
01:17:42,417 --> 01:17:45,125
You see them biggum hands come closed.
Ain't not a wonna gettin' up inside there.

1408
01:17:45,292 --> 01:17:46,542
I think what Gambit's
trying to say is...

1409
01:17:46,708 --> 01:17:49,417
getting Juggernaut's helmet
ain't gonna be easy.

1410
01:17:49,583 --> 01:17:51,208
I'm just making stuff up at this...

1411
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:53,083
- Yeah. Tilt up to Blade.
- Gun!

1412
01:17:57,833 --> 01:17:59,042
Where'd he get that little beauty?

1413
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:01,583
That's Punisher's AT4.

1414
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:03,750
Which Punisher?
There's been like five of them.

1415
01:18:03,917 --> 01:18:05,208
There's only been one Blade...

1416
01:18:05,792 --> 01:18:07,708
and there's only ever gonna be one Blade.

1417
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:12,917
Incoming!

1418
01:19:19,625 --> 01:19:21,792
Ooh, this is gonna be good.

1419
01:19:21,958 --> 01:19:24,208
You know how long I've been waiting for this?

1420
01:19:24,375 --> 01:19:26,542
Whoo!
I'm about to make a name for myself here.

1421
01:19:26,708 --> 01:19:28,542
I don't think you guys walk away from this.

1422
01:19:28,708 --> 01:19:30,708
You just make sure
people know what happened here today.

1423
01:19:30,875 --> 01:19:32,833
And when you get out of here,
you have a drink for me, yeah?

1424
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,333
You just stay on our six and get inside.

1425
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:37,417
We'll make sure you get the package.

1426
01:19:37,917 --> 01:19:39,208
And we'll get our ending.

1427
01:20:49,333 --> 01:20:50,375
And boom!

1428
01:21:22,083 --> 01:21:24,208
Some motherfuckers still trying
to ice skate uphill.

1429
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:33,167
You two escaping, I could live with.

1430
01:21:33,542 --> 01:21:36,208
But coming back? Willingly?

1431
01:21:37,833 --> 01:21:39,583
Boys are so silly.

1432
01:21:39,750 --> 01:21:40,875
I just need to get home.

1433
01:21:41,042 --> 01:21:43,333
Well, that's not on the menu, I'm afraid.

1434
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:46,750
It's death or enslavement.
À la carte, of course.

1435
01:21:46,917 --> 01:21:47,917
Upsy-daisy.

1436
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:54,625
Finally...

1437
01:21:54,792 --> 01:21:56,667
it's nice to give someone else
a chance to talk.

1438
01:21:56,833 --> 01:21:58,250
Not my strong suit.

1439
01:22:16,542 --> 01:22:17,750
You shouldn't have done that.

1440
01:22:41,333 --> 01:22:43,750
You are an interesting one, aren't you?

1441
01:22:44,333 --> 01:22:48,292
I do feel like
you get lost behind all of his...

1442
01:22:50,625 --> 01:22:53,125
Deadpools are
a dime a dozen here in The Void.

1443
01:22:54,083 --> 01:22:55,458
But you...

1444
01:22:55,958 --> 01:22:58,958
What's going on in here?

1445
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:13,625
Interesting...

1446
01:23:14,792 --> 01:23:16,708
Not what I expected back here.

1447
01:23:17,792 --> 01:23:19,000
Behind the anger.

1448
01:23:23,125 --> 01:23:24,042
You're hiding.

1449
01:23:24,375 --> 01:23:25,208
From them.

1450
01:23:26,417 --> 01:23:28,083
From all the ones you let down.

1451
01:23:30,750 --> 01:23:31,958
So much pain.

1452
01:23:34,542 --> 01:23:35,417
I walked away.

1453
01:23:36,833 --> 01:23:38,375
They called after me and I...

1454
01:23:38,542 --> 01:23:40,333
I walked away.

1455
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:42,125
I always do.

1456
01:23:42,292 --> 01:23:44,000
<i>- Logan!</i>
- I know.

1457
01:23:45,417 --> 01:23:46,708
That's not all you did.

1458
01:23:46,875 --> 01:23:48,292
Is it?

1459
01:23:51,833 --> 01:23:53,208
You found them.

1460
01:23:54,208 --> 01:23:55,208
The X-Men.

1461
01:24:00,625 --> 01:24:01,625
Dead.

1462
01:24:04,375 --> 01:24:05,583
Piled like wood.

1463
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:08,458
<i>What did you do?</i>

1464
01:24:11,167 --> 01:24:12,375
I started killing.

1465
01:24:13,167 --> 01:24:15,667
And I couldn't stop. I didn't wanna stop.

1466
01:24:16,958 --> 01:24:19,792
<i>All those bad men.</i>

1467
01:24:23,542 --> 01:24:25,125
It's not just the bad ones.

1468
01:24:26,792 --> 01:24:27,958
My little animal.

1469
01:24:30,833 --> 01:24:33,625
And I turned the whole world
against the X-Men.

1470
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Blade!

1471
01:24:40,583 --> 01:24:41,792
Just once...

1472
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:46,292
I wanna be the man
that Charles thought I was.

1473
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:48,625
Logan...

1474
01:24:50,208 --> 01:24:53,875
in The Void you can be what you are.

1475
01:24:56,292 --> 01:24:57,750
I just wanna be free.

1476
01:24:58,542 --> 01:25:00,000
I can set you free.

1477
01:25:11,625 --> 01:25:16,750
I can silence all those voices.

1478
01:25:23,583 --> 01:25:24,583
I've got you.

1479
01:25:27,208 --> 01:25:28,208
I've got you.

1480
01:25:28,958 --> 01:25:29,792
No.

1481
01:25:31,250 --> 01:25:32,292
I got you.

1482
01:25:40,958 --> 01:25:42,583
Get it off!

1483
01:25:42,750 --> 01:25:45,875
You're gonna send us home,
or I'm gonna twist your fucking head off.

1484
01:25:46,042 --> 01:25:47,125
Why are you laughing?

1485
01:25:47,792 --> 01:25:51,583
I can't send you home
unless you get this thing off my head.

1486
01:25:52,167 --> 01:25:53,292
And as soon as you do that...

1487
01:25:53,458 --> 01:25:56,333
I'm going to boil your brains
on an atomic level whilst...

1488
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:59,083
flicking my bean to the Enya box set.

1489
01:25:59,250 --> 01:26:00,292
There's an Enya box set?

1490
01:26:00,458 --> 01:26:01,708
Either you kill me...

1491
01:26:01,875 --> 01:26:03,000
or I kill you.

1492
01:26:04,083 --> 01:26:05,625
Both wonderful options.

1493
01:26:06,167 --> 01:26:07,000
You want me to do it?

1494
01:26:07,458 --> 01:26:08,333
No, I'll do it.

1495
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:10,542
I have her neck right here.
It's really no problem.

1496
01:26:10,708 --> 01:26:11,417
You'll screw it up.

1497
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:14,125
Oh, come on, Mr. PG-13,
except the last one!

1498
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,083
What the fuck?

1499
01:26:18,417 --> 01:26:20,667
You have no idea what it's like!

1500
01:26:20,833 --> 01:26:23,750
Day after day. Shovel the shit.

1501
01:26:23,917 --> 01:26:25,250
Fetch the meats.

1502
01:26:25,417 --> 01:26:27,375
I have spent my entire...

1503
01:26:30,375 --> 01:26:31,875
Not everyone gets a speech.

1504
01:26:33,833 --> 01:26:34,833
She's gonna die.

1505
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,458
Okay. Hey, hey. If I take this helmet off...

1506
01:26:36,625 --> 01:26:38,417
- do you promise you won't kill us?
- Fuck!

1507
01:26:38,583 --> 01:26:39,417
I promise...

1508
01:26:39,583 --> 01:26:41,375
I will kill you first thing.

1509
01:26:41,542 --> 01:26:42,792
Why are you like this?

1510
01:26:42,958 --> 01:26:44,208
I wish I knew.

1511
01:26:44,375 --> 01:26:45,250
Take it off.

1512
01:26:45,417 --> 01:26:46,292
- What?
- Take it off.

1513
01:26:46,458 --> 01:26:47,292
- Why?
- Just take it off.

1514
01:26:47,458 --> 01:26:50,208
- This is our only chance to fix our shit!
- Take it off!

1515
01:26:52,125 --> 01:26:53,375
I am wearing this suit.

1516
01:26:54,583 --> 01:26:56,708
And that means a lot of things,
but most of all...

1517
01:26:58,208 --> 01:26:59,333
it means I'm an X-Man.

1518
01:27:00,458 --> 01:27:01,875
And I know your brother.

1519
01:27:04,208 --> 01:27:05,708
As much as I want to fucking kill you...

1520
01:27:05,875 --> 01:27:08,375
every bone in my body
wants to fucking kill you...

1521
01:27:08,542 --> 01:27:11,542
he would not let me stand here
and watch you die!

1522
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,208
Take your hands off.

1523
01:27:16,875 --> 01:27:18,125
This is for him.

1524
01:27:20,042 --> 01:27:21,292
This is for Charles.

1525
01:27:31,917 --> 01:27:34,542
Hey, no, no, no!
Don't you dare do me like Johnny!

1526
01:27:40,875 --> 01:27:41,958
My brother loved you.

1527
01:27:43,833 --> 01:27:44,917
He loved all of us.

1528
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,083
Must be nice.

1529
01:27:50,208 --> 01:27:51,500
He would've loved you, too.

1530
01:27:54,375 --> 01:27:55,542
If he knew about you...

1531
01:27:57,333 --> 01:27:58,833
if he knew where you were...

1532
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:02,042
he would've torn a hole in the fucking
universe to bring you home.

1533
01:28:05,875 --> 01:28:06,958
This is my home.

1534
01:28:08,042 --> 01:28:10,292
Well, then at least let us save his.

1535
01:28:14,458 --> 01:28:15,958
You want to hear something crazy?

1536
01:28:17,917 --> 01:28:20,792
An amateur magician
rolled through here a while back.

1537
01:28:21,708 --> 01:28:23,167
I killed him, of course.

1538
01:28:23,875 --> 01:28:26,125
Wore his skin around for four days.

1539
01:28:27,167 --> 01:28:28,000
But...

1540
01:28:28,167 --> 01:28:29,583
I found this...

1541
01:28:29,750 --> 01:28:31,583
little trinket...

1542
01:28:31,750 --> 01:28:33,875
on his lovely fingers.

1543
01:28:34,042 --> 01:28:35,208
Strange!

1544
01:28:38,292 --> 01:28:40,417
- Marvel sparkle circle.
- What is that?

1545
01:28:41,333 --> 01:28:43,250
This is your way home.

1546
01:28:43,417 --> 01:28:46,875
I do owe you for saving my life.
But let's keep things interesting.

1547
01:28:47,042 --> 01:28:50,333
I'd say you have about four seconds
before you're Alioth's food.

1548
01:28:55,208 --> 01:28:56,042
Race ya.

1549
01:30:19,625 --> 01:30:21,208
{\an8}And as I said
we've got a standard three-year...

1550
01:30:21,375 --> 01:30:22,667
{\an8}bumper to bumper warranty.

1551
01:30:22,833 --> 01:30:24,583
Glad you gave us a second chance.

1552
01:30:24,750 --> 01:30:28,292
And don't worry. Wade and I are a team,
so I'll see he gets half the commission...

1553
01:30:30,875 --> 01:30:33,083
That feels like a Kia.

1554
01:30:33,250 --> 01:30:34,875
It's a fucking Kia Carnival, isn't it?

1555
01:30:36,750 --> 01:30:39,583
Holy shit. That's Deadpool.

1556
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:40,875
And that's Wolverine.

1557
01:30:41,042 --> 01:30:42,125
You're damn straight it is.

1558
01:30:42,292 --> 01:30:43,208
Fox killed him.

1559
01:30:43,375 --> 01:30:45,917
Disney brought him back. They're going
to make him do this 'til he's 90.

1560
01:30:46,458 --> 01:30:47,417
Let's go.

1561
01:30:48,208 --> 01:30:49,292
I'll clock you out!

1562
01:30:49,667 --> 01:30:50,875
Forever!

1563
01:30:51,583 --> 01:30:52,583
Forever.

1564
01:30:59,958 --> 01:31:01,167
Wakey-wakey.

1565
01:31:01,333 --> 01:31:02,333
God?

1566
01:31:04,083 --> 01:31:06,792
Now you put all these bullets in my belly...

1567
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:09,042
and I'm gonna find out why.

1568
01:31:11,458 --> 01:31:12,833
I'll just say it.

1569
01:31:13,542 --> 01:31:15,333
You don't have to stick your fingers in me.

1570
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:17,750
Jesus, just ask sometimes.

1571
01:31:18,125 --> 01:31:19,167
Fine.

1572
01:31:20,375 --> 01:31:21,375
Really?

1573
01:31:22,042 --> 01:31:23,292
Hands in pockets.

1574
01:31:24,833 --> 01:31:26,000
Guy named Paradox.

1575
01:31:26,917 --> 01:31:28,167
He said he'd get me out of The Void.

1576
01:31:28,333 --> 01:31:30,125
All I know is he works for the TVA.

1577
01:31:30,292 --> 01:31:31,292
The TVA.

1578
01:31:31,458 --> 01:31:32,500
We had an agreement.

1579
01:31:32,792 --> 01:31:34,333
I don't think this guy cares.

1580
01:31:35,625 --> 01:31:36,667
He will.

1581
01:31:37,167 --> 01:31:38,208
Hey, people!

1582
01:31:38,542 --> 01:31:40,667
How much longer
before the Time Ripper is active?

1583
01:31:40,833 --> 01:31:42,667
We're running the final safety checks.

1584
01:31:42,833 --> 01:31:44,792
Okay. All right.
Thanks for all your hard work, Ralph.

1585
01:31:44,958 --> 01:31:46,333
- Take your time.
- Really?

1586
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:48,042
No, you drooling boob!

1587
01:31:48,208 --> 01:31:49,292
No! We have company.

1588
01:31:49,458 --> 01:31:52,458
Cancel the safety checks.
We need to be live now!

1589
01:31:52,792 --> 01:31:54,250
I hate you so much.

1590
01:31:56,458 --> 01:31:57,458
No! Stop!

1591
01:31:57,625 --> 01:31:59,208
Piss off! You're too late.

1592
01:31:59,375 --> 01:32:01,125
- You're fuckin' done.
- Why was Thor crying?

1593
01:32:01,292 --> 01:32:02,292
How dare you!

1594
01:32:02,458 --> 01:32:04,625
No one comes back from The Void.

1595
01:32:04,792 --> 01:32:06,250
Tell that to Cassandra Nova.

1596
01:32:15,083 --> 01:32:16,875
Paradox.
We have a problem.

1597
01:32:19,958 --> 01:32:21,167
Paradox.

1598
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:25,958
Well, you are doughier than
you looked in Pyro's head.

1599
01:32:26,125 --> 01:32:27,292
You tried to kill me.

1600
01:32:27,458 --> 01:32:28,458
I literally have no...

1601
01:32:29,417 --> 01:32:33,083
<i>You come for the king,
you better kill the king.</i>

1602
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,375
Welcome to the skull fuck club, Paradox.

1603
01:32:36,542 --> 01:32:38,667
You know she doesn't wash that hand.

1604
01:32:40,417 --> 01:32:41,542
What's this?

1605
01:32:42,875 --> 01:32:44,208
A Time Ripper?

1606
01:32:44,375 --> 01:32:46,083
- Naughty boy.
- Oh, no. We're on it.

1607
01:32:46,250 --> 01:32:47,875
We're gonna head down
and dismantle that thing now.

1608
01:32:48,042 --> 01:32:50,333
We got ya, boo.
You just keep playing those keys.

1609
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:52,000
I don't want to destroy it.

1610
01:32:52,667 --> 01:32:54,000
I want to use it.

1611
01:32:54,542 --> 01:32:57,042
Now, shoo.
Mummy and Daddy are having a conversation.

1612
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:05,542
You know, the funny thing is...

1613
01:33:05,708 --> 01:33:07,167
I was happy in The Void.

1614
01:33:08,208 --> 01:33:11,125
You sent your trash to me.
Alioth and I cleaned it up.

1615
01:33:11,292 --> 01:33:13,250
Everyone was happy.

1616
01:33:14,125 --> 01:33:17,208
And then you had to go
and piss on my side of the fence.

1617
01:33:17,375 --> 01:33:19,542
And so now the fence must come down.

1618
01:33:20,250 --> 01:33:22,083
I'm going to use your little Time Ripper.

1619
01:33:22,250 --> 01:33:24,833
And I'm going to destroy this universe...

1620
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,708
and the next and the next and the next...

1621
01:33:27,875 --> 01:33:31,458
until all that's left is The Void.

1622
01:33:31,625 --> 01:33:33,500
And I get to play God.

1623
01:33:34,042 --> 01:33:35,042
Come on.

1624
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:38,333
Now you're going to show me how
to use this fancy gadget of yours.

1625
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:41,875
And don't worry, I've called some friends
to make sure we're not disturbed.

1626
01:33:45,458 --> 01:33:48,000
Sorry to bother, madam,
but there's something you need to see.

1627
01:33:48,542 --> 01:33:52,542
We're getting indications of an unsanctioned
Time Ripper activating on Earth-10005.

1628
01:33:54,833 --> 01:33:56,042
Whose district is that?

1629
01:33:56,417 --> 01:33:57,333
Paradox.

1630
01:34:09,375 --> 01:34:11,583
Well, thank you so much
for your help, darling.

1631
01:34:11,750 --> 01:34:14,167
God. Good to get out of that head.

1632
01:34:14,333 --> 01:34:15,833
What a mess!

1633
01:34:23,167 --> 01:34:24,000
Stop!

1634
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:26,500
Let's give it a beat for the extras to clear.

1635
01:34:26,667 --> 01:34:28,708
Go, go, go!
Oh, my God!

1636
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:36,167
- Oh. My. God.
- Fuck.

1637
01:34:43,917 --> 01:34:45,292
It's her!

1638
01:34:46,542 --> 01:34:47,667
Come on, girl!

1639
01:34:55,083 --> 01:34:56,292
Come on, girl!

1640
01:35:11,042 --> 01:35:12,167
That's my girl!

1641
01:35:12,333 --> 01:35:15,625
We don't have to be apart ever, ever again.
Never, ever...

1642
01:35:15,792 --> 01:35:16,875
- Sorry!
- Fuck!

1643
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,792
What's Café Gratitude doing here?

1644
01:35:19,958 --> 01:35:21,208
Sorry about that.

1645
01:35:21,375 --> 01:35:24,708
Tremble not, sweet Mary Puppins.
I'll handle him.

1646
01:35:25,333 --> 01:35:26,375
Come here, girl.
Papa's here.

1647
01:35:26,542 --> 01:35:28,958
Hey, do not insult
this animal's autonomy.

1648
01:35:29,667 --> 01:35:31,708
She can decide who her papa is.

1649
01:35:31,875 --> 01:35:32,917
What's it gonna be, girl, huh?

1650
01:35:33,083 --> 01:35:35,583
Original recipe or Van Milder here?

1651
01:35:36,208 --> 01:35:39,083
That's funny.
I can gently tap the fourth wall too.

1652
01:35:39,583 --> 01:35:40,750
<i>The Proposal.</i>

1653
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:43,500
The fuck was that?

1654
01:35:43,667 --> 01:35:45,833
- Bitch, you think that's what I do?
- Both of you shut up.

1655
01:35:47,333 --> 01:35:48,333
You smell somethin'?

1656
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:49,333
Yeah, you.

1657
01:35:50,208 --> 01:35:51,792
A lot of you.

1658
01:36:06,958 --> 01:36:09,208
Told you there were
a lot of Deadpools over there.

1659
01:36:20,750 --> 01:36:21,917
That's bad.

1660
01:36:44,417 --> 01:36:45,583
I take it they're not friendly.

1661
01:36:45,750 --> 01:36:46,625
Goodness, no.

1662
01:36:46,792 --> 01:36:48,833
Sorry about this, boys.
Mission over.

1663
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,667
Cause of death,
one hundred kill-thirsty Deadpools.

1664
01:36:51,833 --> 01:36:52,917
They're dumb.

1665
01:36:53,083 --> 01:36:54,833
But they can fight.
Not me, though.

1666
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,208
Would love to get in the mix
but I have low bone density...

1667
01:36:57,375 --> 01:36:58,875
and I have to keep my face safe.

1668
01:36:59,833 --> 01:37:00,833
- Hold, please.
- Oh, God.

1669
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,208
All right. Look.

1670
01:37:02,875 --> 01:37:03,875
Guys!

1671
01:37:05,083 --> 01:37:06,833
Deadpool Prime here.

1672
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,458
- Our fight isn't with you...
- Hey!

1673
01:37:08,625 --> 01:37:12,250
When I want your opinion,
I'll take Wolverine's dick out of your mouth.

1674
01:37:12,417 --> 01:37:14,000
That's Kidpool.
She's the dirtiest.

1675
01:37:14,167 --> 01:37:15,417
Can we just be done?

1676
01:37:15,583 --> 01:37:17,125
We're just getting started.

1677
01:37:17,292 --> 01:37:20,583
No, no, no. With the whole multiverse thing.

1678
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:22,500
It's not great.

1679
01:37:22,667 --> 01:37:24,125
It's just been miss...

1680
01:37:24,583 --> 01:37:26,083
after miss...

1681
01:37:26,250 --> 01:37:27,958
after miss.

1682
01:37:28,333 --> 01:37:30,667
Look, <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>
did the multiverse first...

1683
01:37:30,833 --> 01:37:33,125
and they did it best.
The gays knew it.

1684
01:37:33,583 --> 01:37:34,833
But we didn't listen.

1685
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,750
Let's just take the L and move on.

1686
01:37:37,917 --> 01:37:40,250
I think it's been steadily great
since <i>Endgame.</i>

1687
01:37:40,417 --> 01:37:41,875
What are you talking about?

1688
01:37:42,042 --> 01:37:43,500
The multiverse is over.

1689
01:37:43,667 --> 01:37:46,542
Cassandy gonna destroy
the fuck outta every timeline.

1690
01:37:46,708 --> 01:37:49,000
- Y'all can't do shit about it.
- Do you not get it?

1691
01:37:49,167 --> 01:37:51,375
If we don't go down to the subway
and stop her, we all die.

1692
01:37:51,542 --> 01:37:53,792
Say, the boss lady don't want
no disturbances.

1693
01:37:53,958 --> 01:37:56,667
You wanna get down to the subway,
you gotta go through us.

1694
01:37:56,833 --> 01:37:57,792
Uzi time, baby.

1695
01:37:58,083 --> 01:37:59,083
Uzi time, baby.

1696
01:37:59,250 --> 01:38:00,250
Look alive!

1697
01:38:09,708 --> 01:38:11,375
- I think I'm hit.
- No shit.

1698
01:38:11,542 --> 01:38:12,458
You did that on purpose.

1699
01:38:12,625 --> 01:38:14,167
I did no such thing!

1700
01:38:14,333 --> 01:38:15,333
Listen to me, gorgeous.

1701
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:16,750
How long does it take for you to regenerate?

1702
01:38:16,917 --> 01:38:18,167
Regenerate?

1703
01:38:24,375 --> 01:38:26,167
You really are God's perfect idiot,
aren't you?

1704
01:38:26,333 --> 01:38:27,708
- I'm okay.
- How dare you!

1705
01:38:27,875 --> 01:38:29,792
You insensitive son of a bitch!

1706
01:38:29,958 --> 01:38:31,875
How was I supposed to know
he doesn't regenerate?

1707
01:38:32,042 --> 01:38:33,167
I'm not a medicine woman.

1708
01:38:33,625 --> 01:38:34,875
Look. A donut cart.

1709
01:38:35,042 --> 01:38:36,125
- They're practically hospitals.
- What?

1710
01:38:36,292 --> 01:38:38,125
- They sell portable triage units.
- They don't.

1711
01:38:38,292 --> 01:38:39,833
- I'm gonna get you to safety.
- He's not.

1712
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,167
Deep breath.

1713
01:38:49,542 --> 01:38:51,542
Hey, why are we stopping?

1714
01:38:51,708 --> 01:38:52,917
I'm just catching my breath.

1715
01:38:53,083 --> 01:38:55,667
What, are your legs on vacation?
You're dead weight!

1716
01:38:55,833 --> 01:38:57,417
That's because I'm paralyzed.

1717
01:38:57,583 --> 01:38:59,583
We all have problems.
Listen to me.

1718
01:38:59,750 --> 01:39:00,750
You're gonna live.

1719
01:39:01,875 --> 01:39:03,125
Look at me, Nicepool.

1720
01:39:07,083 --> 01:39:08,250
You're gonna live.

1721
01:39:08,958 --> 01:39:10,208
Say it!

1722
01:39:10,750 --> 01:39:12,083
I'm gonna live.

1723
01:39:12,375 --> 01:39:14,417
Say it with me.
You're gonna live.

1724
01:39:14,583 --> 01:39:16,750
I'm gonna live!

1725
01:39:18,083 --> 01:39:20,125
Say it louder!

1726
01:39:20,292 --> 01:39:21,458
I'm gonna live...

1727
01:39:30,375 --> 01:39:31,375
Hold your fire!

1728
01:39:33,708 --> 01:39:35,000
Sweet little puppy.

1729
01:39:45,833 --> 01:39:48,292
God damn it!
I don't think he's gonna make it.

1730
01:39:48,458 --> 01:39:50,542
God, he loved his face.

1731
01:39:50,708 --> 01:39:53,083
I can taste his final thought.

1732
01:39:53,250 --> 01:39:54,792
He was so afraid.

1733
01:39:54,958 --> 01:39:55,917
But he died a hero.

1734
01:39:56,083 --> 01:39:58,000
He died from murder, you dumb fuck.

1735
01:39:58,167 --> 01:39:59,958
And all I have to remember him by...

1736
01:40:00,875 --> 01:40:04,542
are these two gold-plated,
...50 caliber Desert Eagle pistoleros.

1737
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:05,958
This is for him.

1738
01:40:06,583 --> 01:40:07,750
Are you ready?

1739
01:40:08,333 --> 01:40:10,083
I get to kill a hundred yous?

1740
01:40:10,250 --> 01:40:11,458
Fuck yeah, I'm ready.

1741
01:40:12,542 --> 01:40:13,833
Hey, you don't want to see this, bub.

1742
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,292
That's a good girl.

1743
01:40:52,208 --> 01:40:53,583
Holy shit.

1744
01:40:53,750 --> 01:40:55,833
You save the good stuff
for special occasions?

1745
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,250
Killing mostly.

1746
01:40:57,417 --> 01:40:59,750
What's the wind resistance
on those blowjob handles?

1747
01:41:01,042 --> 01:41:04,292
I'm sorry.
I'm just a catty bitch when I'm jealous.

1748
01:41:04,458 --> 01:41:05,708
All right, let's do this.

1749
01:41:06,083 --> 01:41:07,292
Maximum effort.

1750
01:41:46,958 --> 01:41:48,042
You're dead.

1751
01:42:13,917 --> 01:42:15,167
Motherfucker.

1752
01:42:16,083 --> 01:42:17,708
I wish I were deaf.

1753
01:42:37,542 --> 01:42:39,375
I don't wanna die. I don't wanna die.

1754
01:42:39,542 --> 01:42:40,583
I don't wanna...

1755
01:42:54,250 --> 01:42:55,417
Come on.

1756
01:42:55,583 --> 01:42:56,583
I blew it.

1757
01:42:56,750 --> 01:42:58,792
After all that, the only thing
they're gonna remember...

1758
01:42:58,958 --> 01:43:00,667
is that God awful dismount!

1759
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:07,000
What you laughing at,
you little fucker?

1760
01:43:07,333 --> 01:43:08,458
Uh-oh.

1761
01:43:08,625 --> 01:43:09,667
Uh-oh.

1762
01:43:13,875 --> 01:43:15,458
I guess these ones regenerate.

1763
01:43:17,583 --> 01:43:19,958
Come on. We don't have time for this.

1764
01:43:20,125 --> 01:43:21,167
Deadpools!

1765
01:43:21,333 --> 01:43:22,417
Stand down.

1766
01:43:32,917 --> 01:43:34,417
This Deadpool's with me.

1767
01:43:34,583 --> 01:43:35,792
Oh, no.

1768
01:43:35,958 --> 01:43:37,167
Holy shit.

1769
01:43:37,333 --> 01:43:38,542
That's fuckin' Peter!

1770
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:43,583
Wait, you...
You guys know Peter?

1771
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:45,875
You kidding me? Every Deadpool has a Peter.

1772
01:43:46,042 --> 01:43:49,625
Shit. Peter's a goddamn legend
in every Deadpool's world.

1773
01:43:49,792 --> 01:43:50,875
Peter<i>-san.</i>

1774
01:43:59,250 --> 01:44:01,333
Peter. Peter. Peter.

1775
01:44:07,375 --> 01:44:08,917
Enjoy my Peter.

1776
01:44:36,458 --> 01:44:38,917
Oh, now you're here.
Oh, well, you're too late. It's all over.

1777
01:44:39,083 --> 01:44:39,917
Not yet, it's not.

1778
01:44:40,083 --> 01:44:41,750
Whoa. No, no, no. We're very close.

1779
01:44:41,917 --> 01:44:43,250
Homestretch, folks. Promise.

1780
01:44:43,417 --> 01:44:44,917
Quick, let's up the stakes.

1781
01:44:45,083 --> 01:44:46,417
If she steals the Time Ripper's energy...

1782
01:44:46,583 --> 01:44:49,042
she has the power to
shred the fabric of all realities...

1783
01:44:49,208 --> 01:44:50,833
until there is nothing left but The Void.

1784
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:51,958
How do we shut it down?

1785
01:44:52,375 --> 01:44:53,292
I don't know.

1786
01:44:55,042 --> 01:44:56,125
How about now?

1787
01:44:56,292 --> 01:44:57,625
The mask is really intimidating, huh?

1788
01:44:57,792 --> 01:44:59,792
It's like Batman,
except he can move his neck.

1789
01:44:59,958 --> 01:45:01,375
Okay, look, look, look.

1790
01:45:02,833 --> 01:45:05,208
The Ripper is fed from
a secure chamber below ground.

1791
01:45:05,375 --> 01:45:09,500
It is powered by twin matter and anti-matter
feeds converging inside the device.

1792
01:45:09,667 --> 01:45:10,792
<i>Now, Cassandra Nova...</i>

1793
01:45:10,958 --> 01:45:13,125
<i>is redirecting the Ripper's power
to eliminate all timelines...</i>

1794
01:45:13,292 --> 01:45:14,292
starting with this one.

1795
01:45:14,458 --> 01:45:15,792
Theoretically, you could stop her...

1796
01:45:15,958 --> 01:45:17,792
by short-circuiting the feeds
in the chamber below.

1797
01:45:17,958 --> 01:45:20,333
One of you were to create a
circuit between the two feeds...

1798
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:23,708
then the released power
would destroy the machine.

1799
01:45:23,875 --> 01:45:25,667
- But, well, but...
- Come on, man.

1800
01:45:25,833 --> 01:45:27,833
If you're not gonna swallow, spit it out.

1801
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,042
Whoever formed the bridge
would be annihilated.

1802
01:45:31,208 --> 01:45:32,833
- I could live with that.
- Yeah, I could live with that, too, actually.

1803
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,708
You know, we survive anything.
We're like cockroaches.

1804
01:45:34,875 --> 01:45:35,792
Not this time.

1805
01:45:35,958 --> 01:45:38,625
This is matter and anti-matter.

1806
01:45:38,792 --> 01:45:40,708
They do not play nicely with each other.

1807
01:45:40,875 --> 01:45:43,625
When they mix in your body
you will be atomized.

1808
01:45:44,208 --> 01:45:46,208
Trust the laws of physics
if you don't trust me.

1809
01:45:46,375 --> 01:45:48,417
Even if you lived long enough to
make the circuit...

1810
01:45:48,583 --> 01:45:51,125
you will die down there.

1811
01:46:16,458 --> 01:46:17,792
Hold off. Hold.

1812
01:46:17,958 --> 01:46:19,458
You heard that asshole upstairs.

1813
01:46:19,625 --> 01:46:23,667
Even if we pull this off,
we're dead. Permanently.

1814
01:46:24,292 --> 01:46:25,333
That's why it's got to be me.

1815
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:26,333
What?

1816
01:46:30,250 --> 01:46:31,083
Look, man...

1817
01:46:32,333 --> 01:46:34,083
you didn't ask for any of this.

1818
01:46:34,542 --> 01:46:35,667
You were right.

1819
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:36,917
I lied.

1820
01:46:37,875 --> 01:46:39,583
I lied right to your face...

1821
01:46:39,750 --> 01:46:41,625
just to get you to help me. And you did.

1822
01:46:42,542 --> 01:46:44,000
You didn't lie.

1823
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,375
You made an educated wish.

1824
01:46:50,458 --> 01:46:51,292
Come on.

1825
01:46:52,708 --> 01:46:54,458
You got a whole world to go back to.

1826
01:46:56,125 --> 01:46:56,958
I got nothin'.

1827
01:46:59,292 --> 01:47:00,125
I got nothin'.

1828
01:47:05,375 --> 01:47:06,208
Give me this.

1829
01:47:13,375 --> 01:47:14,583
Hey.

1830
01:47:19,083 --> 01:47:20,917
I waited a long time for this team up.

1831
01:47:23,208 --> 01:47:24,167
You know something?

1832
01:47:26,208 --> 01:47:27,708
You were the best Wolverine.

1833
01:47:36,583 --> 01:47:38,375
Say hi to your friends for me.

1834
01:47:50,458 --> 01:47:51,542
No!

1835
01:47:51,708 --> 01:47:52,667
Open the door!

1836
01:47:52,833 --> 01:47:55,458
I can't hear you over all the
noble sacrifice.

1837
01:47:55,625 --> 01:47:56,750
Why are you fucking doing this?

1838
01:47:56,917 --> 01:48:00,042
Because I'm Marvel Jesus.

1839
01:48:01,750 --> 01:48:02,750
Or Spock.

1840
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Hard to say.

1841
01:48:09,625 --> 01:48:10,458
Wade!

1842
01:48:11,208 --> 01:48:13,167
You fucking idiot!

1843
01:48:18,333 --> 01:48:19,458
Sorry, I'm just stalling.

1844
01:48:19,625 --> 01:48:21,917
I think I'm nervous about dying.

1845
01:48:22,750 --> 01:48:23,875
This should be me.

1846
01:48:24,583 --> 01:48:26,250
Say hi to my friends for me, peanut.

1847
01:48:26,417 --> 01:48:27,417
Wade!

1848
01:48:27,583 --> 01:48:29,625
You want to be an annoying prick,
do it this side!

1849
01:48:29,792 --> 01:48:31,833
You're gonna die in there,
you dumb fuck!

1850
01:48:38,833 --> 01:48:40,500
Hey! You don't need to do this.

1851
01:48:40,917 --> 01:48:42,542
I'm not doing it 'cause I need it.

1852
01:48:43,583 --> 01:48:45,583
I'm doing it because they do.

1853
01:48:56,542 --> 01:48:57,792
No!

1854
01:49:27,125 --> 01:49:28,625
He's not gonna make it.

1855
01:49:37,333 --> 01:49:38,417
It's over.

1856
01:50:45,875 --> 01:50:47,208
<i>The Wolverine.</i>

1857
01:50:48,292 --> 01:50:50,083
<i>He's a hero in my world.</i>

1858
01:50:52,375 --> 01:50:54,875
<i>Whoever you think I am,
you got the wrong guy.</i>

1859
01:50:56,417 --> 01:50:58,167
<i>You were always the wrong guy...</i>

1860
01:50:59,708 --> 01:51:01,333
<i>till you weren't.</i>

1861
01:51:03,375 --> 01:51:04,875
<i>Wade.</i>

1862
01:51:06,792 --> 01:51:11,375
<i>Wade. You can finally, finally, matter.</i>

1863
01:51:27,417 --> 01:51:28,417
Vanessa.

1864
01:51:30,875 --> 01:51:32,708
<i>I wanna see Vanessa.</i>

1865
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:43,208
For the first time in my life,
I am proud to wear this suit.

1866
01:51:44,417 --> 01:51:46,083
<i>It means I'm an X-Man.</i>

1867
01:51:48,583 --> 01:51:50,167
I am the X-Man.

1868
01:52:34,208 --> 01:52:35,750
Paradox.

1869
01:52:37,583 --> 01:52:38,750
You've been busy.

1870
01:52:39,167 --> 01:52:40,208
Well, somebody had to be.

1871
01:52:40,375 --> 01:52:42,333
We had some
strange readings from this location.

1872
01:52:42,500 --> 01:52:45,292
You wouldn't know anything about an
unsanctioned Time Ripper, would you?

1873
01:52:46,333 --> 01:52:49,458
No. No. I wouldn't know anything about an
unsanctioned Time Ripper.

1874
01:52:49,625 --> 01:52:51,125
Maybe you should ask Cassandra Nova.

1875
01:52:51,292 --> 01:52:52,208
Because I was assured...

1876
01:52:52,375 --> 01:52:54,875
that she was safely held in The Void.
But no...

1877
01:52:55,042 --> 01:52:57,083
she was here.
And she fondled my brain.

1878
01:52:57,250 --> 01:52:58,167
How did you let this happen?

1879
01:52:58,333 --> 01:52:59,208
You weren't involved at all?

1880
01:52:59,375 --> 01:53:01,875
In stopping her, yes!
Yes. I was.

1881
01:53:02,042 --> 01:53:03,583
But, not nearly enough.

1882
01:53:03,750 --> 01:53:05,958
Not as much as the men
who went down there after her.

1883
01:53:06,625 --> 01:53:07,708
My men.

1884
01:53:08,458 --> 01:53:09,458
My friends.

1885
01:53:10,875 --> 01:53:11,833
I warned them.

1886
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:15,167
That they would be completely obliterated
if they went. But they went anyway. Like...

1887
01:53:16,958 --> 01:53:18,042
Like heroes.

1888
01:53:20,167 --> 01:53:21,833
Because that's who they were.

1889
01:53:24,708 --> 01:53:26,125
They just did what they had to do.

1890
01:53:27,542 --> 01:53:29,125
With no concern for their own safety.

1891
01:53:32,375 --> 01:53:38,958
The fact that we are all still standing here
is a testament to their heroism.

1892
01:53:42,667 --> 01:53:45,042
Anyway, there's nothing you or I can do
to bring them back now.

1893
01:53:46,875 --> 01:53:48,875
He has risen, baby girl.

1894
01:53:49,042 --> 01:53:49,833
Fuck!

1895
01:54:09,333 --> 01:54:10,542
Found your new Anchor Being.

1896
01:54:11,042 --> 01:54:13,000
And we're doing just fine, you piece of shit.

1897
01:54:13,417 --> 01:54:14,500
Mm. Mm-hmm.

1898
01:54:14,875 --> 01:54:16,333
Fine indeed.

1899
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:20,500
All right. Put your greasy tits away,
you preening slut.

1900
01:54:21,375 --> 01:54:22,750
I don't understand.

1901
01:54:22,917 --> 01:54:24,083
How are you two still alive?

1902
01:54:24,250 --> 01:54:26,333
You were right.
One of us would have been killed.

1903
01:54:26,500 --> 01:54:29,458
But you put
a Deadpool and a Wolverine together...

1904
01:54:29,625 --> 01:54:31,708
make 'em hold hands
while listening to Madonna...

1905
01:54:31,875 --> 01:54:33,958
indestructible, motherfucker.

1906
01:54:34,458 --> 01:54:36,667
Let's get this Deadpool Variant
back to The Void.

1907
01:54:36,833 --> 01:54:38,667
- Wait, hold on. What?
- Nope. Actually...

1908
01:54:38,833 --> 01:54:40,375
This one's homegrown, like me.

1909
01:54:40,542 --> 01:54:41,625
He belongs here.

1910
01:54:42,083 --> 01:54:43,000
And you are?

1911
01:54:43,167 --> 01:54:45,708
Peterpool. But you can call me Peter.

1912
01:54:47,333 --> 01:54:48,375
And I hope that you do.

1913
01:54:54,875 --> 01:54:56,292
What the fuck is happening here?

1914
01:54:56,458 --> 01:54:58,125
You are under judgment...

1915
01:54:58,292 --> 01:55:00,167
for operating an unsanctioned Time Ripper.

1916
01:55:00,333 --> 01:55:01,417
- Take him.
- I was just doing what...

1917
01:55:01,583 --> 01:55:02,958
you don't have the guts to do.

1918
01:55:03,750 --> 01:55:05,958
Get your insolent hands off me!

1919
01:55:06,125 --> 01:55:06,958
Get off!

1920
01:55:08,208 --> 01:55:09,875
I'm grateful, gentlemen.

1921
01:55:10,708 --> 01:55:11,792
Let's hold the bows.

1922
01:55:11,958 --> 01:55:14,375
You led an
Omega-level mutant to this timeline.

1923
01:55:14,542 --> 01:55:16,125
- You're welcome.
- And you...

1924
01:55:16,292 --> 01:55:18,167
- shouldn't even be near this timeline.
- He's welcome.

1925
01:55:18,458 --> 01:55:21,708
And you look damn good in that suit.

1926
01:55:21,875 --> 01:55:22,875
I'm so sorry.

1927
01:55:27,375 --> 01:55:31,000
I wanna show you something.
Something huge.

1928
01:55:31,167 --> 01:55:33,083
That's what Scoutmaster Kevin used to say.

1929
01:55:34,708 --> 01:55:35,708
Do you see that?

1930
01:55:36,458 --> 01:55:38,208
Your universe is regenerating.

1931
01:55:39,125 --> 01:55:40,458
Whatever you did here...

1932
01:55:40,875 --> 01:55:42,750
you not only saved your world.

1933
01:55:43,292 --> 01:55:45,667
You spared your timeline from extinction.

1934
01:55:47,500 --> 01:55:48,583
I'd rest up.

1935
01:55:48,958 --> 01:55:51,333
I have a feeling your work
is only just getting started.

1936
01:55:51,500 --> 01:55:53,042
Till you're 90.

1937
01:55:53,208 --> 01:55:54,042
Wait!

1938
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:58,208
We couldn't have made it out of The Void
without some help...

1939
01:55:59,042 --> 01:56:02,917
from some people that the world
kind of forgot.

1940
01:56:03,417 --> 01:56:06,792
Is there any way that you could maybe find
a way to bring them home?

1941
01:56:08,875 --> 01:56:09,958
I'll see what I can do.

1942
01:56:10,708 --> 01:56:12,583
And I promised my friend here...

1943
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:16,542
that the TVA could undo some
pretty awful shit in his timeline.

1944
01:56:16,708 --> 01:56:17,667
What would you say to that?

1945
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,042
Change the past?

1946
01:56:19,667 --> 01:56:21,625
Well, he did help me save the world.

1947
01:56:21,958 --> 01:56:24,292
And his past made him the man who did it.

1948
01:56:25,375 --> 01:56:27,625
There's nothing to fix, Mr. Wilson.

1949
01:56:29,083 --> 01:56:30,125
Logan.

1950
01:56:33,625 --> 01:56:34,417
Shawarma?

1951
01:56:34,583 --> 01:56:35,417
- I could eat.
- Yeah.

1952
01:56:45,250 --> 01:56:47,542
You know, the Avengers discovered shawarma.

1953
01:56:48,542 --> 01:56:50,167
They'd be lucky to have you.

1954
01:56:57,542 --> 01:56:59,542
- Oh.
- Oh, come on.

1955
01:56:59,708 --> 01:57:00,750
Fuck off!

1956
01:57:01,917 --> 01:57:06,625
Come here, my little cunchkin.
Yes, it's you. You're a survivor.

1957
01:57:08,042 --> 01:57:09,833
Oh, all is right in the world.

1958
01:57:11,125 --> 01:57:12,125
Yes, it is.

1959
01:57:13,917 --> 01:57:15,083
So what are you gonna do next?

1960
01:57:16,708 --> 01:57:18,708
I'll figure it out. I always do.

1961
01:57:19,583 --> 01:57:20,417
All right.

1962
01:57:21,750 --> 01:57:23,000
So I'll probably see you around?

1963
01:57:28,042 --> 01:57:28,875
Probably not.

1964
01:57:32,375 --> 01:57:33,208
See you, bub.

1965
01:57:42,958 --> 01:57:43,958
Logan.

1966
01:57:50,542 --> 01:57:52,208
Al. I'm back.

1967
01:57:52,792 --> 01:57:54,042
About damn time.

1968
01:57:54,417 --> 01:57:55,250
You holdin'?

1969
01:57:55,417 --> 01:57:57,167
I'm all outta devil's dandruff...

1970
01:57:57,333 --> 01:58:00,042
- and I'm shaking like an angry vibrator.
- Thank you, Al.

1971
01:58:00,208 --> 01:58:01,083
We have company.

1972
01:58:01,958 --> 01:58:03,458
Althea, this is...

1973
01:58:04,208 --> 01:58:05,250
This is Logan.

1974
01:58:05,417 --> 01:58:06,458
Nice to meet you, Logan.

1975
01:58:06,625 --> 01:58:07,458
Nice to meet you, too.

1976
01:58:07,625 --> 01:58:11,167
And this little ancient anal shit-knot is
Mary Puppins.

1977
01:58:11,333 --> 01:58:13,625
Or as I like to call her, Dogpool.

1978
01:58:13,792 --> 01:58:15,458
You want to treat yourself
to a little stroke?

1979
01:58:17,125 --> 01:58:20,167
- Get the tongue. There it is.
- Oh, my God! Motherfucker!

1980
01:58:20,333 --> 01:58:24,042
Right? It's like an armadillo
fucked a gremlin, angrily...

1981
01:58:24,208 --> 01:58:25,500
in a bed of gonorrhea...

1982
01:58:25,667 --> 01:58:28,042
- Wow.
- ...and didn't stop till the sun came up.

1983
01:58:29,333 --> 01:58:30,917
<i>Everyone wants to matter.</i>

1984
01:58:31,833 --> 01:58:34,458
<i>Turns out that
you don't need to be Marvel Jesus to do it.</i>

1985
01:58:35,292 --> 01:58:37,542
<i>You just need to
open your eyes and look around.</i>

1986
01:58:38,250 --> 01:58:39,250
<i>And if you're lucky...</i>

1987
01:58:40,250 --> 01:58:41,667
<i>you'll find a few friends.</i>

1988
01:58:42,125 --> 01:58:43,250
<i>Old friends...</i>

1989
01:58:44,250 --> 01:58:45,958
<i>and some new ones too.</i>

1990
01:58:50,667 --> 01:58:52,625
Give me the fucking dog. Talk to the girl.

1991
01:59:03,083 --> 01:59:04,208
Well, hi.

1992
01:59:04,375 --> 01:59:05,208
Hi.

1993
01:59:08,042 --> 01:59:09,042
You've been busy.

1994
01:59:12,125 --> 01:59:13,625
I did it for you.

1995
01:59:15,667 --> 01:59:17,958
And even if you don't want me,
I did it for you.

1996
01:59:27,375 --> 01:59:28,375
<i>It turns out...</i>

1997
01:59:29,083 --> 01:59:30,458
<i>I am the world-saving type.</i>

1998
01:59:31,417 --> 01:59:33,417
<i>Just look around this table
if you want proof.</i>

1999
01:59:34,417 --> 01:59:35,375
<i>And the best part?</i>

2000
01:59:36,333 --> 01:59:38,083
<i>Sometimes the people we save...</i>

2001
01:59:39,125 --> 01:59:41,292
<i>well, they save us right back.</i>

2002
02:00:20,750 --> 02:00:22,875
<i>You're not the only one with gifts.</i>

2003
02:00:23,042 --> 02:00:24,208
What is this place?

2004
02:00:53,208 --> 02:00:54,042
Nice suit.

2005
02:00:54,208 --> 02:00:55,083
Zip it, Stan Lee.

2006
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,542
{\an8}I really like the,
the art in the Deadpool comics.

2007
02:01:06,708 --> 02:01:08,958
<i>You know, I just always felt a
kind of a kinship to him.</i>

2008
02:01:09,125 --> 02:01:11,833
And I just thought,
I'd like to play that guy someday.

2009
02:01:40,625 --> 02:01:43,125
I was there for three weeks
before I shot a single thing.

2010
02:01:43,542 --> 02:01:45,083
{\an8}At our first day of shooting...

2011
02:01:45,625 --> 02:01:47,125
<i>I was so nervous, man.</i>

2012
02:01:47,708 --> 02:01:49,792
Everyone was sort of going,
"Who's this guy?"

2013
02:01:49,958 --> 02:01:51,792
<i>You know, there was a lot of that and...</i>

2014
02:01:51,958 --> 02:01:55,417
you know, "Is he gonna deliver or not?"
You can feel all that kind of pressure.

2015
02:01:56,750 --> 02:02:00,000
It's always the suit's fault.
Never the actor.

2016
02:02:08,792 --> 02:02:10,167
- This is...
- The only way.

2017
02:02:19,583 --> 02:02:21,500
So this is what it feels like.

2018
02:02:24,042 --> 02:02:25,667
And there's the lights.

2019
02:02:25,833 --> 02:02:27,083
For medical research.

2020
02:02:27,708 --> 02:02:29,625
- Bye-bye, video.
- Bye.

2021
02:06:43,417 --> 02:06:47,292
I'm tired of these absolutely vile rumors
that I got Johnny killed.

2022
02:06:48,375 --> 02:06:49,417
Let's look at the tape.

2023
02:06:50,625 --> 02:06:51,833
<i>In The Void...</i>

2024
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,792
<i>you're either food for Alioth...</i>

2025
02:06:53,958 --> 02:06:55,083
or you work for her.

2026
02:06:58,250 --> 02:06:59,167
Go on, Johnny.

2027
02:06:59,708 --> 02:07:00,833
And I'll tell you who "her" is.

2028
02:07:01,333 --> 02:07:02,208
Cassandra Nova.

2029
02:07:02,375 --> 02:07:04,542
A megalomaniacal, psychotic asshole.

2030
02:07:04,708 --> 02:07:08,417
A finger licking dead-inside pixie slab of
third rate dime-store nut-milk.

2031
02:07:08,583 --> 02:07:10,125
- And I'll tell you what she can do.
- I'm listening.

2032
02:07:10,292 --> 02:07:13,833
She can lick my goddamn cinnamon ring clean
and kick rocks all the way to bald hell.

2033
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,208
In fact, I don't give a shit if she removes
all my skin and...

2034
02:07:16,375 --> 02:07:18,250
pops me like some nightmarish blood balloon.

2035
02:07:18,417 --> 02:07:21,375
If the last thing I do in this godforsaken
cum-gutter existence...

2036
02:07:21,542 --> 02:07:24,292
is light that fuck-box on fire,
I still won't die happy.

2037
02:07:24,458 --> 02:07:26,208
Holy shit, girl. You crazy.

2038
02:07:26,375 --> 02:07:28,000
That's right, Wade.
I won't be happy until...

2039
02:07:28,167 --> 02:07:31,917
I've urinated on her freshly barbecued corpse
and husk-fucked the charred remains...

2040
02:07:32,083 --> 02:07:33,833
while gargling Juggernaut's juggernuts.

2041
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:35,375
- Wow!
- And you can quote me.

2042
02:07:35,542 --> 02:07:36,375
'Kay.

2043
02:07:37,125 --> 02:07:38,417
Got you, fuckface.
