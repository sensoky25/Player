1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000


2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000


3
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:42,854
...salute you.

4
00:03:58,532 --> 00:03:59,950
Be gentle, Hanno.

5
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:28,246
We invoke you by your great names
to come to our aid.

6
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,998
Defeat the Romans.

7
00:05:30,081 --> 00:05:31,666
Destroy their ships,

8
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,376
their engines of war,

9
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,337
and their soldiers.

10
00:05:36,338 --> 00:05:38,340
We will prevail.

11
00:05:43,386 --> 00:05:44,638
Ozalsces.

12
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:49,518
Arishat.

13
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:04,950
Hanno.

14
00:06:08,995 --> 00:06:11,414
You did not make an offering today.

15
00:06:11,498 --> 00:06:13,917
I prefer to sacrifice a Roman.

16
00:06:29,683 --> 00:06:31,017
Where you are,

17
00:06:32,143 --> 00:06:33,144
I am, too.

18
00:06:37,524 --> 00:06:39,234
And where you are,

19
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:41,861
I am, too, forever.

20
00:06:41,945 --> 00:06:43,321
My wife.

21
00:07:19,065 --> 00:07:21,735
The wind is too strong.
Furl sail and strike water.

22
00:07:21,818 --> 00:07:24,154
Furl sail, strike water!

23
00:07:24,237 --> 00:07:26,698
Furl sail and strike water!

24
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:36,541
Strike water!

25
00:08:03,902 --> 00:08:06,905
They have no lands
but the ones they've stolen.

26
00:08:06,988 --> 00:08:11,368
Wherever they go,
they leave destruction and call it peace.

27
00:08:13,328 --> 00:08:16,039
This is the last free city in Africa Nova.

28
00:08:17,707 --> 00:08:20,251
Today, we go into battle.

29
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:26,257
Pray that your god is with you.
If he is not, he is no god.

30
00:08:29,803 --> 00:08:31,596
We've nothing to fear.

31
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,515
Where death is, we are not.

32
00:08:34,474 --> 00:08:35,934
Where we are,

33
00:08:37,602 --> 00:08:38,770
death is not.

34
00:08:41,773 --> 00:08:44,609
Stay together and listen for my commands.

35
00:08:47,654 --> 00:08:49,406
Your eyes up and your head out.

36
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,860
Fire!

37
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:35,160
Ready your weapons!

38
00:09:35,243 --> 00:09:36,327
Again!

39
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:44,252
We're ablaze on the right!

40
00:09:45,587 --> 00:09:47,338
Keep formation!

41
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:52,093
Pull!

42
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,727
Archers ready.

43
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,312
Release!

44
00:10:09,527 --> 00:10:10,653
Nock!

45
00:10:10,737 --> 00:10:12,530
Draw!

46
00:10:13,156 --> 00:10:14,324
Loose!

47
00:10:21,456 --> 00:10:22,540
Archers!

48
00:10:30,715 --> 00:10:32,300
Fire!

49
00:10:43,853 --> 00:10:46,815
- Raise the tower!
- Raise the tower!

50
00:11:02,872 --> 00:11:05,291
- Back astern!
- Back astern!

51
00:11:12,882 --> 00:11:14,175
Keep cranking.

52
00:11:24,227 --> 00:11:25,979
Drop drawbridge!

53
00:11:26,062 --> 00:11:27,647
The drawbridge is stuck!

54
00:11:37,282 --> 00:11:38,616
Sir!

55
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,287
Loose!

56
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,633
Back.

57
00:12:58,446 --> 00:12:59,906
Archers!

58
00:12:59,989 --> 00:13:01,115
There!

59
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:02,450
Kill her!

60
00:13:03,368 --> 00:13:04,702
Arishat!

61
00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:16,649
Arishat.

62
00:14:28,036 --> 00:14:32,123
Arishat!

63
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:41,215
I'll wait for you.

64
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,135
Check all the bodies!

65
00:15:26,886 --> 00:15:28,096
Leave nothing!

66
00:17:16,913 --> 00:17:18,581
I claim this city...

67
00:17:21,417 --> 00:17:23,294
for the glory of Rome.

68
00:17:25,213 --> 00:17:26,881
<i>Vae victis.</i>

69
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,385
Woe to the conquered.

70
00:17:50,613 --> 00:17:51,614
Next!

71
00:17:54,367 --> 00:17:55,368
Move it!

72
00:18:11,676 --> 00:18:14,303
- Down the stairs!
- Downstairs!

73
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:03,894
Hey.

74
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:06,814
What damage have they done you, eh?

75
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:21,662
Lift it up. Easy, easy.

76
00:19:21,746 --> 00:19:22,747
Hold that.

77
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,213
Arishat?

78
00:19:34,592 --> 00:19:35,926
I am sorry, my son.

79
00:19:39,889 --> 00:19:41,098
I have not long.

80
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:44,560
This galley

81
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:47,021
is sailing us to something
I cannot endure.

82
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:50,232
I am ready... to be taken to another place.

83
00:19:50,316 --> 00:19:52,443
Stay here a while longer.

84
00:19:56,322 --> 00:19:59,950
I remember well when you first
were brought to us.

85
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:03,621
A lonely boy from the desert. Guileless.

86
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:04,914
Afraid.

87
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:09,126
You embraced everything we taught you.

88
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:15,508
You found Arishat's love.
Your soul was replenished.

89
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:20,096
When I die,

90
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:22,973
my ancestors will meet me
in the next world.

91
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:26,435
Who will meet you?

92
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:28,771
Hanno,

93
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:30,731
I am done.

94
00:20:30,815 --> 00:20:34,068
Do not let them change what you are.

95
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:06,934
Have you seen this boy?

96
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:14,442
Eama! Eama!

97
00:21:19,864 --> 00:21:22,241
You must go alone now, Hanno.

98
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:27,830
Never let them find you.

99
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:34,420
Go. Go.

100
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:30,786
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

101
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:32,079
Emperor Geta.

102
00:23:34,415 --> 00:23:36,041
Emperor Caracalla.

103
00:23:37,668 --> 00:23:39,295
General Acacius.

104
00:23:39,378 --> 00:23:41,797
I have taken Numidia in your names

105
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:46,594
that your dominion may eclipse that
of every emperor that came before you.

106
00:23:46,677 --> 00:23:48,512
Crown him with laurels, brother.

107
00:23:58,063 --> 00:24:01,191
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

108
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:08,699
In honor of your conquest,

109
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,785
there will be games in the Colosseum.

110
00:24:13,037 --> 00:24:14,788
I require no games in my honor.

111
00:24:15,706 --> 00:24:19,293
Serving the Senate and the people of Rome

112
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:21,086
is honor enough for me.

113
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:23,255
You are too modest, Acacius.

114
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:27,134
It does not suit a general
as accomplished as yourself.

115
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:31,055
The glory is yours, not mine.

116
00:24:32,306 --> 00:24:34,558
I only ask for some respite from war

117
00:24:35,517 --> 00:24:37,019
to spend time with my wife.

118
00:24:37,102 --> 00:24:39,521
Your wife, yes.

119
00:24:39,605 --> 00:24:41,315
Remember the privileges
we have granted her?

120
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:44,943
Where is she now
to ignore such an occasion?

121
00:24:45,027 --> 00:24:46,904
There are victories yet still to come.

122
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:50,866
Persia.

123
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:53,243
India.

124
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:57,998
Both... must be conquered.

125
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:01,919
Rome has so many subjects.

126
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:04,463
She must feed them.

127
00:25:05,756 --> 00:25:07,966
They can eat war.

128
00:25:10,886 --> 00:25:13,972
Your triumphs will be celebrated

129
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:17,226
as a tribute to the greatness

130
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:19,311
of the Roman people.

131
00:25:41,709 --> 00:25:42,793
Go to hell!

132
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,399
Macrinus of Thysdrus,

133
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:07,693
master of gladiators!

134
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:32,092
Stay close.

135
00:26:48,442 --> 00:26:52,196
Aediles
and the town councilors,

136
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:55,491
distinguished guests,

137
00:26:56,617 --> 00:26:58,577
citizens of Antium...

138
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:04,541
...behold the fate

139
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:08,504
of the conquered enemies of Rome:

140
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:14,635
The barbarian Numidians
and their chieftain,

141
00:27:15,469 --> 00:27:18,388
Jugurtha!

142
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:39,970
This one is interesting.

143
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:08,206
I'll buy him.

144
00:29:29,144 --> 00:29:32,356
Halt! Who goes there?

145
00:29:33,941 --> 00:29:35,150
General.

146
00:30:10,686 --> 00:30:12,229
My lady.

147
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:22,864
I thank the gods
that brought you back home safe.

148
00:30:23,615 --> 00:30:25,993
Thank the Army. They protected me.

149
00:30:27,786 --> 00:30:28,912
Mm.

150
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:31,623
Let me feed you.

151
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:00,360
Go.

152
00:31:01,111 --> 00:31:02,446
To the wall.

153
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,125
The arena is a sacred temple.

154
00:31:15,751 --> 00:31:17,377
For the bravest of you,

155
00:31:17,461 --> 00:31:19,671
the road to glory runs through the arena.

156
00:31:20,422 --> 00:31:24,384
The arena turns slaves into gladiators
and gladiators into free men.

157
00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:33,226
You have worms.

158
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:40,609
I know this one. He eats monkeys.

159
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:57,042
Go. Sit. Eat.

160
00:32:57,727 --> 00:32:58,728
You.

161
00:33:00,188 --> 00:33:01,690
Hanno, get up.

162
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:12,576
What is your native language?
I speak them all.

163
00:33:16,204 --> 00:33:19,374
You don't answer
because you can't or because you won't?

164
00:33:21,585 --> 00:33:22,752
Mm, all right.

165
00:33:23,336 --> 00:33:26,673
Violence... is the universal language.

166
00:33:26,756 --> 00:33:29,426
Viggo, put him through his paces.

167
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:33,346
He can fight an ape.
Let's see if he can fight a man.

168
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,334
Enough!

169
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:50,048
Very good.

170
00:34:51,591 --> 00:34:52,926
Very good.

171
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:56,346
Hose him down.

172
00:35:00,183 --> 00:35:01,559
Bring him to me.

173
00:35:08,608 --> 00:35:09,859
Ah!

174
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:14,531
A strong jaw.

175
00:35:16,366 --> 00:35:17,826
Good arms.

176
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:20,662
Better smell.

177
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:25,208
You will do well.

178
00:35:26,042 --> 00:35:27,252
It is an art,

179
00:35:28,003 --> 00:35:29,796
choosing gladiators.

180
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:32,924
Some choose entertainers.

181
00:35:33,633 --> 00:35:35,719
Some choose brute force.

182
00:35:35,802 --> 00:35:37,262
I choose rage.

183
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:42,767
Crowd loves blood.

184
00:35:42,851 --> 00:35:45,145
And they love those who love blood
as much as they do.

185
00:35:45,228 --> 00:35:47,605
And you, my friend, rage

186
00:35:48,398 --> 00:35:50,567
pours out of you like...

187
00:35:52,068 --> 00:35:53,570
like milk...

188
00:35:55,238 --> 00:35:56,531
from a whore's tit.

189
00:35:57,574 --> 00:35:59,326
You will be quite the fighter.

190
00:35:59,409 --> 00:36:00,410
Not for you.

191
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:03,121
You're right, you do not fight for me.

192
00:36:03,913 --> 00:36:05,582
I put you in the ring,
you fight or you die.

193
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:06,833
The choice is yours.

194
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:09,127
But whose head could I give you

195
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:13,590
that would satisfy this fury?

196
00:36:13,673 --> 00:36:15,592
The entire Roman Army's.

197
00:36:19,095 --> 00:36:20,221
Too much.

198
00:36:20,305 --> 00:36:21,931
Mm.

199
00:36:22,015 --> 00:36:24,100
The general will do.

200
00:36:24,184 --> 00:36:25,060
General?

201
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:28,438
- General Acacius?
- Mm.

202
00:36:30,815 --> 00:36:33,360
Use your rage in my service,

203
00:36:33,443 --> 00:36:37,238
and you will have his head
ready for your sword.

204
00:36:38,531 --> 00:36:41,534
Serve me and I will serve you. Deny me...

205
00:36:42,952 --> 00:36:45,497
and you will die.

206
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:50,251
There are times I wished
you'd abandoned me

207
00:36:50,335 --> 00:36:52,087
rather than fight their wars.

208
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:54,130
I've made my choice.

209
00:36:56,216 --> 00:36:58,051
I can live with it.

210
00:37:02,222 --> 00:37:05,100
But my patience with those two
is at an end.

211
00:37:07,977 --> 00:37:09,229
Leta?

212
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:13,691
You may go to your quarters now.
We need nothing more.

213
00:37:20,907 --> 00:37:22,534
To hear wives and mothers
mourning their dead

214
00:37:22,617 --> 00:37:24,285
on that beach at Numidia...

215
00:37:26,871 --> 00:37:28,456
Lucilla.

216
00:37:33,628 --> 00:37:35,046
No more.

217
00:37:37,507 --> 00:37:38,842
I will not waste

218
00:37:39,676 --> 00:37:43,179
another generation
of young men for their vanity.

219
00:37:45,432 --> 00:37:48,935
If I fight another campaign,
it must be to depose them.

220
00:37:50,895 --> 00:37:52,939
When will your troops arrive?

221
00:37:53,815 --> 00:37:56,151
They land at Ostia in ten days.

222
00:37:56,234 --> 00:37:59,446
How many of them
will be loyal to you alone?

223
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:03,199
All of them.

224
00:38:05,326 --> 00:38:08,163
The emperors do not have
the support of the people.

225
00:38:09,038 --> 00:38:13,460
The people are weary
of the madness, the tyranny.

226
00:38:16,546 --> 00:38:20,842
What is the dream of Rome
if her people are not free?

227
00:38:43,323 --> 00:38:45,158
Enjoy yourself, everyone,

228
00:38:45,909 --> 00:38:47,327
to excess!

229
00:38:47,952 --> 00:38:49,954
Thank you. Thank you.

230
00:39:02,884 --> 00:39:04,135
Oh!

231
00:39:04,886 --> 00:39:07,972
Please, drink.

232
00:39:08,056 --> 00:39:10,892
Ah! Excuse me. Macrinus!

233
00:39:12,227 --> 00:39:14,896
I knew the provinces
were not enough for you.

234
00:39:14,979 --> 00:39:18,149
- I'm just here for the games.
- Ah, well,

235
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:19,859
you won't be disappointed.

236
00:39:19,943 --> 00:39:23,154
Rome has all the games
that men like you like to play.

237
00:39:23,238 --> 00:39:25,490
Men like me, Thraex? Men like us.

238
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:29,410
I know nothing happens
in Rome unless you've tasted it first.

239
00:39:45,677 --> 00:39:47,220
What is my purpose here?

240
00:39:47,303 --> 00:39:48,680
You'll find out soon enough.

241
00:39:53,351 --> 00:39:55,520
What's this we hear
about you being interested

242
00:39:55,603 --> 00:39:59,357
in standing for election
to the Senate, Macrinus?

243
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,943
Me? No, I'm, uh...

244
00:40:02,026 --> 00:40:04,696
I don't even know how to use an abacus.

245
00:40:04,779 --> 00:40:06,281
But I do understand that

246
00:40:07,532 --> 00:40:11,619
it's customary for your guests
to make wagers at these affairs?

247
00:40:11,703 --> 00:40:13,871
How large a sum did you have in mind?

248
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,041
A thousand gold denarii?

249
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:18,376
Two.

250
00:40:20,378 --> 00:40:21,546
Two?

251
00:40:23,548 --> 00:40:25,758
Denarii.

252
00:40:41,733 --> 00:40:44,402
Stand back! Stand back!

253
00:40:46,154 --> 00:40:47,572
My emperors.

254
00:40:47,655 --> 00:40:51,743
Lords, ladies and gentlemen, and senators.

255
00:40:51,826 --> 00:40:54,078
For your entertainment,

256
00:40:54,829 --> 00:40:57,165
the art of combat!

257
00:40:59,292 --> 00:41:01,002
May I present

258
00:41:01,085 --> 00:41:03,921
the barbarian versus,

259
00:41:04,005 --> 00:41:07,425
from my own stable, the mighty Vichek!

260
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:17,185
- This is your gladiator?
- It is.

261
00:41:20,688 --> 00:41:23,274
Three rounds, hand to hand.

262
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:24,525
Swords!

263
00:41:25,276 --> 00:41:28,279
We want swords. A fight to the death.

264
00:41:29,656 --> 00:41:32,659
No quarter to be offered... or given.

265
00:41:32,742 --> 00:41:34,786
Fight now!

266
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:41,376
Brother,

267
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:44,337
let's not kill each other
for their amusement.

268
00:42:50,611 --> 00:42:52,155
Remarkable!

269
00:42:54,699 --> 00:42:56,200
Remarkable!

270
00:42:57,452 --> 00:42:59,412
Thraex, he looked expensive.

271
00:43:00,788 --> 00:43:02,957
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

272
00:43:03,958 --> 00:43:05,293
Remarkable.

273
00:43:09,881 --> 00:43:11,382
From where do you hail?

274
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,389
Speak.

275
00:43:22,101 --> 00:43:25,104
- I said speak.
- He is from the colonies, Your Majesty.

276
00:43:25,188 --> 00:43:27,482
His native tongue is all he understands.

277
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:36,991
"The gates of hell are open night and day.

278
00:43:38,576 --> 00:43:43,581
Smooth is the descent,
and easy is the way.

279
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:48,669
But...

280
00:43:50,463 --> 00:43:52,256
to come back from hell

281
00:43:53,007 --> 00:43:54,842
and view the cheerful skies,

282
00:43:54,926 --> 00:43:59,430
in this the task and mighty labor lies."

283
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:07,313
Virgil, Your Majesty.

284
00:44:08,481 --> 00:44:09,482
Poetry!

285
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:15,446
- Very clever, Macrinus.
- Thank you.

286
00:44:16,781 --> 00:44:19,116
I've grown so bored, but you surprise me.

287
00:44:19,909 --> 00:44:22,245
To amuse you is my only wish.

288
00:44:22,328 --> 00:44:24,080
We are amused, we are amused.

289
00:44:26,165 --> 00:44:27,416
We are amused.

290
00:44:28,876 --> 00:44:31,712
And we all look forward
to seeing your poet

291
00:44:33,089 --> 00:44:34,423
perform in the arena.

292
00:44:34,507 --> 00:44:37,385
As do I, Your Majesties.

293
00:44:38,219 --> 00:44:39,220
Thank you.

294
00:44:39,887 --> 00:44:40,721
Viggo?

295
00:44:42,181 --> 00:44:43,516
Come with me.

296
00:45:01,701 --> 00:45:04,120
You fought well today,
but you were lucky, too.

297
00:45:06,581 --> 00:45:08,416
The lines you recited.

298
00:45:09,125 --> 00:45:11,627
You didn't learn that
in Africa, I know that.

299
00:45:12,587 --> 00:45:14,797
- A good verse travels far.
- Mm.

300
00:45:14,881 --> 00:45:16,841
Who taught you poetry?

301
00:45:16,924 --> 00:45:19,093
A captured Roman officer.

302
00:45:19,802 --> 00:45:22,763
I was posted guard over him
and he used to tell us tales

303
00:45:22,847 --> 00:45:24,348
to pass the time.

304
00:45:25,349 --> 00:45:26,601
And what became of this prisoner?

305
00:45:26,684 --> 00:45:28,102
Oh, we ate him.

306
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,563
As barbarians do.

307
00:45:30,646 --> 00:45:33,024
As barbarians do.

308
00:45:33,107 --> 00:45:34,317
And where were you born?

309
00:45:35,192 --> 00:45:39,697
Why does my past matter if it is my future
to die for you in the arena?

310
00:45:46,495 --> 00:45:48,581
Tell me what use have I for Roman money.

311
00:45:51,876 --> 00:45:53,377
A gladiator

312
00:45:54,295 --> 00:45:57,048
- can buy his own freedom.
- Mmm.

313
00:45:57,131 --> 00:45:58,925
His liberty.

314
00:45:59,884 --> 00:46:01,636
The Roman dream.

315
00:46:01,719 --> 00:46:05,932
No, the slave dreams not of freedom
but of a slave to call his own.

316
00:46:07,141 --> 00:46:08,559
Cicero.

317
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:12,146
Is that what you were raised on, Macrinus?

318
00:46:13,898 --> 00:46:16,400
What did you have to do for Roman money?

319
00:46:17,276 --> 00:46:19,278
You promised me a head.

320
00:46:19,362 --> 00:46:22,156
Earn your keep
and you can have anyone's head.

321
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:47,640
Father,

322
00:46:48,849 --> 00:46:50,768
protect us and guide us.

323
00:47:04,699 --> 00:47:06,033
Senators.

324
00:47:06,701 --> 00:47:07,868
My lady.

325
00:47:13,958 --> 00:47:17,461
My lady, I wish we were
meeting in better times.

326
00:47:18,295 --> 00:47:20,297
Better times will come.

327
00:47:21,632 --> 00:47:24,010
And why are we here?

328
00:47:24,093 --> 00:47:25,928
To take back the city.

329
00:47:27,805 --> 00:47:31,350
And restore Rome to where she should be.

330
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:34,687
An exciting venture.

331
00:47:35,938 --> 00:47:38,357
- When?
- On the final day of the games.

332
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:41,360
My army waits for my command at Ostia.

333
00:47:42,236 --> 00:47:44,905
Five thousand soldiers loyal to me...

334
00:47:46,449 --> 00:47:48,951
will enter Rome and then the Colosseum,

335
00:47:49,035 --> 00:47:52,496
where they will arrest the emperors
for their crimes against the Senate

336
00:47:53,414 --> 00:47:54,915
and their people.

337
00:47:55,916 --> 00:48:00,212
Uh, this plan is ambitious and risky.

338
00:48:01,005 --> 00:48:03,758
Rome will be yours to administer and to--

339
00:48:03,841 --> 00:48:08,512
Marcus Aurelius talked
of restoring power to the Senate,

340
00:48:08,596 --> 00:48:12,058
but that was a generation ago.
Much has changed.

341
00:48:13,017 --> 00:48:15,978
The people have not seen hope

342
00:48:17,021 --> 00:48:18,397
for many years.

343
00:48:18,481 --> 00:48:22,151
But with time... and guidance...

344
00:48:22,234 --> 00:48:27,198
Lucilla,
you are the daughter of Marcus Aurelius.

345
00:48:27,281 --> 00:48:29,283
He had my loyalty.

346
00:48:31,077 --> 00:48:32,995
And so do you.

347
00:48:35,331 --> 00:48:36,749
Senator Thraex?

348
00:48:38,542 --> 00:48:41,879
Politics follows power, my lady.

349
00:48:43,047 --> 00:48:46,050
Take back what is rightfully yours...

350
00:48:47,093 --> 00:48:49,095
and the Senate will support you.

351
00:48:50,221 --> 00:48:51,388
Thank you.

352
00:49:07,571 --> 00:49:08,906
Food! Food!

353
00:49:13,577 --> 00:49:15,204
When I was told of this place,

354
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:18,207
they never mentioned the stink.

355
00:49:19,708 --> 00:49:21,418
That would be Hanno.

356
00:49:24,755 --> 00:49:27,591
Well, you'll have to
put up with me as I am.

357
00:49:32,763 --> 00:49:35,808
And what's that up there? A wolf?

358
00:49:37,601 --> 00:49:40,020
The twins there, they were outcasts.

359
00:49:40,938 --> 00:49:42,606
Left in the hills to die.

360
00:49:44,108 --> 00:49:47,695
That wolf found them
and she suckled them on her milk.

361
00:49:49,029 --> 00:49:51,365
Raised by an animal. It's in their blood.

362
00:49:51,448 --> 00:49:53,450
How do you know this place?

363
00:49:55,452 --> 00:49:57,454
I know the chaos they brought.

364
00:49:58,706 --> 00:50:01,500
This city infects everything it touches.

365
00:50:01,584 --> 00:50:03,669
I never dreamt it would be so big.

366
00:50:03,752 --> 00:50:05,504
Don't fall for it.

367
00:50:05,588 --> 00:50:07,548
This city is diseased.

368
00:50:08,924 --> 00:50:11,010
Food! Food!

369
00:50:34,783 --> 00:50:37,203
You! Barbarian scum!

370
00:50:43,167 --> 00:50:45,127
Help me. Please, help me!

371
00:51:21,956 --> 00:51:23,165
- Ah!
- Thraex.

372
00:51:27,044 --> 00:51:28,087
About our wager.

373
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:29,922
Ah. The barbarian.

374
00:51:30,005 --> 00:51:31,924
Yes, I haven't forgotten,
I always repay my debts.

375
00:51:32,007 --> 00:51:35,344
I was merely going to suggest
that perhaps your luck might change.

376
00:51:35,427 --> 00:51:37,763
Shall we say double or quits?

377
00:51:42,351 --> 00:51:43,519
- Ah.
- Ah.

378
00:51:55,823 --> 00:51:57,157
Get back!

379
00:52:11,463 --> 00:52:12,965
Fresh meat.

380
00:52:17,052 --> 00:52:18,887
Line up! Line up!

381
00:52:50,169 --> 00:52:52,087
Play! Play!

382
00:53:07,353 --> 00:53:09,605
Emperor Caracalla.

383
00:53:10,356 --> 00:53:11,774
Emperor Geta.

384
00:53:12,358 --> 00:53:15,194
Citizens of Rome!

385
00:53:16,945 --> 00:53:19,990
These sacred games

386
00:53:20,074 --> 00:53:23,327
are held to honor the victory of Rome

387
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:26,497
over the barbarians of Numidia.

388
00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:30,292
Go! Go!

389
00:53:33,212 --> 00:53:36,715
And to honor
Rome's legionary commander,

390
00:53:36,799 --> 00:53:39,009
General Justus Acacius!

391
00:53:39,093 --> 00:53:41,762
Long live Acacius!

392
00:53:41,845 --> 00:53:43,222
And with him

393
00:53:43,305 --> 00:53:48,102
Lucilla, the daughter
of Emperor Marcus Aurelius.

394
00:53:49,895 --> 00:53:53,357
- Lucilla!
- Mother of Rome!

395
00:53:54,358 --> 00:53:55,651
Acacius.

396
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,361
General.

397
00:54:05,077 --> 00:54:08,414
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

398
00:54:08,497 --> 00:54:13,502
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

399
00:54:14,503 --> 00:54:15,546
Speak to them.

400
00:54:15,629 --> 00:54:17,673
Speak to us!

401
00:54:26,306 --> 00:54:27,975
I am not an orator

402
00:54:29,184 --> 00:54:30,686
or a politician.

403
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:33,605
I am a soldier.

404
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:40,821
I have seen bravery
in men and women during war.

405
00:54:42,072 --> 00:54:43,824
And even once in this arena.

406
00:54:45,409 --> 00:54:47,077
So if you ask anything of the gods...

407
00:54:49,037 --> 00:54:51,373
ask for that same bravery.

408
00:54:53,709 --> 00:54:55,794
Because Rome needs it now.

409
00:54:59,965 --> 00:55:02,801
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

410
00:55:02,885 --> 00:55:06,054
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

411
00:55:18,734 --> 00:55:21,236
From the South Gate,

412
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:26,325
fighters from the stable
of Macrinus of Thysdrus!

413
00:55:38,921 --> 00:55:40,923
From the stables

414
00:55:41,006 --> 00:55:44,593
of Emperors Caracalla and Geta themselves,

415
00:55:44,676 --> 00:55:47,262
the undefeated champion:

416
00:55:47,346 --> 00:55:51,016
Glyceo the Destroyer!

417
00:55:57,606 --> 00:55:58,565
Hold.

418
00:56:21,421 --> 00:56:23,215
Hold.

419
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:26,134
Hail Caesars!

420
00:56:27,803 --> 00:56:31,223
Glyceo! Glyceo! Glyceo!

421
00:56:42,859 --> 00:56:46,071
Hold together and when it charges,
break for the wall.

422
00:56:46,154 --> 00:56:46,989
Why should I?

423
00:56:51,285 --> 00:56:52,119
Hold!

424
00:56:53,328 --> 00:56:54,454
Hold!

425
00:56:54,538 --> 00:56:55,747
Break!

426
00:56:56,498 --> 00:56:57,749
Cowards!

427
00:57:11,847 --> 00:57:13,890
To the wall!

428
00:57:25,944 --> 00:57:28,196
Come on!

429
00:59:09,965 --> 00:59:13,135
Brother, it's that poet, is it not?

430
00:59:13,969 --> 00:59:15,971
I can't remember.

431
00:59:16,054 --> 00:59:17,723
That night was a blur.

432
00:59:19,141 --> 00:59:21,810
"The gates of hell are open night and day.

433
00:59:21,893 --> 00:59:24,980
Smooth the desc--" I forget.

434
00:59:25,063 --> 00:59:26,815
"Smooth the descent..."

435
00:59:27,649 --> 00:59:29,651
"Smooth is the descent,

436
00:59:30,235 --> 00:59:31,903
easy is the way."

437
00:59:39,661 --> 00:59:40,662
Shield!

438
01:00:16,865 --> 01:00:20,327
Mercy! Mercy! Mercy!

439
01:00:22,204 --> 01:00:23,371
Blood.

440
01:00:26,458 --> 01:00:27,542
Lucilla,

441
01:00:28,251 --> 01:00:29,586
shall we show mercy?

442
01:00:29,669 --> 01:00:31,254
Mercy.

443
01:00:46,645 --> 01:00:48,063
No mercy!

444
01:00:48,730 --> 01:00:50,607
Your life has been spared by the gods--

445
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:54,694
I would sooner face your blade
than accept Roman mercy!

446
01:01:10,836 --> 01:01:14,256
Kill! Kill! Kill!

447
01:01:14,339 --> 01:01:17,467
Kill! Kill! Kill!

448
01:01:28,979 --> 01:01:33,942
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

449
01:02:02,053 --> 01:02:04,723
The road to freedom
doesn't run through the arena.

450
01:02:05,557 --> 01:02:07,058
It leads to this.

451
01:02:11,605 --> 01:02:13,023
Go to your cells.

452
01:02:17,402 --> 01:02:20,906
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

453
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:39,174
Come on, let's go.

454
01:02:52,437 --> 01:02:55,649
"Gates of hell are open night and day.

455
01:02:56,691 --> 01:02:58,360
Smooth is the descent...

456
01:02:58,443 --> 01:03:00,320
...easy is the way."

457
01:03:04,449 --> 01:03:06,868
<i>There, there, there, there.</i>

458
01:03:06,952 --> 01:03:08,203
<i>And I've got you.</i>

459
01:03:08,286 --> 01:03:10,956
<i>I'm Maximus, the savior of Rome!</i>

460
01:03:30,558 --> 01:03:32,560
Scatto and Argento.

461
01:03:46,324 --> 01:03:47,659
Lucius is safe?

462
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:06,553
Lucius!

463
01:04:19,274 --> 01:04:20,316
Lucius,

464
01:04:21,276 --> 01:04:24,195
you're the sole heir to the throne now.

465
01:04:25,989 --> 01:04:28,825
There are men who want to kill you
so they can take power.

466
01:04:30,535 --> 01:04:33,788
I promise I'll bring you back
as soon as it's safe.

467
01:04:33,872 --> 01:04:36,458
Mother, why can't you come with me?

468
01:04:37,584 --> 01:04:40,045
I... I have to stay here
for your sake.

469
01:04:40,128 --> 01:04:42,130
And for the sake of Rome.

470
01:04:42,213 --> 01:04:43,840
Remember who you are.

471
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,634
And that I love you.

472
01:04:47,385 --> 01:04:48,720
I love you.

473
01:04:49,679 --> 01:04:50,680
Come.

474
01:04:53,975 --> 01:04:55,310
Give me your leg.

475
01:04:57,187 --> 01:04:58,938
Go. Go!

476
01:05:05,612 --> 01:05:07,072
So...

477
01:05:10,408 --> 01:05:11,826
What's your name?

478
01:05:14,662 --> 01:05:17,248
I'm Ravi. I'm a doctor.

479
01:05:18,458 --> 01:05:22,003
Because... more men die of infected wounds

480
01:05:22,087 --> 01:05:24,589
than out there, in the arena.

481
01:05:26,007 --> 01:05:28,885
This needs to be cleaned,
it needs to be stitched and...

482
01:05:28,968 --> 01:05:31,679
...it is going to hurt.

483
01:05:31,763 --> 01:05:32,889
Mm.

484
01:05:32,972 --> 01:05:36,017
This is Devil's Breath and opium.

485
01:05:36,684 --> 01:05:38,186
It's for the pain.

486
01:05:39,187 --> 01:05:40,855
You should breathe in.

487
01:05:46,861 --> 01:05:48,404
I've been here so long now,

488
01:05:48,488 --> 01:05:50,949
I don't even notice anymore.

489
01:05:51,032 --> 01:05:53,743
I've done more amputations
than I can count.

490
01:05:54,953 --> 01:05:57,580
- Where'd you learn your trade?
- Why do you ask?

491
01:05:57,664 --> 01:05:59,290
You've got a heavy hand.

492
01:06:00,708 --> 01:06:02,210
I used to be a gladiator myself.

493
01:06:02,293 --> 01:06:03,461
Ah.

494
01:06:03,545 --> 01:06:05,880
And would you have bested me?

495
01:06:05,964 --> 01:06:07,423
In your prime, of course.

496
01:06:08,633 --> 01:06:11,344
In your current state,
I could best you now.

497
01:06:13,096 --> 01:06:16,349
Luckily for you, I have put down my sword.

498
01:06:16,432 --> 01:06:18,643
So now I spend my days...

499
01:06:18,726 --> 01:06:21,312
...saving lives instead of taking them.

500
01:06:22,814 --> 01:06:25,275
And why such a change so late in life?

501
01:06:26,192 --> 01:06:28,403
What we do in life

502
01:06:28,486 --> 01:06:30,321
echoes in eternity.

503
01:06:34,576 --> 01:06:36,244
I feel like I know those words.

504
01:06:36,327 --> 01:06:38,872
I can't take credit.

505
01:06:38,955 --> 01:06:41,541
It's written on one of the tombs.

506
01:06:41,624 --> 01:06:43,459
Over the bones of a gladiator.

507
01:06:44,377 --> 01:06:45,837
My champion!

508
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:48,006
I smell Devil's Breath!

509
01:06:50,425 --> 01:06:53,761
My... champion.

510
01:06:54,762 --> 01:06:56,472
Did you hear that crowd?

511
01:06:59,517 --> 01:07:01,686
- Did you hear that crowd?
- Mm-hm.

512
01:07:03,229 --> 01:07:05,857
You have something.
I knew it from the start.

513
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:09,777
- Did you now?
- Yes. The Greeks call it...

514
01:07:10,612 --> 01:07:12,155
<i>thymos.</i>

515
01:07:12,238 --> 01:07:13,531
Smoke.

516
01:07:14,282 --> 01:07:15,617
Rage.

517
01:07:16,618 --> 01:07:18,661
That rage is your gift.

518
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:21,206
Like the great Achilles.

519
01:07:22,290 --> 01:07:23,917
Never let it go.

520
01:07:24,709 --> 01:07:27,587
It will carry you to greatness,

521
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:29,422
my champion.

522
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:50,151
Thank you

523
01:07:51,069 --> 01:07:52,237
for inviting me.

524
01:07:53,112 --> 01:07:55,073
This is truly an honor.

525
01:08:00,161 --> 01:08:02,121
I hear you are the talk of the court.

526
01:08:04,415 --> 01:08:05,416
Yes.

527
01:08:06,334 --> 01:08:07,752
We've met before.

528
01:08:08,503 --> 01:08:10,505
- Have we?
- Long ago.

529
01:08:12,006 --> 01:08:13,591
Where?

530
01:08:13,675 --> 01:08:17,303
I was in the service of your father's army
on his African campaign.

531
01:08:18,930 --> 01:08:20,932
You served with my father?

532
01:08:24,686 --> 01:08:25,770
Mm.

533
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:28,523
I had the privilege

534
01:08:29,482 --> 01:08:31,150
of reading his "Meditations."

535
01:08:31,234 --> 01:08:32,443
Mm.

536
01:08:35,446 --> 01:08:37,365
"The best revenge

537
01:08:38,533 --> 01:08:41,744
is to be unlike him
who performed the injury."

538
01:08:44,038 --> 01:08:46,624
I hear you've been arming half the legions

539
01:08:46,708 --> 01:08:51,754
in the entire empire,
and here, now, in Rome...

540
01:08:53,047 --> 01:08:56,009
you're gaining influence
by sponsoring gladiators.

541
01:08:56,092 --> 01:08:58,177
I do it for the love of the sport.

542
01:08:58,261 --> 01:09:01,222
And where did you find these gladiators?

543
01:09:02,223 --> 01:09:04,976
They're usually prisoners of war.

544
01:09:05,935 --> 01:09:08,563
Or vagrants. Why do you ask?

545
01:09:09,522 --> 01:09:12,233
A man can choose to fight...

546
01:09:14,152 --> 01:09:15,153
and stay alive.

547
01:09:15,236 --> 01:09:17,864
It's the same in life as it is
in the arena, is it not?

548
01:09:21,492 --> 01:09:23,161
Who is this?

549
01:09:23,244 --> 01:09:25,580
That is my father as a youth.

550
01:09:28,791 --> 01:09:30,084
<i>She had a child?</i>

551
01:09:30,168 --> 01:09:31,919
Mm.

552
01:09:32,003 --> 01:09:34,422
It's common knowledge.
When Commodus was killed,

553
01:09:34,505 --> 01:09:36,299
- the boy disappeared.
- Mm.

554
01:09:36,382 --> 01:09:38,468
- But who would care?
- Lucilla would care.

555
01:09:38,551 --> 01:09:41,179
- More wine!
- More wine!

556
01:09:42,513 --> 01:09:46,017
He was of the royal bloodline, after all.

557
01:09:47,769 --> 01:09:49,103
And his father?

558
01:09:49,187 --> 01:09:53,107
Ostensibly, Lucius Verus.

559
01:09:54,025 --> 01:09:55,818
See, it was an arranged marriage.

560
01:09:55,902 --> 01:09:56,986
She was 14.

561
01:09:57,070 --> 01:10:00,448
- Mm.
- Females were not his taste.

562
01:10:00,531 --> 01:10:01,908
- Nor mine, some days.
- Nor yours!

563
01:10:03,284 --> 01:10:07,789
No, no, no.
By rumor, you see, she took lovers.

564
01:10:07,872 --> 01:10:12,001
And by rumor,
the real father... was Commodus.

565
01:10:13,002 --> 01:10:15,463
- Brotherly love, you see?
- Yeah.

566
01:10:15,546 --> 01:10:17,215
If he died,

567
01:10:18,216 --> 01:10:20,676
- there has to be remains.
- Mm.

568
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:24,097
And if he lived,
that would make him about...

569
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:26,265
Um, well, let's work it out.

570
01:10:26,349 --> 01:10:29,769
- He was about 12 when he died?
- Yes.

571
01:10:29,852 --> 01:10:34,107
So that would make him...

572
01:11:09,767 --> 01:11:10,601
My lady.

573
01:11:11,227 --> 01:11:12,103
Gracchus.

574
01:11:13,271 --> 01:11:15,106
- Please come.
- Thank you.

575
01:11:33,958 --> 01:11:35,293
Gladiator...

576
01:11:36,836 --> 01:11:37,795
do you know me?

577
01:11:46,262 --> 01:11:47,555
Do you have a family?

578
01:11:50,099 --> 01:11:53,311
A wife. Arishat.

579
01:11:54,896 --> 01:11:56,022
Arishat.

580
01:11:56,105 --> 01:11:59,609
She was killed
under your husband's command.

581
01:12:02,361 --> 01:12:04,530
Rome drowns in its own blood.

582
01:12:04,614 --> 01:12:06,908
And yet you enjoy
the pleasures of the Colosseum.

583
01:12:08,242 --> 01:12:11,078
There is much you do not understand.

584
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:18,920
Lucius.

585
01:12:19,003 --> 01:12:21,214
I do not know who you think I am.

586
01:12:23,549 --> 01:12:25,426
My name is Hanno,

587
01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:27,929
and I have no mother,
or none that I can remember.

588
01:12:34,685 --> 01:12:36,687
I'm so sorry.

589
01:12:36,771 --> 01:12:38,898
If your son were here,
I feel sure he would tell you

590
01:12:38,981 --> 01:12:40,900
not to grieve him.

591
01:12:40,983 --> 01:12:42,735
For he would not be the boy
that you sent away.

592
01:12:42,818 --> 01:12:44,779
That boy is dead.

593
01:12:47,198 --> 01:12:49,283
You may think I have little worth.

594
01:12:50,952 --> 01:12:52,954
You may think I betrayed you.

595
01:12:54,956 --> 01:12:56,707
But I need you to know...

596
01:12:58,125 --> 01:13:01,128
if you will not have your mother's love,

597
01:13:01,212 --> 01:13:04,048
then take your father's strength.

598
01:13:05,299 --> 01:13:06,634
You need it.

599
01:13:08,970 --> 01:13:13,140
His name was Maximus Decimus Meridius.

600
01:13:14,559 --> 01:13:16,060
And I see him in you.

601
01:13:16,143 --> 01:13:17,478
Get out.

602
01:13:19,605 --> 01:13:22,066
My lady, we must go at once!

603
01:13:25,570 --> 01:13:27,196
Lucius, you were loved

604
01:13:28,072 --> 01:13:30,491
by myself and by your father.

605
01:13:32,368 --> 01:13:33,911
Your name was on his lips--

606
01:13:33,995 --> 01:13:35,746
Get out!

607
01:14:01,814 --> 01:14:03,691
Lucius is alive.

608
01:14:06,068 --> 01:14:07,903
Are you certain?

609
01:14:07,987 --> 01:14:09,238
Yes.

610
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:11,532
I know my son.

611
01:14:14,619 --> 01:14:16,454
I spoke to him tonight.

612
01:14:19,874 --> 01:14:22,918
He may be lost to me for what I did,

613
01:14:24,211 --> 01:14:25,880
but he lives.

614
01:14:27,089 --> 01:14:29,717
The third day of the games is tomorrow.

615
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,385
Most fighters won't survive.

616
01:14:31,469 --> 01:14:32,803
Acacius,

617
01:14:34,221 --> 01:14:35,681
you must help him.

618
01:14:36,557 --> 01:14:38,392
- Help him?
- Yes.

619
01:14:40,936 --> 01:14:43,397
I failed him then.

620
01:14:43,981 --> 01:14:45,483
I know I did.

621
01:14:47,318 --> 01:14:49,403
I cannot fail him now.

622
01:14:52,073 --> 01:14:53,532
The army is in Ostia.

623
01:14:53,616 --> 01:14:56,410
If we wait a few days...

624
01:14:56,494 --> 01:14:58,496
He could be dead by then.

625
01:15:00,581 --> 01:15:01,916
Acacius,

626
01:15:01,999 --> 01:15:05,586
I would willingly give my life for Rome,

627
01:15:06,796 --> 01:15:09,173
but I will not give my son's.

628
01:15:15,429 --> 01:15:16,847
And one.

629
01:15:18,516 --> 01:15:19,517
And two.

630
01:15:20,351 --> 01:15:23,104
And one.

631
01:15:23,187 --> 01:15:26,023
Together. Timing, timing, timing!

632
01:15:27,358 --> 01:15:30,361
And one. And two.

633
01:15:31,070 --> 01:15:32,071
And one.

634
01:15:33,114 --> 01:15:34,990
Pause, pause!

635
01:15:37,868 --> 01:15:39,161
We won't get far like this.

636
01:15:40,830 --> 01:15:43,249
Just him. You go.

637
01:15:43,332 --> 01:15:44,333
Go!

638
01:15:45,084 --> 01:15:48,587
Let's see how far you can go
on your own without your team.

639
01:15:50,339 --> 01:15:51,841
Ready?

640
01:15:51,924 --> 01:15:53,134
One!

641
01:15:54,051 --> 01:15:55,010
And two!

642
01:15:55,094 --> 01:15:57,138
Timing, timing!

643
01:15:57,847 --> 01:15:59,223
Come on, more!

644
01:16:04,562 --> 01:16:05,563
More!

645
01:16:22,997 --> 01:16:24,206
Leave him.

646
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:47,188
It's just vinegar, my friend.

647
01:16:48,355 --> 01:16:50,983
There will be no more opium for you.

648
01:16:52,359 --> 01:16:56,030
There is plenty of pain waiting
for you in the next life.

649
01:16:56,113 --> 01:16:59,450
I don't know why
you are so greedy for it in this one.

650
01:17:04,205 --> 01:17:05,664
Are you a free man, Ravi?

651
01:17:05,748 --> 01:17:07,541
"Free."

652
01:17:09,293 --> 01:17:11,670
I am. Mm.

653
01:17:11,754 --> 01:17:13,339
I laid down my sword

654
01:17:13,422 --> 01:17:15,424
and I swore never to pick it up again.

655
01:17:15,508 --> 01:17:17,092
And yet you choose this hell?

656
01:17:17,176 --> 01:17:18,803
Mm-hm.

657
01:17:18,886 --> 01:17:20,179
What was your home before?

658
01:17:21,472 --> 01:17:22,890
Varanasi.

659
01:17:22,973 --> 01:17:24,391
And why don't you go back?

660
01:17:25,351 --> 01:17:26,811
I wish I could.

661
01:17:26,894 --> 01:17:28,562
But... Eh-eh-eh.

662
01:17:31,148 --> 01:17:33,192
- I met a woman.
- Ah.

663
01:17:34,068 --> 01:17:35,903
- It's always a woman.
- Always.

664
01:17:36,570 --> 01:17:40,533
She is from Londinium.
Britannia. You know.

665
01:17:40,616 --> 01:17:42,451
So now...

666
01:17:42,535 --> 01:17:45,496
our sons, they speak only Latin.

667
01:17:45,579 --> 01:17:47,998
My daughter's eyes,
they are as blue as yours.

668
01:17:50,709 --> 01:17:52,002
We are Romans now.

669
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:56,006
I grew up hearing stories
at my grandfather's knee.

670
01:17:57,216 --> 01:18:00,052
He used to talk
of the dream that was Rome.

671
01:18:02,847 --> 01:18:06,767
It was so fragile,
you could only whisper it...

672
01:18:09,103 --> 01:18:10,855
or it would vanish.

673
01:18:11,772 --> 01:18:12,773
So,

674
01:18:13,357 --> 01:18:14,984
what was this dream?

675
01:18:16,151 --> 01:18:19,613
A Rome where all could live
under fair law and be protected.

676
01:18:20,614 --> 01:18:22,449
A Rome of the Senate.

677
01:18:24,118 --> 01:18:25,619
A Rome of hope.

678
01:18:28,747 --> 01:18:33,127
Your grandfather,
he sounds like a dangerous man.

679
01:18:33,210 --> 01:18:34,378
Hm.

680
01:18:37,131 --> 01:18:38,549
The odds are against you.

681
01:18:41,635 --> 01:18:43,637
The odds are always against me.

682
01:18:44,638 --> 01:18:45,848
Don't worry, old man.

683
01:18:45,931 --> 01:18:47,766
Eh?

684
01:18:51,228 --> 01:18:53,355
- You should get some rest. Hm?
- Mm.

685
01:18:54,481 --> 01:18:56,901
Your men will need you
to lead them tomorrow.

686
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:14,960
This is about survival.

687
01:19:16,086 --> 01:19:17,463
Survive!

688
01:19:17,546 --> 01:19:21,342
In the name of Poseidon,

689
01:19:21,425 --> 01:19:25,596
we celebrate the glory of naval war.

690
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:27,431
They have archers.

691
01:19:27,514 --> 01:19:29,975
Be ready. Listen for my commands.

692
01:19:30,059 --> 01:19:32,811
Stay together and pull as one, yes?

693
01:19:32,895 --> 01:19:33,771
Yes!

694
01:19:33,854 --> 01:19:36,148
- Yes?
- Yes!

695
01:19:43,030 --> 01:19:45,783
Today we relive

696
01:19:45,866 --> 01:19:49,411
the Battle of Salamis!

697
01:19:50,621 --> 01:19:55,209
The Trojans versus the Persians!

698
01:19:59,797 --> 01:20:01,340
- Oars out!
- Oars!

699
01:20:02,132 --> 01:20:04,259
And... pull!

700
01:20:23,862 --> 01:20:25,906
Archers!

701
01:20:25,990 --> 01:20:26,865
Archers!

702
01:20:29,034 --> 01:20:30,035
Pull!

703
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:40,713
Pull!

704
01:20:43,465 --> 01:20:44,425
Pull!

705
01:20:57,730 --> 01:21:00,065
Pull! To my time!

706
01:21:00,858 --> 01:21:02,109
And... now!

707
01:21:04,778 --> 01:21:07,156
Left side! Ready, and

708
01:21:07,239 --> 01:21:09,199
ship oars now!

709
01:21:09,283 --> 01:21:11,326
Oars in! Oars in!

710
01:21:12,870 --> 01:21:14,204
Get down!

711
01:21:29,928 --> 01:21:33,891
And pull! And pull!

712
01:21:36,643 --> 01:21:38,854
Don't stop!

713
01:21:41,106 --> 01:21:42,357
Pull!

714
01:21:44,943 --> 01:21:46,320
And right!

715
01:21:51,992 --> 01:21:53,452
Ready to ram!

716
01:21:55,662 --> 01:21:58,207
And brace! Brace!

717
01:22:38,205 --> 01:22:39,581
Everyone regroup!

718
01:23:15,909 --> 01:23:17,870
Praetorians!

719
01:23:19,246 --> 01:23:21,748
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

720
01:23:21,832 --> 01:23:22,791
Move, move.

721
01:23:29,673 --> 01:23:32,885
In the name of the emperors...

722
01:23:32,968 --> 01:23:37,514
the victor is Hanno!

723
01:23:49,776 --> 01:23:51,111
Who did this?

724
01:23:53,906 --> 01:23:56,074
Who did this?!

725
01:23:56,783 --> 01:23:58,410
- It was me!
- I did it!

726
01:23:58,493 --> 01:24:00,913
- I did it! I did it! I did it!
- It was me!

727
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:07,586
Geta will want retribution for all of you.

728
01:24:08,670 --> 01:24:11,506
Did you learn to shoot in the same place
you learned to recite poetry?

729
01:24:11,590 --> 01:24:14,218
Be glad it wasn't me,
or that arrow would have found you.

730
01:24:30,025 --> 01:24:31,443
Be seated.

731
01:24:33,987 --> 01:24:35,364
I have news for you.

732
01:24:39,910 --> 01:24:41,328
He's here, sir.

733
01:24:44,498 --> 01:24:46,458
Oh, still here.

734
01:24:48,669 --> 01:24:50,087
Macrinus.

735
01:24:50,170 --> 01:24:52,256
Welcome.

736
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:55,050
Yes, I'm listening.

737
01:24:56,260 --> 01:24:57,886
You know this is my house now.

738
01:24:58,929 --> 01:25:02,516
Your debt to me is over 10,000 denarii.
You know that.

739
01:25:02,599 --> 01:25:05,435
I have other things. Uh...

740
01:25:05,519 --> 01:25:07,312
Cattle. Art!

741
01:25:07,396 --> 01:25:09,022
Truth, then.

742
01:25:09,106 --> 01:25:10,691
What do you... want?

743
01:25:10,774 --> 01:25:12,776
Truth. That's what I want.

744
01:25:13,527 --> 01:25:17,990
Nothing happens in Rome
without your knowledge.

745
01:25:19,116 --> 01:25:21,118
You have the senators' trust.

746
01:25:21,994 --> 01:25:24,204
You have Lucilla's trust.

747
01:25:24,288 --> 01:25:26,957
More importantly, you have my trust.

748
01:25:29,042 --> 01:25:33,005
You wish my... loyalty?

749
01:25:33,088 --> 01:25:34,715
I own...

750
01:25:36,174 --> 01:25:38,051
your house.

751
01:25:38,135 --> 01:25:40,345
I want your loyalty.

752
01:25:44,516 --> 01:25:45,892
I...

753
01:25:47,144 --> 01:25:48,937
Tell me. I have heard...

754
01:25:49,021 --> 01:25:51,648
of a plot...

755
01:25:52,566 --> 01:25:54,568
- to dethrone the emperors.
- Yes.

756
01:25:55,736 --> 01:25:57,821
But the plan has been delayed, uh...

757
01:25:57,904 --> 01:26:01,074
A gladiator is to be rescued
from the arena.

758
01:26:01,158 --> 01:26:02,576
- Tonight.
- Mm.

759
01:26:02,659 --> 01:26:05,746
- I don't know why.
- I know why. I know who.

760
01:26:08,165 --> 01:26:09,207
Pack.

761
01:26:12,878 --> 01:26:14,379
Quickly.

762
01:26:42,282 --> 01:26:43,492
Open up!

763
01:27:03,553 --> 01:27:05,597
Open for the emperors' guard!

764
01:27:33,083 --> 01:27:36,503
My Lady, come with us.

765
01:28:21,882 --> 01:28:26,803
Thanks to the civic virtue
of men like Thraex and Macrinus,

766
01:28:28,138 --> 01:28:29,806
your insurrection

767
01:28:30,557 --> 01:28:32,476
has been revealed.

768
01:28:34,394 --> 01:28:35,687
The honor,

769
01:28:36,813 --> 01:28:40,609
the dignitas that Rome
has bestowed upon you...

770
01:28:43,153 --> 01:28:45,405
all this you have forfeited
by your treachery.

771
01:28:46,323 --> 01:28:47,616
Please, Emperor Geta.

772
01:28:48,950 --> 01:28:50,785
Torture me if you want,

773
01:28:51,745 --> 01:28:53,121
but do not lecture me.

774
01:28:53,205 --> 01:28:56,625
Your name will be forgotten!

775
01:28:57,751 --> 01:29:00,754
Lost... to history.

776
01:29:02,756 --> 01:29:04,174
You are damned, General.

777
01:29:06,885 --> 01:29:08,803
- You laugh.
- You damn me?

778
01:29:09,971 --> 01:29:11,431
I don't care.

779
01:29:11,515 --> 01:29:15,310
Everything is forgotten in time.
Empires fall. So do emperors.

780
01:29:15,393 --> 01:29:17,103
Why wait?

781
01:29:17,187 --> 01:29:20,398
- I will gut him right now!
- No, no, no!

782
01:29:20,482 --> 01:29:23,109
Let them be. Come! Come!

783
01:29:23,860 --> 01:29:25,695
His death must be public.

784
01:29:25,779 --> 01:29:27,280
Public?

785
01:29:27,364 --> 01:29:30,242
Hang his entrails from the city gates!

786
01:29:30,325 --> 01:29:31,868
And crucify her!

787
01:29:32,619 --> 01:29:34,120
Crucify her!

788
01:29:34,204 --> 01:29:36,122
Take them away!

789
01:29:36,206 --> 01:29:39,543
Shh! Shh! Shh!

790
01:29:52,722 --> 01:29:53,848
Thank you, Macrinus.

791
01:30:00,230 --> 01:30:01,523
Come on.

792
01:30:04,985 --> 01:30:06,861
In these last days,

793
01:30:06,945 --> 01:30:10,198
I have come to think of you
not as a subject

794
01:30:10,282 --> 01:30:12,492
but as a true friend.

795
01:30:12,576 --> 01:30:14,244
Thank you.

796
01:30:14,327 --> 01:30:16,997
Thank you so much. But as a friend,

797
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:18,915
I must counsel caution.

798
01:30:19,916 --> 01:30:21,918
Acacius is a hero of Rome.

799
01:30:23,753 --> 01:30:27,257
Crucifixion is for thieves.

800
01:30:27,340 --> 01:30:28,425
Christians.

801
01:30:29,593 --> 01:30:32,596
- It's too common.
- He is a traitor. He must die.

802
01:30:32,679 --> 01:30:33,930
I agree.

803
01:30:34,014 --> 01:30:39,853
Let the gods decide
his fate in the Colosseum.

804
01:30:46,276 --> 01:30:47,861
Let the gods decide.

805
01:30:50,697 --> 01:30:54,701
You know, last night I woke,
dreaming of a dark river.

806
01:30:56,286 --> 01:30:58,246
This time, for the first time,

807
01:30:58,330 --> 01:30:59,789
I was crossing it.

808
01:31:00,624 --> 01:31:02,292
Hm.

809
01:31:02,375 --> 01:31:04,878
Well, you know, where I come from,

810
01:31:04,961 --> 01:31:07,964
crossing a river,
it represents forgiveness.

811
01:31:08,048 --> 01:31:11,051
Represents... salvation.

812
01:31:11,134 --> 01:31:14,137
Where I come from,
it means you're already dead.

813
01:31:22,479 --> 01:31:24,981
But as I saw it, I was not afraid.

814
01:31:26,733 --> 01:31:28,401
For...

815
01:31:28,485 --> 01:31:31,321
For someone was waiting
for me on the other side.

816
01:31:32,989 --> 01:31:34,699
There.

817
01:31:45,001 --> 01:31:46,503
Who is this man?

818
01:31:47,879 --> 01:31:49,297
Scratched out?

819
01:31:50,256 --> 01:31:52,258
Maximus.

820
01:31:55,053 --> 01:31:57,013
I saw him fight once.

821
01:31:58,098 --> 01:31:59,683
- He was magnificent.
- Mm.

822
01:31:59,766 --> 01:32:02,727
Yeah. My time in the arena,
it was after his,

823
01:32:02,811 --> 01:32:07,107
but many still talked of him
in whispers, you know?

824
01:32:07,190 --> 01:32:08,983
Spoke of him.

825
01:32:10,193 --> 01:32:11,486
What he did.

826
01:32:11,986 --> 01:32:13,863
I met him once.

827
01:32:15,699 --> 01:32:17,200
He was kind.

828
01:32:19,536 --> 01:32:21,371
He bowed to no one.

829
01:32:24,874 --> 01:32:26,543
Come with me.

830
01:32:26,626 --> 01:32:29,629
- Hmm?
- Come. With me.

831
01:32:48,732 --> 01:32:52,944
When a rebel gladiator dies,
we bury them here.

832
01:32:53,027 --> 01:32:57,407
"What we do in life echoes in eternity."

833
01:33:15,133 --> 01:33:17,010
This is Argento.

834
01:33:17,093 --> 01:33:18,595
This is Scatto.

835
01:33:59,010 --> 01:34:00,637
Cheers.

836
01:34:01,346 --> 01:34:02,722
And stop.

837
01:34:04,390 --> 01:34:08,478
For his treason against the lives

838
01:34:08,561 --> 01:34:13,274
of the emperors and the Roman state,

839
01:34:13,358 --> 01:34:16,069
General Justus Acacius,

840
01:34:17,487 --> 01:34:20,490
an enemy of the people!

841
01:34:20,573 --> 01:34:23,076
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

842
01:34:23,159 --> 01:34:25,495
- We love you, Acacius!
- You are a hero!

843
01:34:26,830 --> 01:34:29,916
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

844
01:35:01,322 --> 01:35:04,033
- <i>Vae victis.</i>
- General.

845
01:35:26,055 --> 01:35:28,016
Acacius!

846
01:35:29,225 --> 01:35:33,438
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

847
01:35:39,402 --> 01:35:43,406
From the vanquished city of Numidia,

848
01:35:44,616 --> 01:35:49,871
the victor of two conquests
in the Colosseum...

849
01:35:49,954 --> 01:35:52,457
Go now. <i>Vae victis.</i>

850
01:35:56,794 --> 01:35:59,672
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

851
01:35:59,756 --> 01:36:02,091
Hanno!

852
01:36:02,175 --> 01:36:04,969
Oh, Lord, any honor I have,

853
01:36:05,053 --> 01:36:06,763
- I will give it to you!
- It's too late.

854
01:36:06,846 --> 01:36:10,141
The Roman traitor or

855
01:36:10,224 --> 01:36:12,518
the barbarian hero.

856
01:36:13,269 --> 01:36:15,063
Let the gods decide.

857
01:36:15,146 --> 01:36:16,814
Lucius... wait.

858
01:36:18,316 --> 01:36:19,567
Wait! Wait!

859
01:36:29,535 --> 01:36:32,246
I am a vessel.

860
01:36:33,623 --> 01:36:35,833
Fill me with vengeance

861
01:36:36,834 --> 01:36:39,045
and vanquish the betrayer.

862
01:36:56,896 --> 01:36:59,148
- We love you, Acacius!
- Move it!

863
01:37:03,277 --> 01:37:04,946
Pick it up!

864
01:37:05,029 --> 01:37:07,407
Bravo, Hanno!

865
01:37:07,490 --> 01:37:08,950
We love you, Acacius!

866
01:37:09,033 --> 01:37:11,160
- What are you waiting for?
- You will die!

867
01:37:42,150 --> 01:37:43,401
I know who you are.

868
01:37:45,236 --> 01:37:47,238
Lucius Verus Aurelius.

869
01:38:00,585 --> 01:38:02,545
Acacius has raised his hand!

870
01:38:03,588 --> 01:38:05,923
He has surrendered.

871
01:38:13,473 --> 01:38:15,433
Let the gods decide.

872
01:38:33,034 --> 01:38:35,870
The gods have rendered their judgment.

873
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:40,541
Do what you must.

874
01:38:41,626 --> 01:38:44,003
But on my death, you have to know...

875
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:47,799
I love your mother, Lucilla.

876
01:38:49,300 --> 01:38:50,635
And your father...

877
01:38:53,429 --> 01:38:54,430
Maximus.

878
01:38:55,765 --> 01:38:57,934
I would have died for him.

879
01:38:58,017 --> 01:38:59,894
Kill him!

880
01:38:59,977 --> 01:39:02,647
Let him live! Please!

881
01:39:03,272 --> 01:39:06,818
Live! Live! Live! Live!

882
01:39:13,825 --> 01:39:15,493
Kill him!

883
01:39:17,495 --> 01:39:18,454
Kill him!

884
01:39:18,538 --> 01:39:19,789
Archers!

885
01:39:19,872 --> 01:39:21,707
- No!
- Kill him!

886
01:39:21,791 --> 01:39:24,335
Acacius! Acacius!

887
01:39:24,418 --> 01:39:26,129
Kill him!

888
01:39:26,212 --> 01:39:27,630
Kill him!

889
01:39:27,713 --> 01:39:29,173
Kill him! Kill him!

890
01:39:31,342 --> 01:39:32,635
Acacius!

891
01:39:42,812 --> 01:39:43,771
No!

892
01:39:44,438 --> 01:39:45,940
No!

893
01:39:46,023 --> 01:39:47,608
Acacius!

894
01:39:50,194 --> 01:39:51,404
Damn you!

895
01:39:54,115 --> 01:39:55,950
Death will be too good for you!

896
01:40:01,539 --> 01:40:04,667
Is this how Rome treats its heroes?

897
01:40:08,713 --> 01:40:10,173
Tell me!

898
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:16,888
If his life has no value,
what are yours worth?

899
01:40:16,971 --> 01:40:22,018
The gods have spoken!

900
01:40:35,948 --> 01:40:39,577
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

901
01:40:55,051 --> 01:40:58,054
For our own safety,
we should return to the palace.

902
01:41:06,437 --> 01:41:09,607
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

903
01:41:19,367 --> 01:41:21,702
Stay back! Stay back!

904
01:42:09,959 --> 01:42:14,338
Arishat!

905
01:42:31,939 --> 01:42:33,441
We had a bargain.

906
01:42:37,111 --> 01:42:40,406
I gave him to you. You let him live.

907
01:42:40,489 --> 01:42:42,158
And you got what you wanted.

908
01:42:42,241 --> 01:42:44,869
I always get what I want.
Why did you let him live?

909
01:42:44,952 --> 01:42:47,788
You bought a gladiator, not a slave.

910
01:42:49,540 --> 01:42:51,292
My will is my own.

911
01:42:53,544 --> 01:42:54,962
Ah...

912
01:42:55,046 --> 01:42:56,922
How blue is your blood?

913
01:42:57,798 --> 01:43:00,384
Perhaps the heart of a Roman

914
01:43:00,468 --> 01:43:02,678
beats in that chest.

915
01:43:08,392 --> 01:43:11,270
The greatest temple Rome ever built.

916
01:43:11,354 --> 01:43:12,897
The Colosseum.

917
01:43:12,980 --> 01:43:15,316
Because this is what they believe in.

918
01:43:15,399 --> 01:43:16,609
Power.

919
01:43:16,692 --> 01:43:19,820
They gather here to watch
the strong strike down the weak.

920
01:43:19,904 --> 01:43:21,739
- There has to be something else.
- There is nothing else.

921
01:43:21,822 --> 01:43:24,617
- There has to be another Rome.
- There is no other Rome.

922
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:27,745
- The "dream"?
- Mm.

923
01:43:27,828 --> 01:43:29,747
The dream of Rome?

924
01:43:29,830 --> 01:43:31,332
It's an old man's fantasy.

925
01:43:33,167 --> 01:43:34,502
Who are you?

926
01:43:37,588 --> 01:43:40,591
What was your name
before you traded it for a Roman one?

927
01:43:41,675 --> 01:43:43,094
You'll never know.

928
01:43:45,930 --> 01:43:47,515
I have a destiny.

929
01:43:51,018 --> 01:43:53,354
The gods delivered you to me.

930
01:43:56,399 --> 01:43:57,900
You will be my instrument.

931
01:43:57,983 --> 01:44:01,487
I will never be your instrument,
in this life or the next.

932
01:44:09,787 --> 01:44:12,957
That will not be my destiny.

933
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,669
But I will see your end.

934
01:44:37,690 --> 01:44:39,567
What else could I do?

935
01:44:39,650 --> 01:44:41,444
He and his bitch were plotting to kill us.

936
01:44:41,527 --> 01:44:44,196
Don't you hear them?
They're calling for our heads!

937
01:44:44,280 --> 01:44:46,323
The Praetorians will put down this crowd.

938
01:44:46,407 --> 01:44:48,159
- Like they have every other.
- You brought this on us.

939
01:44:48,242 --> 01:44:50,661
Filthy ape!

940
01:44:54,331 --> 01:44:56,041
Perhaps you should, uh,

941
01:44:57,168 --> 01:45:01,505
take Dondus elsewhere to comfort him?

942
01:45:11,098 --> 01:45:13,350
Forgive my brother's outburst.

943
01:45:15,269 --> 01:45:18,272
The disease that infects his loins
has spread to his brain.

944
01:45:18,939 --> 01:45:21,942
- Every day he gets worse.
- I will reason with him.

945
01:45:38,334 --> 01:45:41,462
I see you.

946
01:45:41,545 --> 01:45:43,547
I see you.

947
01:45:44,965 --> 01:45:47,176
Caracalla, Caracalla!

948
01:45:47,259 --> 01:45:48,886
Come on, stand up.

949
01:45:48,969 --> 01:45:51,055
Get up, get up. Not you.

950
01:45:51,138 --> 01:45:52,890
All right, there you go.

951
01:45:54,642 --> 01:45:56,977
Now, listen to me.

952
01:45:57,061 --> 01:45:58,646
What's the matter?

953
01:45:58,729 --> 01:46:01,398
Nothing's ever mine.

954
01:46:01,482 --> 01:46:03,817
Everything is ours, always.

955
01:46:03,901 --> 01:46:07,071
Even in the womb... ...he tried...

956
01:46:07,947 --> 01:46:11,283
to cut my umbilicus

957
01:46:11,367 --> 01:46:13,202
so that I couldn't have any more air.

958
01:46:13,285 --> 01:46:15,579
- You remember that, do you?
- Certainly.

959
01:46:15,663 --> 01:46:17,998
- Come, sit.
- One cannot forget.

960
01:46:18,082 --> 01:46:20,334
My conscience compels me.

961
01:46:20,417 --> 01:46:21,877
What?

962
01:46:21,961 --> 01:46:23,170
Sit.

963
01:46:23,254 --> 01:46:24,588
Your brother

964
01:46:25,506 --> 01:46:27,007
means to blame you

965
01:46:28,008 --> 01:46:30,427
in front of the entire Senate...

966
01:46:30,511 --> 01:46:31,887
But I did not do it!

967
01:46:31,971 --> 01:46:33,556
...for what's happening in the streets.

968
01:46:33,639 --> 01:46:36,016
- The chaos!
- He's lying!

969
01:46:36,100 --> 01:46:37,935
No testimony can be more damning

970
01:46:38,018 --> 01:46:41,480
than one brother against another.

971
01:46:41,564 --> 01:46:44,233
That's a lie! He always lies!

972
01:46:44,316 --> 01:46:46,777
He can be very persuasive.

973
01:46:46,860 --> 01:46:49,572
So? What will they do to me?

974
01:46:49,655 --> 01:46:52,449
Oh, I don't dare imagine.
But imagine this:

975
01:46:52,533 --> 01:46:54,535
What will they do to Dondus?

976
01:46:57,705 --> 01:47:00,541
What will they do

977
01:47:00,624 --> 01:47:02,001
to Dondus?

978
01:47:04,378 --> 01:47:05,629
It's your decision.

979
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:44,335
Brother.

980
01:47:48,005 --> 01:47:49,798
Put down the blade.

981
01:47:49,882 --> 01:47:51,008
You lie.

982
01:47:51,091 --> 01:47:52,885
- Give it to me.
- You always lie!

983
01:47:52,968 --> 01:47:53,927
Give it--

984
01:47:57,848 --> 01:48:00,100
Look at me. Look at me. Look at me.

985
01:48:00,184 --> 01:48:02,603
- Lie!
- Listen to me. Break the spell.

986
01:48:02,686 --> 01:48:04,688
- Lie!
- Break the spell!

987
01:48:04,772 --> 01:48:07,941
I've always protected you.
Because I love you.

988
01:48:08,609 --> 01:48:10,611
Come back. Help me.

989
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:34,635
Lucius.

990
01:48:56,407 --> 01:48:59,034
Never could have imagined
the fates would lead us here.

991
01:49:01,161 --> 01:49:02,913
And yet here we are.

992
01:49:04,623 --> 01:49:06,375
Everything has brought us full circle.

993
01:49:06,458 --> 01:49:09,545
You sent me away and yet fate

994
01:49:09,628 --> 01:49:12,089
brought me back
to the very ground where he died.

995
01:49:15,134 --> 01:49:16,093
This ring...

996
01:49:18,011 --> 01:49:19,680
belonged to my father.

997
01:49:23,767 --> 01:49:26,854
He gave it to your father, Maximus,

998
01:49:26,937 --> 01:49:28,772
as a token of trust.

999
01:49:30,190 --> 01:49:33,152
I gave it to Acacius for his valor.

1000
01:49:37,698 --> 01:49:39,867
This ring belonged to my wife.

1001
01:49:42,870 --> 01:49:44,329
I shall wear it next to yours.

1002
01:49:58,635 --> 01:50:01,054
I am truly sorry for Acacius.

1003
01:50:02,389 --> 01:50:05,184
I could not see the man.

1004
01:50:07,394 --> 01:50:09,229
He was a soldier of Rome.

1005
01:50:11,231 --> 01:50:12,566
There was a plan.

1006
01:50:13,901 --> 01:50:17,321
He was readying troops at Ostia
under the command of Darius Sextus.

1007
01:50:18,489 --> 01:50:21,492
Troops he was to lead
against the emperors.

1008
01:50:23,577 --> 01:50:27,915
Acacius. Maximus. Marcus Aurelius.

1009
01:50:29,082 --> 01:50:30,709
They lived and died for Rome.

1010
01:50:32,169 --> 01:50:33,587
We all do.

1011
01:50:35,672 --> 01:50:37,257
Is it true they intend to kill you?

1012
01:50:41,011 --> 01:50:43,222
One man or another
has had a sword against my neck

1013
01:50:43,305 --> 01:50:45,432
since the day my father died.

1014
01:50:48,685 --> 01:50:50,646
But now that I've found you,

1015
01:50:51,522 --> 01:50:53,273
it doesn't matter.

1016
01:50:54,691 --> 01:50:56,068
I am not afraid.

1017
01:50:56,151 --> 01:50:59,571
I've become well versed
in losing the things that I love.

1018
01:51:02,449 --> 01:51:05,577
But now that I've found you,
I have no desire to lose you again.

1019
01:51:08,664 --> 01:51:10,833
- You stand like him.
- Mm.

1020
01:51:11,625 --> 01:51:12,960
Alert.

1021
01:51:13,877 --> 01:51:14,962
Proud.

1022
01:51:17,214 --> 01:51:19,049
I do not have his strength.

1023
01:51:20,717 --> 01:51:22,803
I wish that were true.

1024
01:51:24,221 --> 01:51:27,391
I wish I were telling you
to flee this place.

1025
01:51:36,149 --> 01:51:37,234
Go now.

1026
01:51:45,576 --> 01:51:46,702
Strength and honor.

1027
01:51:49,246 --> 01:51:50,873
Strength and honor.

1028
01:52:03,552 --> 01:52:04,970
As Emperor,

1029
01:52:05,762 --> 01:52:07,347
I have convened

1030
01:52:08,348 --> 01:52:11,602
the Senate to appoint my First Consul

1031
01:52:11,685 --> 01:52:15,022
and bestow upon him the power
to administer the military

1032
01:52:15,105 --> 01:52:18,317
and civic functions of the Empire.

1033
01:52:22,195 --> 01:52:23,530
I name...

1034
01:52:24,698 --> 01:52:27,159
Citizen Dondus!

1035
01:52:34,124 --> 01:52:35,751
Hail Dondus!

1036
01:52:39,212 --> 01:52:40,672
Hail Dondus!

1037
01:52:42,716 --> 01:52:45,427
- Hail Dondus.
- Hail Dondus!

1038
01:52:45,510 --> 01:52:47,971
Hail Dondus!

1039
01:52:52,225 --> 01:52:54,061
As Second Consul...

1040
01:52:56,021 --> 01:52:57,481
I name...

1041
01:52:59,900 --> 01:53:01,151
Citizen...

1042
01:53:02,986 --> 01:53:04,321
Macrinus!

1043
01:53:07,282 --> 01:53:08,992
Hail Macrinus!

1044
01:53:09,076 --> 01:53:10,577
Hail Macrinus!

1045
01:53:10,661 --> 01:53:12,537
Hail Macrinus!

1046
01:53:13,914 --> 01:53:17,000
There will be
a triumphal parade to celebrate.

1047
01:53:17,084 --> 01:53:18,585
There will be games

1048
01:53:19,378 --> 01:53:21,380
and mass executions.

1049
01:53:24,508 --> 01:53:27,177
Long live the Empire!

1050
01:53:28,762 --> 01:53:31,765
- Long live the Empire!
- Long live the Empire!

1051
01:53:38,689 --> 01:53:39,856
Sit down.

1052
01:53:43,276 --> 01:53:45,946
I happen to have...

1053
01:53:49,533 --> 01:53:53,203
with good fortune and not a little skill...

1054
01:53:54,955 --> 01:53:58,083
the remaining emperor's ear.

1055
01:54:05,298 --> 01:54:07,551
I can speak logic to it...

1056
01:54:12,347 --> 01:54:14,808
and tame the madness in the street. But...

1057
01:54:17,811 --> 01:54:19,396
to restore order...

1058
01:54:21,481 --> 01:54:23,316
I must have power...

1059
01:54:27,070 --> 01:54:29,072
and command

1060
01:54:29,823 --> 01:54:31,742
over the Praetorian Army.

1061
01:54:37,664 --> 01:54:39,374
Ballot...

1062
01:54:41,585 --> 01:54:42,919
or hand?

1063
01:54:45,088 --> 01:54:47,591
- Aye!
- Aye!

1064
01:54:50,927 --> 01:54:52,512
Your humble servant.

1065
01:54:56,683 --> 01:54:58,185
Put your hands down.

1066
01:55:00,896 --> 01:55:02,355
You can sit down.

1067
01:55:15,952 --> 01:55:17,537
<i>Rome must fall.</i>

1068
01:55:20,290 --> 01:55:22,292
I need only give it a push.

1069
01:55:25,378 --> 01:55:27,547
And after Rome falls...

1070
01:55:28,507 --> 01:55:30,884
...what then?

1071
01:55:33,053 --> 01:55:35,055
You are your father's child.

1072
01:55:37,057 --> 01:55:39,684
His dream of Rome was never a dream.

1073
01:55:40,644 --> 01:55:41,853
It was a fiction.

1074
01:55:42,771 --> 01:55:45,065
"The best revenge is

1075
01:55:45,148 --> 01:55:49,027
to become unlike the one
who did the injury."

1076
01:55:49,111 --> 01:55:54,116
I have made myself unlike your father.

1077
01:55:54,199 --> 01:55:57,744
He spoke of dreams, I speak of truth.

1078
01:55:57,828 --> 01:56:00,247
And the only truth in my Rome

1079
01:56:01,832 --> 01:56:03,834
is the law of the strongest.

1080
01:56:06,169 --> 01:56:07,504
I was owned

1081
01:56:09,005 --> 01:56:10,507
by an emperor.

1082
01:56:13,510 --> 01:56:15,595
Now I control an empire.

1083
01:56:16,680 --> 01:56:19,933
Where else but in Rome can a man do that?

1084
01:56:25,230 --> 01:56:29,734
Do you recognize your father's mark on me?

1085
01:56:34,573 --> 01:56:35,866
If there is anything

1086
01:56:36,616 --> 01:56:37,951
you need...

1087
01:56:39,703 --> 01:56:41,371
in these last hours,

1088
01:56:42,372 --> 01:56:44,040
we will provide.

1089
01:56:49,754 --> 01:56:52,465
Your death will clear my path
to the throne.

1090
01:56:54,384 --> 01:56:57,387
Tomorrow there will be games.

1091
01:56:57,470 --> 01:56:59,055
And at them...

1092
01:56:59,973 --> 01:57:01,641
I will prevail.

1093
01:57:15,322 --> 01:57:16,781
Ravi!

1094
01:57:23,371 --> 01:57:25,665
Can you get me a message
to Ostia by morning?

1095
01:57:25,749 --> 01:57:27,500
What is in Ostia?

1096
01:57:27,584 --> 01:57:29,002
There is an army.

1097
01:57:31,254 --> 01:57:32,964
I'm asking you
to risk yourself, my friend,

1098
01:57:33,048 --> 01:57:35,175
in the service of something greater.

1099
01:57:38,094 --> 01:57:39,512
Ride to Ostia.

1100
01:57:40,764 --> 01:57:42,891
Take this ring to General Darius Sextus.

1101
01:57:42,974 --> 01:57:44,351
Are you listening?

1102
01:57:45,018 --> 01:57:46,853
Darius Sextus.

1103
01:57:47,771 --> 01:57:49,773
He will know it as Acacius's ring.

1104
01:57:52,734 --> 01:57:54,861
And, uh,

1105
01:57:55,779 --> 01:57:57,113
who shall I say has

1106
01:57:57,822 --> 01:57:59,491
sent me with this ring?

1107
01:58:02,869 --> 01:58:05,205
I am Lucius Verus Aurelius.

1108
01:58:06,456 --> 01:58:07,958
The Prince of Rome.

1109
01:58:09,209 --> 01:58:13,046
Tell him I am summoning the army
to the defense of a new Republic.

1110
01:58:21,721 --> 01:58:23,556
- Should I trust you?
- Yes.

1111
01:58:23,640 --> 01:58:25,100
- Should I?
- Yes.

1112
01:58:32,023 --> 01:58:34,693
Ravi! I need your keys.

1113
01:58:40,824 --> 01:58:42,492
Thank you.

1114
01:59:20,363 --> 01:59:22,782
Stop! Come back!

1115
01:59:53,563 --> 01:59:54,689
Who gave you this?

1116
01:59:55,690 --> 01:59:57,817
Lucius Verus Aurelius.

1117
01:59:59,069 --> 02:00:00,278
The Prince of Rome.

1118
02:00:53,456 --> 02:00:55,667
Must we kill Lucilla?

1119
02:00:58,128 --> 02:01:01,881
Until she dies,
you will never know peace.

1120
02:01:03,800 --> 02:01:04,801
Ever.

1121
02:01:15,687 --> 02:01:18,314
The people love her.
Her death will incite the mob.

1122
02:01:18,398 --> 02:01:20,984
If she dies and the streets
rise up in anger,

1123
02:01:21,067 --> 02:01:24,070
I shall deliver them Caracalla's head
and the people shall acclaim me.

1124
02:01:24,154 --> 02:01:27,740
That, my friend, is politics.

1125
02:01:30,577 --> 02:01:32,412
- Shall we?
- Yes.

1126
02:01:47,677 --> 02:01:49,804
Today will be your last fight, champion.

1127
02:01:50,889 --> 02:01:52,515
And our master has bestowed on you...

1128
02:01:54,893 --> 02:01:57,270
the wooden sword of freedom.

1129
02:02:01,274 --> 02:02:03,318
But you have to earn it first.

1130
02:02:03,401 --> 02:02:05,737
Today, you're gonna defend your mother.

1131
02:02:28,676 --> 02:02:31,513
Wood or steel, a point is still a point!

1132
02:02:58,790 --> 02:03:00,291
Wait for me.

1133
02:03:19,143 --> 02:03:20,895
In honor

1134
02:03:20,979 --> 02:03:25,316
of the acclamation of Emperor Caracalla,

1135
02:03:25,400 --> 02:03:31,364
First Consul Dondus
and Second Consul Macrinus,

1136
02:03:31,447 --> 02:03:35,994
and as punishment for her conspiracy
against the empire,

1137
02:03:36,077 --> 02:03:40,582
for her calumnies against
the emperor's imperial bloodline

1138
02:03:40,665 --> 02:03:44,502
and for fomenting military mutiny
along with her husband,

1139
02:03:44,586 --> 02:03:48,256
the queen will face divine justice

1140
02:03:48,339 --> 02:03:52,427
at the hands of the Praetorian Guard.

1141
02:04:16,909 --> 02:04:18,411
I am not a general.

1142
02:04:20,121 --> 02:04:23,625
But we are all soldiers.

1143
02:04:25,627 --> 02:04:27,420
And up until now,

1144
02:04:27,962 --> 02:04:31,799
we have fought for nothing more
than another day's survival.

1145
02:04:31,883 --> 02:04:33,718
What will you have us do?

1146
02:04:35,053 --> 02:04:38,431
Well, you can return to your cells
if you do not wish to fight this battle.

1147
02:04:38,514 --> 02:04:40,808
Or...

1148
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:43,895
you can join me.

1149
02:04:45,188 --> 02:04:47,899
And fight for a freedom
far beyond these walls.

1150
02:04:47,982 --> 02:04:48,983
Aye!

1151
02:04:49,734 --> 02:04:53,529
There once was a time when
honor meant something in Rome.

1152
02:04:55,239 --> 02:04:56,741
In this Rome

1153
02:04:57,659 --> 02:04:59,827
I no longer believe that exists.

1154
02:04:59,911 --> 02:05:01,913
We must find it!

1155
02:05:04,165 --> 02:05:05,833
And know this:

1156
02:05:07,168 --> 02:05:10,922
Where death is, we are not.

1157
02:05:12,924 --> 02:05:14,842
Where we are,

1158
02:05:15,593 --> 02:05:17,303
death is not!

1159
02:05:20,348 --> 02:05:21,599
By my sword.

1160
02:05:23,518 --> 02:05:25,269
Strength and honor.

1161
02:05:25,353 --> 02:05:27,313
Strength and honor!

1162
02:05:27,397 --> 02:05:29,065
Strength and honor!

1163
02:05:29,148 --> 02:05:30,983
Strength and honor!

1164
02:05:55,717 --> 02:05:57,844
Let it not be said

1165
02:05:57,927 --> 02:06:01,055
that the emperor is not merciful.

1166
02:06:01,889 --> 02:06:06,644
The queen will be granted
a single gladiator

1167
02:06:06,728 --> 02:06:10,523
to defend her
against the Praetorian Guard.

1168
02:06:20,491 --> 02:06:24,495
The champion, Hanno!

1169
02:06:28,332 --> 02:06:31,836
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

1170
02:07:37,485 --> 02:07:39,195
Yes!

1171
02:07:43,407 --> 02:07:45,243
Summon the cavalry. Put this down at once.

1172
02:07:46,786 --> 02:07:49,163
This is war! Real war!

1173
02:07:54,126 --> 02:07:57,505
The army of Acacius is advancing
just outside of Rome, sir.

1174
02:08:00,174 --> 02:08:01,634
We can still outflank them.

1175
02:08:01,717 --> 02:08:04,053
They have only 5,000 troops, no more.

1176
02:08:05,429 --> 02:08:06,931
How many are we?

1177
02:08:07,014 --> 02:08:08,391
Six thousand. Perhaps more.

1178
02:08:08,474 --> 02:08:10,142
Ride to the gate and hold them.

1179
02:09:01,903 --> 02:09:02,945
Filthy scum!

1180
02:09:16,834 --> 02:09:18,336
Lucius!

1181
02:09:20,129 --> 02:09:21,172
Give me the bow.

1182
02:09:44,987 --> 02:09:47,531
Go, my son. Lucius--

1183
02:09:47,615 --> 02:09:48,699
Shh-sh-sh-sh...

1184
02:09:48,950 --> 02:09:50,284
Horse!

1185
02:11:23,002 --> 02:11:25,129
Will nothing kill this barbarian?

1186
02:11:25,212 --> 02:11:27,757
My name is Lucius Verus Aurelius!

1187
02:11:27,840 --> 02:11:30,217
A man does not become
emperor by bloodline alone.

1188
02:11:30,301 --> 02:11:33,054
It must be taken by force
and kept by force.

1189
02:11:33,137 --> 02:11:34,972
Are you such a man as this?

1190
02:11:35,056 --> 02:11:36,515
I don't fight for power.

1191
02:11:37,308 --> 02:11:40,936
I fight to free Rome from men like you
and to return it to them.

1192
02:11:41,020 --> 02:11:43,856
The gods themselves want Rome reborn.

1193
02:11:43,939 --> 02:11:46,901
They sent me... to fulfill that task.

1194
02:11:46,984 --> 02:11:50,571
And what if your gods
sent me here to kill you?

1195
02:11:50,654 --> 02:11:51,655
Huh?

1196
02:11:52,823 --> 02:11:55,117
It's time to end this, Macrinus!

1197
02:12:31,112 --> 02:12:33,322
Hah!

1198
02:13:03,853 --> 02:13:05,229
Strength and honor,

1199
02:13:05,312 --> 02:13:06,814
my son.

1200
02:14:40,199 --> 02:14:41,909
You look to me to speak.

1201
02:14:44,119 --> 02:14:47,915
I know not what to say other than
we have all known too much death.

1202
02:14:49,166 --> 02:14:52,670
Let no more blood be spilt
in the name of tyranny.

1203
02:14:56,632 --> 02:14:59,176
My grandfather, Marcus Aurelius,

1204
02:14:59,260 --> 02:15:02,096
talked of a dream that would be Rome.

1205
02:15:03,138 --> 02:15:05,015
A dream that my father,

1206
02:15:06,267 --> 02:15:08,435
Maximus Decimus Meridius,

1207
02:15:09,186 --> 02:15:10,688
died for.

1208
02:15:11,939 --> 02:15:13,524
An ideal.

1209
02:15:16,277 --> 02:15:20,072
A city for the many
and a refuge for those in need.

1210
02:15:20,739 --> 02:15:23,200
A home worth fighting for.

1211
02:15:24,326 --> 02:15:28,622
A home that Maximus
spent his life defending.

1212
02:15:30,708 --> 02:15:32,543
That dream is lost.

1213
02:15:38,507 --> 02:15:40,134
But dare we...

1214
02:15:41,677 --> 02:15:44,305
rebuild that dream together?

1215
02:15:56,233 --> 02:15:57,985
What say you?

1216
02:16:04,366 --> 02:16:06,201
Aye!

1217
02:16:07,369 --> 02:16:08,662
Aye!

1218
02:16:09,413 --> 02:16:10,664
Aye!

1219
02:16:10,748 --> 02:16:15,085
Aye! Aye! Aye! Aye!

1220
02:17:19,817 --> 02:17:20,984
Mother.

1221
02:18:13,579 --> 02:18:15,747
Speak to me, Father.

1222
02:27:47,861 --> 02:27:48,862
