1
00:00:34,478 --> 00:00:36,808
Blessed by heaven and earth,

2
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:40,178
the Chaos Pearl was born.

3
00:00:40,588 --> 00:00:43,708
The Supreme Lord split it into two.

4
00:00:43,718 --> 00:00:46,040
The celestial energy within became the Spirit Pearl,

5
00:00:46,048 --> 00:00:48,874
while the demonic energy formed the Demon Orb.

6
00:00:48,888 --> 00:00:52,832
A Wrath of Heaven curse was cast on the Demon Orb,

7
00:00:52,838 --> 00:00:57,665
set to destroy it with lightning in three years.

8
00:00:58,138 --> 00:01:01,832
Later, because Shen Gongbao intervened,

9
00:01:01,838 --> 00:01:06,124
the Demon Orb reincarnated as Nezha, third son of Li Jing in Chentang Pass.

10
00:01:06,138 --> 00:01:10,832
The Spirit Pearl became Ao Bing, third son of the Dragon King.

11
00:01:10,832 --> 00:01:12,938
By fate,

12
00:01:12,938 --> 00:01:16,808
the two became best friends.

13
00:01:16,808 --> 00:01:20,308
Nezha, influenced by his parents,

14
00:01:20,318 --> 00:01:22,290
shed his demonic nature,

15
00:01:22,288 --> 00:01:24,808
and saved Chentang Pass.

16
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:27,058
Together with Ao Bing,

17
00:01:27,058 --> 00:01:29,278
they faced the Wrath of Heaven,

18
00:01:29,278 --> 00:01:30,665
and at last

19
00:01:30,678 --> 00:01:35,040
changed their destinies.

20
00:01:50,258 --> 00:01:53,018
Though you've survived the wrath,

21
00:01:53,028 --> 00:01:55,249
your bodies were destroyed...

22
00:01:55,258 --> 00:01:57,082
without which

23
00:01:57,088 --> 00:02:00,624
the soul will soon fade into oblivion.

24
00:02:00,638 --> 00:02:02,915
The Sacred Lotus protects and nurtures spirit.

25
00:02:02,928 --> 00:02:05,332
I will now use it to recreate

26
00:02:05,328 --> 00:02:08,290
your physical forms.

27
00:02:37,332 --> 00:02:39,290
- Wow
- Stunning

28
00:02:39,332 --> 00:02:40,290
Let's get to work!

29
00:03:14,749 --> 00:03:15,832
Something's off...

30
00:03:15,832 --> 00:03:16,665
Is it?

31
00:03:16,665 --> 00:03:17,957
The lotus root must be powdered

32
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,249
to make your bodies.

33
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,582
Did you just scratch your feet with that hand?

34
00:03:22,582 --> 00:03:23,915
Oh, don't worry.

35
00:03:23,915 --> 00:03:26,165
My foot is Just a little sticky.
It just needs a quick wash.

36
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:29,332
I wasn't worried about your foot.

37
00:03:29,915 --> 00:03:31,999
Did you just blow your nose with that hand?

38
00:03:31,999 --> 00:03:33,832
No, not me.

39
00:03:33,832 --> 00:03:36,665
It's just lotus powder.
See?  Lotus powder.

40
00:03:38,415 --> 00:03:39,832
It's ready to go.

41
00:03:40,665 --> 00:03:41,790
Here, come on.

42
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,165
One booger for each of you.

43
00:03:43,582 --> 00:03:44,624
I mean one serving.

44
00:03:45,665 --> 00:03:47,665
Chop chop! Let's save your souls!

45
00:03:47,665 --> 00:03:48,999
I'd rather...

46
00:03:48,999 --> 00:03:50,665
Pain the neck, you little fools!

47
00:03:57,332 --> 00:03:58,415
It worked!

48
00:03:58,832 --> 00:03:59,624
Hang on.

49
00:04:01,249 --> 00:04:02,415
What is this?

50
00:04:02,415 --> 00:04:03,332
Oh, thank you,

51
00:04:03,332 --> 00:04:05,832
I've been looking all over for that.

52
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,207
Time for shaping.

53
00:04:12,665 --> 00:04:15,415
Flying Pig's memory is unmatched,

54
00:04:15,415 --> 00:04:19,165
so is his skill at carving.

55
00:04:20,332 --> 00:04:22,082
Perfect recreation, right?

56
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,915
Thanks, Piggy.

57
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:29,957
Don't move, your body's not ready yet.

58
00:04:32,457 --> 00:04:33,082
Master Immortal,

59
00:04:33,082 --> 00:04:35,249
I've mobilized all of Chentang's forces

60
00:04:35,249 --> 00:04:37,332
to guard Shen Gongbao and the Eastern Sea dragons.

61
00:04:37,332 --> 00:04:38,499
Not to worry,

62
00:04:38,499 --> 00:04:40,124
the dragons are watching the Abyss monsters,

63
00:04:40,124 --> 00:04:41,665
none of which can escape.

64
00:04:41,665 --> 00:04:43,749
Shen Gongbao is no threat on his own.

65
00:04:44,082 --> 00:04:46,415
Take a look at this!

66
00:04:46,415 --> 00:04:48,332
Isn't this incredible?

67
00:04:48,332 --> 00:04:49,957
Whoa!

68
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,624
He learned from the best.

69
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,415
But,

70
00:04:52,415 --> 00:04:54,124
do we have to be exactly the same?

71
00:04:54,124 --> 00:04:55,457
Can't you make me look better?

72
00:04:55,457 --> 00:04:56,457
Huh?

73
00:04:59,165 --> 00:04:59,749
That's right.

74
00:04:59,749 --> 00:05:01,749
Parents always want the best for their kids, right?

75
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:03,249
Right.

76
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:04,832
Make me tall and hunky.

77
00:05:05,165 --> 00:05:07,457
Also hauntingly handsome

78
00:05:07,457 --> 00:05:09,957
A man must be strong and striking,

79
00:05:10,415 --> 00:05:12,207
as well as demure and mindful.

80
00:05:12,207 --> 00:05:14,332
But also cute and lovable.

81
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:17,582
Can you just make up your minds?

82
00:05:17,582 --> 00:05:18,665
Tall and hunky,

83
00:05:18,665 --> 00:05:20,415
With a touch of handsomeness.

84
00:05:20,415 --> 00:05:21,749
Strong and striking.

85
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:23,874
Yet super adorable.

86
00:05:27,957 --> 00:05:28,749
What's this?

87
00:05:28,749 --> 00:05:30,582
He says... "Get to work, then"

88
00:05:30,582 --> 00:05:31,540
Right!

89
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,874
I should've taken over earlier.

90
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,374
DIY is always the best.

91
00:05:34,374 --> 00:05:36,290
This could take awhile.

92
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,665
Let's finish you first.

93
00:05:38,665 --> 00:05:40,665
You were born of the water element,

94
00:05:40,665 --> 00:05:42,332
so you must be tempered by pure water.

95
00:06:00,374 --> 00:06:01,249
Open Lotus!

96
00:06:08,832 --> 00:06:11,165
There we go.

97
00:06:11,165 --> 00:06:12,999
Are you finished?

98
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,124
Almost...

99
00:06:19,749 --> 00:06:22,540
This version is surely the most dazzling,

100
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,832
but fine-tuning will take a long time.

101
00:06:25,832 --> 00:06:27,207
How about we just use the first one for now?

102
00:06:27,207 --> 00:06:29,582
Yeah, the first version will do.

103
00:06:29,665 --> 00:06:31,499
I agree.

104
00:06:32,499 --> 00:06:35,082
Right.

105
00:06:35,457 --> 00:06:37,457
You were born of the fire element,

106
00:06:37,457 --> 00:06:39,790
so you must be refined in pure flame.

107
00:06:48,749 --> 00:06:50,124
Sir!

108
00:06:50,124 --> 00:06:51,374
An enemy has been spotted at sea.

109
00:06:51,374 --> 00:06:52,624
It seems to be Shen Gongbao.

110
00:06:52,624 --> 00:06:53,874
How many are with him?

111
00:06:53,874 --> 00:06:54,749
Just him.

112
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:56,582
What shall we do?

113
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,749
Carry on with your spell.

114
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:59,415
We'll handle the intruder.

115
00:06:59,415 --> 00:07:00,249
Master Immortal,

116
00:07:00,249 --> 00:07:01,415
let me go plead with my master.

117
00:07:01,415 --> 00:07:01,915
Don't move!

118
00:07:01,915 --> 00:07:03,707
Until another incense stick is fully burnt,

119
00:07:03,707 --> 00:07:05,124
your body won't be ready.

120
00:07:33,457 --> 00:07:34,790
Shen Gongbao,

121
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,999
to what do we owe this honor?

122
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,999
Now that you know of my plan with the dragons,

123
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:44,665
I can't help but feel un...uneasy.

124
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:46,790
Chentang Pass is heavily guarded,

125
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,790
and Master Taiyi is within the city.

126
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:51,874
You, alone, can't accomplish much.

127
00:07:51,874 --> 00:07:58,332
Who... who said I'm alone?

128
00:07:58,832 --> 00:08:01,082
[Two hours ago, Dragon Palace]

129
00:08:01,082 --> 00:08:04,749
If they find out about the Spirit Pearl,

130
00:08:04,749 --> 00:08:05,249
not only will you fail to avenge your son,

131
00:08:05,249 --> 00:08:07,665
[Queen of Western Sea]
not only will you fail to avenge your son,

132
00:08:07,665 --> 00:08:09,957
[Queen of Western Sea]
but the entire Eastern Dragon Clan

133
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:10,665
[Dragon King of Eastern Sea]
but the entire Eastern Dragon Clan

134
00:08:10,665 --> 00:08:13,128
[Dragon King of Eastern Sea]
will bear the blame.

135
00:08:13,124 --> 00:08:14,665
When the truth comes out,

136
00:08:14,665 --> 00:08:15,165
you'll be cast into the abyss of purgatory,

137
00:08:15,165 --> 00:08:16,457
[Dragon King of Southern Sea]
you'll be cast into the abyss of purgatory,

138
00:08:16,457 --> 00:08:18,582
[Dragon King of Southern Sea]
surrounded by all your old "friends".

139
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:19,999
[Dragon King of Southern Sea]
Let's see how they welcome you.

140
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:20,165
Let's see how we welcome you.

141
00:08:20,165 --> 00:08:22,290
[Dragon King of Northern Sea]
Stuck as you are in Dragon Palace...

142
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:22,790
[Dragon King of Northern Sea]
How could you avenge your son?

143
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,874
How could you avenge your son?

144
00:08:24,874 --> 00:08:26,665
Even I feel nervous for you.

145
00:08:35,832 --> 00:08:39,790
You fools are in no place to gloat.

146
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:42,415
I was simply trying to help.

147
00:08:42,415 --> 00:08:44,790
But it seems that you

148
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,415
don't appreciate it.

149
00:08:46,415 --> 00:08:48,207
Hmm?

150
00:08:55,457 --> 00:08:58,874
You must've forgotten what I'm capable of.

151
00:09:01,915 --> 00:09:03,040
Ah!

152
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,207
I know this one.

153
00:09:04,207 --> 00:09:07,540
The Sky... Sky... Sky...

154
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,832
Sky Splitting Claw.

155
00:09:09,832 --> 00:09:11,124
Thank you.

156
00:09:13,249 --> 00:09:17,790
Master Shen can take this claw to Chentang Pass,

157
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,082
and use it to tear open a rift leading back to me.

158
00:09:21,082 --> 00:09:27,749
The Abyss Monsters can then help you destroy your enemy.

159
00:09:37,874 --> 00:09:40,832
[Sky-Splitting Thunder Whip]

160
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,290
The Abyss Monsters

161
00:10:18,915 --> 00:10:20,582
How... is that possible?

162
00:10:20,582 --> 00:10:22,874
They've been trapped by the Suppression Seal for a thousand years,

163
00:10:22,874 --> 00:10:24,290
how could they possibly escape?

164
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,915
The dragons... have they already released them?

165
00:10:25,915 --> 00:10:28,832
Even with the Sea-Stabilizing Chains binding us,

166
00:10:28,832 --> 00:10:31,582
and no way to escape,

167
00:10:31,582 --> 00:10:34,999
this tactic will guarantee victory.

168
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:36,915
What do you say, my brother?

169
00:10:36,915 --> 00:10:40,207
Surely you wouldn't help out of generosity

170
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:41,999
Get to the point.

171
00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:43,624
What's your price?

172
00:10:45,165 --> 00:10:47,124
In this purgatory,

173
00:10:47,124 --> 00:10:48,790
where flames burn our bodies,

174
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,665
every day feels like a year.

175
00:10:50,665 --> 00:10:53,249
If you could lower the lava's heat a little,

176
00:10:53,249 --> 00:10:55,790
to ease our suffering,

177
00:10:56,415 --> 00:10:59,957
we'd serve you with all our might.

178
00:11:01,332 --> 00:11:02,457
What's going on?

179
00:11:02,457 --> 00:11:04,374
What is Shen Gongbao up to now?

180
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,415
Finally, we're out! Yay!

181
00:11:16,249 --> 00:11:18,165
Bye-bye!

182
00:11:21,582 --> 00:11:23,540
Vile.

183
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,415
We're doomed.

184
00:11:24,415 --> 00:11:27,082
How will we explain this to General Li now?

185
00:11:27,082 --> 00:11:28,624
Luckily no one saw us.

186
00:11:28,624 --> 00:11:29,665
Here.

187
00:11:29,665 --> 00:11:30,415
What's this for?

188
00:11:30,415 --> 00:11:31,582
I'll break your arms

189
00:11:31,582 --> 00:11:32,582
and then you break my legs.

190
00:11:32,582 --> 00:11:33,582
We'll say the Yaksha did it.

191
00:11:33,582 --> 00:11:34,415
Oh.

192
00:11:34,415 --> 00:11:36,707
When the general sees how badly we're hurt,

193
00:11:36,707 --> 00:11:37,790
he won't blame us.

194
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:38,832
Give it your best shot.

195
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:40,082
Hit me hard!

196
00:11:43,582 --> 00:11:44,165
Hey!

197
00:11:45,082 --> 00:11:45,915
Hey!

198
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,332
Hey, you two!

199
00:11:51,915 --> 00:11:52,957
Master Immortal,

200
00:11:52,957 --> 00:11:54,124
you're here!

201
00:11:54,124 --> 00:11:55,332
Hee hee hee!

202
00:11:55,332 --> 00:11:56,457
Ha ha ha!

203
00:11:56,457 --> 00:11:57,999
He let the Yaksha get away!

204
00:11:57,999 --> 00:11:58,790
What?

205
00:11:58,832 --> 00:12:00,957
It was all your fault.

206
00:12:00,957 --> 00:12:02,457
Who are you to point fingers?

207
00:12:02,457 --> 00:12:03,457
Who are you to play innocent?

208
00:12:06,249 --> 00:12:07,415
Oh my,

209
00:12:07,415 --> 00:12:08,832
Dumb and Dumber!

210
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:09,957
Hey!

211
00:12:09,957 --> 00:12:11,707
You two boneheads!

212
00:12:11,707 --> 00:12:13,582
Get over here and guard me!

213
00:12:14,082 --> 00:12:15,707
Yes, Sir! Right away!

214
00:13:26,665 --> 00:13:28,457
Show no mercy.

215
00:14:22,124 --> 00:14:22,832
Shen Gongbao!

216
00:14:22,832 --> 00:14:24,207
Ao Bing is not dead.

217
00:14:24,207 --> 00:14:26,832
Chentang Pass and the dragons will not fight when they learn of this.

218
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:28,957
Taiyi is rebuilding Ao Bing's body right now.

219
00:14:32,082 --> 00:14:33,874
Liar!

220
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:35,874
Hmm?

221
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:36,749
The shield...

222
00:14:38,957 --> 00:14:39,665
No!

223
00:14:57,082 --> 00:14:57,999
Master!

224
00:14:58,749 --> 00:14:59,749
Ao Bing!

225
00:14:59,749 --> 00:15:01,624
Master Taiyi has built me a new body.

226
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:02,582
Cease fire! Please!

227
00:15:03,249 --> 00:15:03,874
Shen Gongbao,

228
00:15:03,874 --> 00:15:04,749
I saved your disciple.

229
00:15:04,749 --> 00:15:05,915
How will you thank me?

230
00:15:05,915 --> 00:15:06,999
So,

231
00:15:06,999 --> 00:15:09,999
that must be Nezha in there.

232
00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:14,374
Why, you ungrateful scumbag!

233
00:15:14,374 --> 00:15:15,040
Master!

234
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,582
They must die!

235
00:15:22,749 --> 00:15:23,957
Ha ha ha!

236
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:26,082
You think you can break this shield?

237
00:15:26,082 --> 00:15:28,082
Hit me! Come on!

238
00:15:54,457 --> 00:15:55,749
No!

239
00:16:28,832 --> 00:16:30,665
That aura...

240
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,499
Ao Bing!

241
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,374
Father!

242
00:16:50,624 --> 00:16:53,665
[Ao Guang]

243
00:16:53,665 --> 00:16:55,582
Father!

244
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:57,665
I failed the mission to save our kind.

245
00:16:57,665 --> 00:16:58,249
No.

246
00:16:58,249 --> 00:16:59,415
None of that matters.

247
00:16:59,415 --> 00:17:01,082
I just want you to be safe.

248
00:17:01,082 --> 00:17:02,582
As long as you're here,

249
00:17:02,582 --> 00:17:04,415
that's enough for me.

250
00:17:12,082 --> 00:17:12,915
Open Lotus!

251
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,082
Your body, what is wrong...

252
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,499
Please, he's literally a newborn.

253
00:17:23,499 --> 00:17:25,415
How could he take a hit like that?

254
00:17:25,415 --> 00:17:26,999
Ao Bing!

255
00:17:26,999 --> 00:17:28,249
Wait! You're not ready yet!

256
00:17:28,249 --> 00:17:29,415
Don't move! Don't move!

257
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:30,874
Ao Bing, what's going on?

258
00:17:30,874 --> 00:17:33,249
Never move before your body's finished!

259
00:17:33,249 --> 00:17:34,582
If your body exceeds its limit,

260
00:17:34,582 --> 00:17:36,082
it will collapse!

261
00:17:36,082 --> 00:17:37,499
For heaven's sake...

262
00:17:37,499 --> 00:17:38,374
Fatty!

263
00:17:38,374 --> 00:17:41,415
Make another bod... body for Ao Bing, now!

264
00:17:41,415 --> 00:17:42,249
Huh?

265
00:17:42,249 --> 00:17:43,582
Making two bodies back-to-back

266
00:17:43,582 --> 00:17:45,540
has completely drained the Sacred Lotus's energy.

267
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,082
Without a body, won't his soul scatter?

268
00:17:47,082 --> 00:17:48,165
Master, do something!

269
00:17:48,165 --> 00:17:49,165
Without the Sacred Lotus,

270
00:17:49,165 --> 00:17:51,290
there's nothing I can do.

271
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,707
It's okay.

272
00:17:52,707 --> 00:17:55,707
I took your place as the Spirit Pearl. I deserve this.

273
00:17:55,832 --> 00:17:57,582
If my sacrifice

274
00:17:57,582 --> 00:17:59,624
can bring you back to life,

275
00:17:59,624 --> 00:18:01,582
then it's a fair price to pay.

276
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:02,707
Nobody asked for your help!

277
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,415
I was happy being the Demon Orb.

278
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,874
Don't you dare die!

279
00:18:06,457 --> 00:18:07,874
Father,

280
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:10,832
please spare Chentang Pass.

281
00:18:11,249 --> 00:18:14,374
We should stop making these terrible mistakes.

282
00:18:14,374 --> 00:18:17,582
This is my final wish.

283
00:18:22,915 --> 00:18:24,124
There has to be some other way.

284
00:18:24,124 --> 00:18:25,957
There has to be.

285
00:18:25,957 --> 00:18:28,082
You! Try harder!

286
00:18:28,082 --> 00:18:29,790
Let Ao Bing share your body for now.

287
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:30,874
Share your body.

288
00:18:30,874 --> 00:18:33,832
Two souls sharing one body,

289
00:18:33,832 --> 00:18:35,457
rejection is inevitable.

290
00:18:35,457 --> 00:18:38,332
The Spirit Pearl and Demon Orb come from the same source.

291
00:18:38,332 --> 00:18:39,332
Sharing one body

292
00:18:39,332 --> 00:18:41,540
for seven days shouldn't be a problem.

293
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:41,999
That's it!

294
00:18:41,999 --> 00:18:43,082
Ao Bing, come over!

295
00:18:43,082 --> 00:18:43,874
Quick!

296
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:45,582
Okay.

297
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:54,499
This feels... strange...

298
00:18:54,499 --> 00:18:55,665
Ao Bing, are you here?

299
00:18:55,665 --> 00:18:56,749
Yes, I am.

300
00:18:56,749 --> 00:18:59,082
I can hear your voice in my head!

301
00:18:59,082 --> 00:19:00,290
This is fun!

302
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:02,499
But this is only a temporary fix.

303
00:19:02,499 --> 00:19:04,582
What happens after seven days?

304
00:19:04,582 --> 00:19:08,915
There's a potion in the vault of Yu Xu Palace, Elixir Reparo.

305
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:11,040
It can restore the divine power of magical items.

306
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,165
With it,

307
00:19:12,165 --> 00:19:15,290
the Sacred Lotus will bloom again.

308
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:17,749
But how will you obtain it?

309
00:19:17,749 --> 00:19:20,165
I'll go to the Supreme Lord himself and beg for it.

310
00:19:20,165 --> 00:19:21,374
Or are you planning to

311
00:19:21,374 --> 00:19:23,290
report on me and the dragons?

312
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:27,624
The Supreme Lord wouldn't say... save a son of the dragons.

313
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:28,957
If asking doesn't work,

314
00:19:28,957 --> 00:19:30,332
then we'll just take it.

315
00:19:30,332 --> 00:19:32,457
Yu Xu Palace is at the core of the Chan Sect,

316
00:19:32,457 --> 00:19:33,957
protected by formidable powers.

317
00:19:33,957 --> 00:19:35,165
For my son,

318
00:19:35,165 --> 00:19:37,624
I'll break into the Court of Heaven if I have to.

319
00:19:37,624 --> 00:19:39,415
Your Majesty, calm down.

320
00:19:39,415 --> 00:19:41,165
I might have a plan.

321
00:19:41,165 --> 00:19:43,540
Chan disciples who excel in their training

322
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,374
can participate in the Ascension Trial.

323
00:19:46,374 --> 00:19:49,582
Passing the trial grants not only immortality,

324
00:19:49,582 --> 00:19:51,790
but also the right to choose one

325
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:55,082
ma... magic item from the Yu Xu Vault as a reward.

326
00:19:55,082 --> 00:19:55,749
Are you suggesting

327
00:19:55,749 --> 00:19:57,040
Nezha should participate in the trial

328
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,249
to obtain the elixir?

329
00:19:58,249 --> 00:19:59,249
No, no, no!

330
00:19:59,249 --> 00:20:00,665
He's beaming with demonic energy!

331
00:20:00,665 --> 00:20:02,874
As soon as he uses his powers, he'll be exposed!

332
00:20:02,874 --> 00:20:04,540
Isn't Ao Bing sharing Nezha's body?

333
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,249
His divine aura can completely mask the demonic energy.

334
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:09,915
As long as he passes the trial within seven days,

335
00:20:09,915 --> 00:20:12,874
not only will we have the el... elixir...

336
00:20:12,874 --> 00:20:13,915
But he will also

337
00:20:13,915 --> 00:20:15,040
become immortal.

338
00:20:15,707 --> 00:20:17,582
Then I wouldn't be a demon anymore?

339
00:20:17,582 --> 00:20:20,874
This will save both Ao Bing and Nezha.

340
00:20:20,874 --> 00:20:23,874
Eve... everyone is happy.

341
00:20:23,874 --> 00:20:25,790
That wouldn't be right.

342
00:20:26,249 --> 00:20:28,415
Then what do you suggest?

343
00:20:28,415 --> 00:20:30,415
Follow the rules.

344
00:20:30,415 --> 00:20:31,832
Come clean with the Supreme Lord

345
00:20:31,832 --> 00:20:33,749
and trust his judgment.

346
00:20:33,749 --> 00:20:36,040
My wife and I will also plead for mercy,

347
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,749
so the sins of the parents don't affect the children.

348
00:20:39,749 --> 00:20:41,790
Mere mortals,

349
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,915
you have only decades of life experience,

350
00:20:43,915 --> 00:20:47,707
how dare you lecture me about morality?

351
00:20:54,332 --> 00:20:56,249
I've lived for thousands of years.

352
00:20:56,249 --> 00:20:58,999
I've lived for thousands of years.

353
00:20:58,999 --> 00:21:02,290
Let me tell you one truth and one truth only.

354
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:04,540
If my son dies,

355
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:08,415
Chentang Pass dies with him.

356
00:21:15,249 --> 00:21:17,165
Stop!

357
00:21:17,165 --> 00:21:19,082
Ao Bing is my friend.

358
00:21:19,082 --> 00:21:20,999
Of course I will save him!

359
00:21:20,999 --> 00:21:23,374
But if you think of harming Chentang Pass,

360
00:21:23,374 --> 00:21:24,957
I'll smash your Dragon Palace

361
00:21:24,957 --> 00:21:27,249
into P.I.E.C.E.S!

362
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,999
Except for Nezha and Taiyi,

363
00:21:33,999 --> 00:21:37,582
no one leaves Chentang Pass from now on.

364
00:21:37,582 --> 00:21:40,249
If in seven days I don't see Elixir Reparo,

365
00:21:40,249 --> 00:21:43,040
or if the news of my clan gets out,

366
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,415
I'll let Chentang Pass

367
00:21:45,415 --> 00:21:47,374
sink forever.

368
00:21:47,999 --> 00:21:50,124
I don't trust my siblings,

369
00:21:50,124 --> 00:21:52,665
and I can't stay out of my body for long.

370
00:21:52,665 --> 00:21:54,499
The fate of Chentang Pass

371
00:21:54,499 --> 00:21:56,207
is in your hands.

372
00:22:00,749 --> 00:22:01,582
Yes.

373
00:22:01,582 --> 00:22:02,790
Exactly.

374
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:05,082
There's no message that can't be conveyed

375
00:22:05,082 --> 00:22:06,332
with just a nod.

376
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:15,165
Lord Li,

377
00:22:15,165 --> 00:22:17,415
we're all here to say goodbye to Young Master Nezha.

378
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:21,958
We want to thank him for saving the entire city.

379
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:23,041
You're too kind.

380
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,500
My son has caused enough trouble

381
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,708
over the years.

382
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:30,416
We always knew the Young Master was destined for greatness.

383
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:31,666
Look at him,

384
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:33,083
a wide forehead,

385
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:34,250
broad face,

386
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,875
prominent nose,

387
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:37,750
full cheeks and thick lips.

388
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:41,250
All signs of a true hero!

389
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:44,208
I've never been wrong in reading faces.

390
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:50,791
Young Master, remember to brush your teeth after meals!

391
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:53,333
Boss!

392
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:56,416
the Demon Slayers is now re-branded as the Nezha Gang.

393
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,750
All members will follow your orders.

394
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:01,083
Young Master, want to practice calligraphy?

395
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:02,000
I'm here for you!

396
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,041
Young Master, you're three years old now.

397
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:04,458
It's time to get a girlfriend.

398
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:05,250
Would you like to learn an instrument?

399
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,708
We're proficient in all of them.

400
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:10,458
I want to

401
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:11,625
play shuttlecock.

402
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,000
What?

403
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,875
It's fun.

404
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:17,291
Anyone?

405
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:21,916
I'll play with you.

406
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:25,125
Didn't you always want to play shuttlecock with me?

407
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:26,041
Well...

408
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:27,541
he's a bit rough with his kicks.

409
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:28,791
Ha ha ha!

410
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:30,541
I'm a general of war!

411
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:33,583
Dad.

412
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:35,000
That's my boy!

413
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:37,625
How about...

414
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:38,583
we do it another day?

415
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:39,916
Nonsense!

416
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:41,708
Why stop when you're having fun?

417
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:43,750
It's fine. I'm fine.

418
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,791
I'll join too!

419
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:46,291
My lady, you don't have to do this.

420
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,500
Are you looking down on me?

421
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,958
I'm also a general of war!

422
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:50,250
Nezha,

423
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,291
catch this!

424
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:54,208
Kiddo,

425
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:55,750
how did you miss that?

426
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:58,083
If only I weren't the Demon Orb...

427
00:23:58,083 --> 00:23:59,333
What was that?

428
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:00,083
Nothing.

429
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:01,833
It's time to go.

430
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:03,208
Before you go,

431
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,666
will you give your mother

432
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:06,958
a big hug?

433
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:12,083
Please, people are watching.

434
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:15,083
Wait.

435
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:18,291
Here are some snacks I made.

436
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,791
For you and your master on the road.

437
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:20,750
Okay, okay.

438
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,333
We need to go.

439
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:21,958
Hey!

440
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:23,375
I'm not on board yet!

441
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:30,791
Your body isn't fully fixed.

442
00:24:30,791 --> 00:24:32,208
Don't use too much force.

443
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:33,291
Okay, okay.

444
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:35,041
And watch your temper.

445
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:37,333
Try to stay calm out there.

446
00:24:37,916 --> 00:24:39,875
Without me and your father by your side,

447
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:42,958
take care of yourself.

448
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:45,125
You silly child.

449
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:47,166
What's wrong with just a hug?

450
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:48,291
It's too cringey.

451
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:49,166
It's not a farewell anyway.

452
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:50,250
Let's move.

453
00:25:07,541 --> 00:25:08,583
Why are you sighing?

454
00:25:08,583 --> 00:25:09,541
Does it taste bad?

455
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:10,291
Food, food, food.

456
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:11,291
All you know is food.

457
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:12,333
Look at me,

458
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:13,541
I'm too worried to even eat!

459
00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:15,333
Have you thought about how to pass the trial?

460
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:18,750
What is the trial anyway?

461
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,125
It'll test the progress of your cultivation.

462
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:22,541
In front of the judges,

463
00:25:22,541 --> 00:25:23,583
you must defeat, barehanded,

464
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:25,250
three demon kings of earth-monster level.

465
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,125
Fighting...

466
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:27,333
That's my specialty!

467
00:25:27,666 --> 00:25:29,208
But as soon as you give off demonic energy,

468
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:30,166
your identity will be exposed.

469
00:25:30,166 --> 00:25:31,041
Just let Ao Bing control my body.

470
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:32,041
His divine energy

471
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:33,583
will be just as powerful.

472
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:34,750
Sounds easy.

473
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,708
Let's try.

474
00:25:36,791 --> 00:25:37,541
Nezha,

475
00:25:37,541 --> 00:25:39,375
fully relax your body.

476
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:42,583
Let Ao Bing take control and fight me.

477
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,041
Ao Bing, what are you doing?

478
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,208
Steady!

479
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:49,916
When a soul inhabits another body,

480
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:52,083
unless its willpower is much stronger than the host's,

481
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,333
it won't be able to fully take control.

482
00:25:57,541 --> 00:25:58,708
Nezha, back off and relax.

483
00:25:58,708 --> 00:26:00,250
The harder you push,

484
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,000
the less Ao Bing can control.

485
00:26:02,916 --> 00:26:03,958
Use your leg!

486
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:05,500
Sweep him, sweep him!

487
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:14,750
Don't panic!

488
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,708
I'm coming...

489
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:19,916
for you.

490
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:28,208
Having fun, eh?

491
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:29,458
We're almost at Yu Xu Palace,

492
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:30,708
and you're still messing around.

493
00:26:30,708 --> 00:26:31,625
Look at yourself,

494
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:32,958
what kind of mentor are you?

495
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,458
Stand here and reflect on your mistakes.

496
00:26:34,458 --> 00:26:36,291
No meals until you figure it out!

497
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:37,416
You're a grown man.

498
00:26:37,416 --> 00:26:39,458
Stop acting like a reckless teenager.

499
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:41,666
I got it!

500
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:44,666
The Sleepy-Slumber Pill.

501
00:26:44,666 --> 00:26:45,916
What's that?

502
00:26:45,916 --> 00:26:48,083
Take this, and you'll fall asleep immediately.

503
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:48,958
Once you're asleep,

504
00:26:48,958 --> 00:26:51,791
Ao Bing can fully control your body.

505
00:26:51,791 --> 00:26:52,500
Brilliant!

506
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:55,125
One is enough!

507
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:57,291
Should've told me...

508
00:26:57,291 --> 00:26:57,875
earlier.

509
00:26:59,958 --> 00:27:01,291
Perfect.

510
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:09,625
Master Taiyi?

511
00:27:10,958 --> 00:27:13,500
Now this feels like the real deal.

512
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:14,875
What's wrong?

513
00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:17,375
Don't worry.

514
00:27:17,375 --> 00:27:20,708
I see you've completely taken over Nezha's body.

515
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:21,833
Let's go again.

516
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:26,125
This time, I won't hold back.

517
00:27:26,125 --> 00:27:29,041
You'd better give it your all, too.

518
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:41,000
I humbly seek your guidance.

519
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,750
Not bad.

520
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,541
You're barely able to match my skills.

521
00:27:44,541 --> 00:27:45,208
Master Taiyi,

522
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:46,333
your nose is bleeding.

523
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:48,583
Oh, it's been too hot recently.

524
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:49,500
I need more water.

525
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,583
No big deal.

526
00:27:58,458 --> 00:28:01,375
Kunlun Mountain! We're here.

527
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:02,458
I heard that a day here

528
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:03,833
is the same as a year in the mortal world.

529
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:04,708
Don't worry.

530
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:06,125
We're not in the celestial realm yet.

531
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:07,125
But all these people?

532
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:08,750
They've all come to seek immortality.

533
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,625
The Chan sect is famous across the world,

534
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:12,375
and everyone wants to join.

535
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:13,833
Look at this.

536
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:14,958
The jasper.

537
00:28:14,958 --> 00:28:16,708
It's a credential of a Chan Sect immortal.

538
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:17,708
With it,

539
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:19,958
you'll receive respect everywhere you go.

540
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:20,708
I'm telling ya.

541
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:22,583
Being an immortal is amazing.

542
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:23,833
Both of your brothers have ascended.

543
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:25,000
You'll have no problem either.

544
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,875
I mean Nezha's brothers.

545
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:27,958
His two brothers

546
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:30,500
are among the best of the third generation disciples.

547
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,500
You know how...

548
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,958
Nezha always misbehaves, right?

549
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:36,041
That's why I often tell stories about his brothers

550
00:28:36,041 --> 00:28:37,708
to serve as a good example for him.

551
00:28:37,708 --> 00:28:38,958
Let me tell you something,

552
00:28:38,958 --> 00:28:40,916
Nezha idolizes his brothers.

553
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:04,708
Oh wow, you're lucky

554
00:29:04,708 --> 00:29:07,041
to see the famous Demon Hunters.

555
00:29:07,041 --> 00:29:08,375
Demon Hunters?

556
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:09,916
They roam the land, hunting down

557
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:11,375
demons that wreak havoc on humanity,

558
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,750
keeping the world at peace.

559
00:29:14,125 --> 00:29:15,958
The current leader of the Demon Hunters

560
00:29:15,958 --> 00:29:18,375
is the top disciple of Immortal Wuliang.

561
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:21,291
Wasn't his predecessor Shen Gongbao?

562
00:29:32,916 --> 00:29:35,666
[Yu Xu Palace]

563
00:29:35,666 --> 00:29:36,416
Master Taiyi,

564
00:29:36,416 --> 00:29:37,875
what's that smoke over there?

565
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:38,666
Oh.

566
00:29:38,666 --> 00:29:41,041
That's the most precious treasure of Yu Xu Palace.

567
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:43,166
The Tianyuan Cauldron.

568
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:51,833
Brother Taiyi.

569
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:52,458
[Immortal Wuliang]
Brother Taiyi.

570
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,500
[Immortal Wuliang]
It been so long!

571
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,291
[Immortal Wuliang]

572
00:29:55,291 --> 00:29:56,625
Brother Wuliang!

573
00:29:56,625 --> 00:29:58,291
I heard that during Master's seclusion,

574
00:29:58,291 --> 00:30:00,000
you've been in charge of Yu Xu Palace.

575
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,541
I've brought my disciple to attempt the Ascension Trial.

576
00:30:02,541 --> 00:30:03,125
Nezha,

577
00:30:03,125 --> 00:30:04,958
Pay respect to Master Wuliang.

578
00:30:04,958 --> 00:30:06,125
Master Wuliang.

579
00:30:06,125 --> 00:30:07,625
So, you're Nezha?

580
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:09,666
The reincarnation of the Spirit Pearl?

581
00:30:09,666 --> 00:30:11,291
Oh my!

582
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:13,000
How remarkable!

583
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,291
The Supreme Lord has great expectations for you.

584
00:30:17,291 --> 00:30:18,666
And you sure don't disappoint.

585
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:19,833
Look at him.

586
00:30:19,833 --> 00:30:22,041
So full of robust vitality,

587
00:30:22,041 --> 00:30:24,000
giving off a righteous vibe.

588
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:34,250
The boy's been over-training lately.

589
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,833
His state is a bit unstable.

590
00:30:38,916 --> 00:30:40,541
What do you think you're doing?

591
00:30:40,541 --> 00:30:42,000
This is Yu Xu Palace!

592
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,458
I need to pee!

593
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:44,708
Crana!

594
00:30:44,708 --> 00:30:45,416
Here!

595
00:30:45,416 --> 00:30:47,958
[Crana]
Take the child to the restroom.

596
00:30:47,958 --> 00:30:48,916
Restroom?

597
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:50,166
I didn't say anything about resting.

598
00:30:50,166 --> 00:30:51,291
Idiot!

599
00:30:51,875 --> 00:30:52,833
Restroom

600
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:55,416
is where you pee.

601
00:30:56,291 --> 00:30:57,833
The boy's a bit rough.

602
00:30:57,833 --> 00:30:58,791
Please forgive him.

603
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,500
Wow!

604
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,291
So white!

605
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:10,666
Wow!

606
00:31:10,666 --> 00:31:12,125
So white!

607
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,041
Wow!

608
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:15,125
So white!

609
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:18,083
Is the entire palace made of jade?

610
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:20,125
Where did they get so much money to buy jade?

611
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:22,458
The "Yu" in Yu Xu Palace means jade, right?

612
00:31:22,458 --> 00:31:24,125
Then what does the "Xu" mean?

613
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:25,041
Humble?

614
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:25,916
Guilty?

615
00:31:25,916 --> 00:31:26,791
Or emptiness?

616
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:29,625
Is the restroom also made of jade?

617
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:31,083
Even immortals need to pee, don't they?

618
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:34,000
Does Immortal Wuliang also poop?

619
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:36,416
This is a place of cultivation.

620
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:37,375
Lower your voice.

621
00:31:38,458 --> 00:31:39,916
How much further is the toilet?

622
00:31:39,916 --> 00:31:40,833
I can't hold it anymore.

623
00:31:40,833 --> 00:31:41,916
Hey, sister, wait for me!

624
00:31:43,666 --> 00:31:44,125
You!

625
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,875
I didn't mean it.

626
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,250
I need to change my skirt.

627
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,375
Go by yourself.

628
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:51,000
But I don't know where the toilet is.

629
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Go through the corridor, turn right, then left.

630
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Oh.

631
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,375
Wow.

632
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:12,166
It's so fancy!

633
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:15,083
Radical!

634
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:39,458
Weird.

635
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:40,791
Am I lost?

636
00:32:41,916 --> 00:32:43,416
Where are you going?

637
00:32:43,416 --> 00:32:43,916
Oh.

638
00:32:43,916 --> 00:32:44,541
I got lost.

639
00:32:45,875 --> 00:32:46,750
Follow me.

640
00:32:48,416 --> 00:32:51,125
Brother, you've done a good job raising the Spirit Pearl.

641
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:54,916
Another great achievement for the Sect.

642
00:32:54,916 --> 00:32:55,708
Not at all.

643
00:32:55,708 --> 00:32:57,916
It's all thanks to Master's guidance.

644
00:32:57,916 --> 00:33:01,291
This Kunlun Dew is a rare elixir.

645
00:33:01,291 --> 00:33:04,083
Normally, it takes six months to fill a basin.

646
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:05,791
But today, when I sent someone to check,

647
00:33:05,791 --> 00:33:07,291
it was already full!

648
00:33:08,291 --> 00:33:10,833
Your timing couldn't be better.

649
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:12,291
Brother,

650
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:15,041
luck sure favors you, doesn't it?

651
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:19,666
What's wrong with you?

652
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:21,375
Can't even drink water properly.

653
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:23,000
My disciple is a bit crude.

654
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Please forgive him.

655
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:27,125
My pee is in the water.

656
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,041
My master is a bit crude, too.

657
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:33,916
Please forgive him.

658
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:35,291
Brother,

659
00:33:35,291 --> 00:33:36,375
time is of the essence.

660
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:38,875
I think Nezha should go through the trial immediately.

661
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:40,208
Why the rush?

662
00:33:40,208 --> 00:33:42,208
Let's finish our drinks first.

663
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:43,083
No, no thank you.

664
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,708
Alright, then.

665
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:49,583
My disciple Deero will be the judge.

666
00:33:49,583 --> 00:33:51,083
The next target of the Demon Hunters

667
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:53,041
can be captured by Nezha.

668
00:33:53,041 --> 00:33:54,333
Brother, excuse us.

669
00:33:58,125 --> 00:33:59,333
Taiyi, my brother,

670
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:01,166
always so impatient.

671
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:08,125
The taste of the Dew this year

672
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:12,958
is especially rich.

673
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:15,791
Keep using this method in the future.

674
00:34:15,791 --> 00:34:17,958
Yes, master.

675
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:00,166
Why have you stopped?

676
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:01,791
It's been six hours,

677
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:02,666
Master Shen.

678
00:35:02,666 --> 00:35:03,833
We're too tired to continue.

679
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:04,416
Rubbish!

680
00:35:04,416 --> 00:35:06,541
Cultivation allows no laziness.

681
00:35:06,541 --> 00:35:08,083
Without my permission

682
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:09,458
you do not stop!

683
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:18,291
General Li Jing of Chentang Pass is here to see you.

684
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:19,458
Master Shen,

685
00:35:19,458 --> 00:35:20,458
yesterday's battle

686
00:35:20,458 --> 00:35:22,750
left many soldiers and civilians of Chentang Pass injured.

687
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,041
We've run out of medicine.

688
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:27,333
I humbly ask you to open a path

689
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:30,125
so that a few doctors can leave the city to buy supplies.

690
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:36,291
How bold!

691
00:35:36,291 --> 00:35:37,291
No wonder you're...

692
00:35:37,791 --> 00:35:38,875
Who did that?

693
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:40,458
You son of a...

694
00:35:40,666 --> 00:35:41,500
I...

695
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,083
St... stop, stop, stop!

696
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:53,125
Bring me the one

697
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:54,791
you caught earlier.

698
00:35:54,791 --> 00:35:57,541
He escaped the city during the battle.

699
00:35:57,541 --> 00:35:59,125
General Li, please,

700
00:35:59,125 --> 00:36:01,500
take him ba... back with you.

701
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,291
This is a misunderstanding, Master Shen!

702
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:04,625
I'm a demon too!

703
00:36:04,625 --> 00:36:06,291
I captured this Yaksha

704
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:08,708
to clear my son's name.

705
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,125
Now that it's settled,

706
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:12,625
and since he hasn't done anything worse,

707
00:36:12,625 --> 00:36:13,791
just let him go.

708
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:15,208
Yes, exactly.

709
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:16,333
I'm a nobody.

710
00:36:16,333 --> 00:36:17,958
Insignificant.

711
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:20,916
I don't think you understood me.

712
00:36:20,916 --> 00:36:24,458
No one leaves here, not even a demon.

713
00:36:24,458 --> 00:36:25,791
Let alone humans.

714
00:36:26,666 --> 00:36:28,375
Master Shen, please have mercy.

715
00:36:28,375 --> 00:36:30,875
I'm a demon, too.

716
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:32,875
We are both villains!

717
00:36:32,875 --> 00:36:33,500
Pfft!

718
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,250
I'm n... not a villain.

719
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:37,166
Everyone who knows the secret of the Spirit Pearl

720
00:36:37,166 --> 00:36:38,125
must stay here.

721
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:39,541
Without medicine,

722
00:36:39,541 --> 00:36:42,166
the injured won't survive.

723
00:36:44,291 --> 00:36:46,916
Master Shen, please,

724
00:36:46,916 --> 00:36:48,500
I'm only asking to save lives.

725
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:50,958
Sir!

726
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,166
We caught a spy.

727
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:53,583
This creature came from outside the city,

728
00:36:53,583 --> 00:36:55,083
and injured some of our soldiers.

729
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:56,625
Lock... lock him up too.

730
00:36:56,625 --> 00:36:58,041
Brother.

731
00:36:58,041 --> 00:36:59,166
Brother, is that you?

732
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:00,916
You...

733
00:37:00,916 --> 00:37:02,000
Brother, it's me!

734
00:37:03,416 --> 00:37:05,791
[Shen Xiaobao]

735
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:07,541
Xiaobao?

736
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:11,083
You haven't been home for centuries.

737
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:12,375
I missed you so much.

738
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,333
What are you doing here?

739
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:15,708
Father sent me to find you.

740
00:37:15,708 --> 00:37:16,333
Look,

741
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:17,666
the compass you gave me.

742
00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:19,166
It tells me where you are.

743
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,750
Father,

744
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,750
how is he doing?

745
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:24,625
He's great.

746
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:26,416
Ever since you entered Yu Xu Palace,

747
00:37:26,416 --> 00:37:28,166
father's been full of energy,

748
00:37:28,166 --> 00:37:29,666
like he took some miracle tonic.

749
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:31,375
You are the only one from our village to ever

750
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:33,291
to make it as a Chan Sect immortal.

751
00:37:33,291 --> 00:37:34,583
Now, demons from miles around

752
00:37:34,583 --> 00:37:36,333
are pouring in to train with father.

753
00:37:38,416 --> 00:37:39,333
By the way,

754
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,250
why are you here?

755
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,916
Didn't you promise me before,

756
00:37:43,916 --> 00:37:45,250
once I had achieved human form,

757
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:47,291
you'd get me into Yu Xu Palace?

758
00:37:47,291 --> 00:37:48,875
Look!
I can turn into a human now!

759
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:57,041
All these years, I've trained so hard,

760
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:59,041
and never slacked off.

761
00:37:59,041 --> 00:38:00,708
You're my role model, big brother.

762
00:38:00,708 --> 00:38:03,041
Glory to Yu Xu, answering heaven's call.

763
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:07,458
Travel the world, bringing justice to all.

764
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:10,625
Say, brother,

765
00:38:10,625 --> 00:38:11,583
what are you doing here?

766
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:13,458
I... I...

767
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,291
Are these sea monsters your subordinates?

768
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:17,291
Why are you surrounding Chentang Pass?

769
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:18,375
Well, about that...

770
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:20,458
Th... this is...

771
00:38:20,458 --> 00:38:22,791
Master Shen is defending Chentang Pass.

772
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:24,458
Huh?

773
00:38:24,458 --> 00:38:26,083
Evil forces invaded the city.

774
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:29,625
Master Shen and the sea clan came to our aid.

775
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:33,166
On behalf of my people,
thank you for this noble act.

776
00:38:35,291 --> 00:38:37,250
Don't mention it.

777
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,125
Wow!

778
00:38:39,125 --> 00:38:41,291
Brother, you're incredible!

779
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:43,458
Is this the demon attacking Chentang Pass?

780
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:45,916
Ah!

781
00:38:45,916 --> 00:38:48,125
You are a disgrace to all demons!

782
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:48,958
Shame on you!

783
00:38:49,916 --> 00:38:50,791
Hey,

784
00:38:50,791 --> 00:38:52,166
Xiaobao,

785
00:38:52,166 --> 00:38:53,458
can you

786
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:56,000
wait a few more years

787
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,500
before going to Yu Xu Palace?

788
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,333
Huh?

789
00:38:58,333 --> 00:38:59,666
Why?

790
00:38:59,666 --> 00:39:01,625
I can transform into a human now!

791
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:03,541
It's just that...

792
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:06,416
I'm preparing for my promotion to the Twelve Golden Immortals,

793
00:39:06,416 --> 00:39:07,458
so I can't be distracted.

794
00:39:07,458 --> 00:39:09,041
Twelve Golden Immortals?

795
00:39:09,041 --> 00:39:10,833
Once it's done,

796
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:11,791
I'll take you there,

797
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:13,458
okay?

798
00:39:16,666 --> 00:39:17,500
No problem, brother!

799
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,833
Your promotion is more important.

800
00:39:18,833 --> 00:39:21,000
I can go to Yu Xu Palace anytime.

801
00:39:21,958 --> 00:39:23,666
Besides,

802
00:39:23,666 --> 00:39:25,875
I haven't quite mastered the shape-shifting.

803
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:27,625
I'll go back and practice some more.

804
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:28,666
Practice more.

805
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:32,833
Xiaobao,

806
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:35,458
this is what I have saved up since entering the Palace.

807
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:36,708
What is it?

808
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:39,708
Yu Xu Palace gives all disciples these immortality pills.

809
00:39:39,708 --> 00:39:40,625
Take one

810
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:42,458
and you ga... gain ten years' worth of cultivation.

811
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:43,833
But...

812
00:39:43,833 --> 00:39:45,083
this is too precious.

813
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:46,791
Brother, you're training for a promotion.

814
00:39:46,791 --> 00:39:48,291
You should keep them.

815
00:39:48,291 --> 00:39:49,625
I don't like how they taste.

816
00:39:49,625 --> 00:39:51,625
I prefer cultivating my own.

817
00:39:51,625 --> 00:39:52,833
You... you take them back.

818
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:53,833
Share them with the family.

819
00:39:55,208 --> 00:39:55,750
No, I can't.

820
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:56,958
Father will blame me.

821
00:39:56,958 --> 00:39:57,750
Xiaobao,

822
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,333
are you not obeying your big brother?

823
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:00,625
Take the pills and leave now.

824
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:02,250
This is the front line.

825
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:03,500
If... if you stay,

826
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,750
I'll be distracted.

827
00:40:05,125 --> 00:40:06,666
Then...

828
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:08,458
I...

829
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:09,750
I'll leave.

830
00:40:13,458 --> 00:40:14,416
Brother.

831
00:40:14,416 --> 00:40:16,666
You must make it into the Twelve Golden Immortals.

832
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:20,541
I'll keep training!

833
00:40:25,833 --> 00:40:27,375
I appreciate your help,

834
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:28,583
but the stakes are too high

835
00:40:28,583 --> 00:40:30,125
for me to let anyone through.

836
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:31,166
This Yaksha...

837
00:40:31,166 --> 00:40:33,041
you... you take him back, too.

838
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:34,416
I wasn't helping you.

839
00:40:34,416 --> 00:40:36,083
I was helping the young one.

840
00:40:36,625 --> 00:40:38,708
A good role model

841
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:41,125
can change his life.

842
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:43,625
Wait.

843
00:40:45,916 --> 00:40:47,958
Le... leave me a list of medicines you need.

844
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:57,541
[Level 1: Bandits Hill]

845
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:33,041
I am Nezha, the Third Prince bold.

846
00:41:33,041 --> 00:41:35,958
I slay the demons, I write in rhyme untold.

847
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:38,833
Today I come to rid the evil's breath.

848
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:42,833
You wicked fiends, prepare for death!

849
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:47,541
Still eating?

850
00:41:47,541 --> 00:41:49,541
You are doomed!

851
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:53,708
Ahhh!

852
00:41:54,583 --> 00:41:58,000
Who do you think you are?

853
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,583
Barging into our Bandits Hill?

854
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:03,166
So you're in charge?

855
00:42:03,166 --> 00:42:03,916
Come forward

856
00:42:03,916 --> 00:42:05,250
and have a taste of my power.

857
00:42:06,375 --> 00:42:08,250
You arrogant spoiled brat.

858
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,041
Boss,

859
00:42:09,041 --> 00:42:10,791
teach him a lesson.

860
00:42:29,208 --> 00:42:30,500
Show me what you got.

861
00:42:32,291 --> 00:42:33,500
You go.

862
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,416
No, but, boss...

863
00:42:35,416 --> 00:42:37,458
how dare I steal your thunder?

864
00:42:37,458 --> 00:42:39,750
Fighting a child is just embarrassing.

865
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,833
When I say go, you go.

866
00:42:41,833 --> 00:42:43,166
Hey, k-k-kid.

867
00:42:43,166 --> 00:42:44,875
Since you're young and naive,

868
00:42:44,875 --> 00:42:46,333
I'm willing to let this slide.

869
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:47,708
You, you...

870
00:42:47,708 --> 00:42:49,958
It's still not too late to run home to mommy.

871
00:42:50,583 --> 00:42:51,208
What's wrong?

872
00:42:51,208 --> 00:42:52,291
Why are you awake again?

873
00:42:52,291 --> 00:42:52,958
I don't know.

874
00:42:52,958 --> 00:42:53,958
I'm a light sleeper.

875
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:55,708
All that shaking has jolted me awake.

876
00:42:56,416 --> 00:42:57,375
Darn it.

877
00:42:57,416 --> 00:42:58,791
He took too much of that pill

878
00:42:58,791 --> 00:42:59,875
and now he's immune.

879
00:43:00,041 --> 00:43:01,125
Increase the dose then.

880
00:43:01,291 --> 00:43:05,041
If you insist to stay, you might get hurt.

881
00:43:08,958 --> 00:43:10,291
I was going to dodge to the right.

882
00:43:10,291 --> 00:43:11,708
Sorry, I thought it was left.

883
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:15,875
So weak.

884
00:43:15,875 --> 00:43:16,583
Master Taiyi.

885
00:43:16,583 --> 00:43:17,916
Maybe I should cut in.

886
00:43:17,916 --> 00:43:19,291
He could use a few more years' training.

887
00:43:19,291 --> 00:43:20,458
Not so fast.

888
00:43:20,458 --> 00:43:22,500
He was just teasing the demon.

889
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,416
The boy likes to...

890
00:43:23,416 --> 00:43:24,416
play dumb.

891
00:43:25,291 --> 00:43:27,291
Pills.

892
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:28,125
I need pills.

893
00:43:28,125 --> 00:43:30,458
I gave you a warning.

894
00:43:30,458 --> 00:43:33,166
Now you know who you're messing with.

895
00:43:33,166 --> 00:43:33,625
Oh no!

896
00:43:33,625 --> 00:43:35,291
The pills have dissolved in the soup!

897
00:43:35,958 --> 00:43:37,958
Then I'll drink the soup.

898
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,875
And you're trying to steal our soup?

899
00:43:41,875 --> 00:43:43,291
This calls for a beating.

900
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:49,875
So gross.

901
00:43:49,875 --> 00:43:53,583
Super Mighty Club Strike!

902
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:58,458
See!

903
00:43:58,458 --> 00:43:59,750
I told you he was pretending.

904
00:44:00,416 --> 00:44:02,291
I wasn't paying attention.

905
00:44:02,291 --> 00:44:03,000
Impossible!

906
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:22,958
Impossible!

907
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:30,708
You suck!

908
00:44:30,708 --> 00:44:31,791
Step aside!

909
00:44:31,791 --> 00:44:32,875
Watch me kick his butt.

910
00:44:33,458 --> 00:44:34,625
Why did you spit it all out?

911
00:44:34,625 --> 00:44:35,750
The taste is too strong.

912
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:36,666
I couldn't help it.

913
00:44:36,666 --> 00:44:38,125
Check this out!

914
00:44:41,375 --> 00:44:42,583
Funny!

915
00:44:42,791 --> 00:44:43,625
This isn't working.

916
00:44:43,625 --> 00:44:45,083
We can't win without the pill.

917
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:54,916
Deero is watching.

918
00:44:54,916 --> 00:44:56,333
I can't give you the pill.

919
00:44:56,333 --> 00:44:57,625
What do we do now?

920
00:44:57,625 --> 00:44:59,125
I got it.

921
00:44:59,125 --> 00:45:01,625
There is another way.

922
00:45:01,625 --> 00:45:02,791
You're not suggesting...

923
00:45:02,791 --> 00:45:04,958
We can eat the puke.

924
00:45:04,958 --> 00:45:05,625
But,

925
00:45:05,625 --> 00:45:07,125
it's disgusting.

926
00:45:08,125 --> 00:45:09,041
What's the big deal?

927
00:45:09,041 --> 00:45:10,583
I've drank Yaksha booger before.

928
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,291
That explains a lot.

929
00:45:13,291 --> 00:45:15,000
No pain,

930
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,083
no gain.

931
00:45:17,083 --> 00:45:19,625
That's how Nezha defeats fate.

932
00:45:20,625 --> 00:45:23,500
The lives of my parents and friends are at stake,

933
00:45:24,625 --> 00:45:27,291
and the people of Chentang Pass too.

934
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:31,375
This is E-A-S-Y P-E-A-S-Y!

935
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:41,458
Ignoring prejudice,

936
00:45:41,458 --> 00:45:43,625
and overcoming inner fears,

937
00:45:43,625 --> 00:45:46,291
I will change my destiny.

938
00:46:05,458 --> 00:46:07,708
I've kept a low profile

939
00:46:07,708 --> 00:46:09,750
until today's show.

940
00:46:10,125 --> 00:46:11,375
Master Taiyi...

941
00:46:11,375 --> 00:46:12,666
I'll save Nezha first.

942
00:46:12,666 --> 00:46:14,458
Then we'll figure out a way to get Elixir Reparo.

943
00:46:14,458 --> 00:46:15,916
No way.

944
00:46:15,916 --> 00:46:16,958
I don't believe this.

945
00:46:17,166 --> 00:46:17,875
Kid,

946
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:19,250
let's go another round.

947
00:46:20,708 --> 00:46:21,750
Fake death?

948
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:24,416
I'll smash you!

949
00:46:31,791 --> 00:46:33,250
Good thing Nezha got knocked out.

950
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:37,166
You do suck!

951
00:46:38,375 --> 00:46:39,875
Let me avenge you!

952
00:46:39,875 --> 00:46:43,375
Invincible Whirlwind Punch!

953
00:46:57,875 --> 00:46:59,208
Ahhh!

954
00:47:17,541 --> 00:47:18,625
Do we have to catch them all?

955
00:47:18,625 --> 00:47:19,833
Even leaving one behind

956
00:47:19,833 --> 00:47:21,625
could harm the people here.

957
00:47:21,625 --> 00:47:22,958
Take them all back to Yu Xu Palace.

958
00:47:22,958 --> 00:47:24,958
The Sect will guide them to the right path,

959
00:47:24,958 --> 00:47:26,250
turning evil to good.

960
00:47:27,083 --> 00:47:28,416
Your face...

961
00:47:28,416 --> 00:47:29,458
No biggie.

962
00:47:29,458 --> 00:47:31,291
He's sometimes ugly, sometimes handsome.

963
00:47:31,291 --> 00:47:32,125
Spirit Pearl, you know,

964
00:47:32,125 --> 00:47:33,708
not like normal people.

965
00:47:34,958 --> 00:47:36,291
Be more careful next time.

966
00:47:36,625 --> 00:47:38,625
You scared my soul out.

967
00:47:51,125 --> 00:47:52,041
Who's this kid?

968
00:47:52,041 --> 00:47:53,166
Nezha, possibly.

969
00:47:53,166 --> 00:47:54,291
Jinzha and Muzha's younger brother.

970
00:47:54,291 --> 00:47:56,833
He's the Spirit Pearl reincarnation appointed by the Supreme Lord.

971
00:47:59,708 --> 00:48:02,208
But his looks aren't much, huh?

972
00:48:02,208 --> 00:48:03,833
Hunched back.

973
00:48:03,833 --> 00:48:05,083
Wobbly pace.

974
00:48:05,083 --> 00:48:06,333
Sinking brows and drooping eyes.

975
00:48:06,333 --> 00:48:07,375
Rude face.

976
00:48:07,375 --> 00:48:08,541
Not to mention the dark eye circles.

977
00:48:08,541 --> 00:48:10,291
He's like a ghost.

978
00:48:17,416 --> 00:48:18,791
Don't stir up trouble now.

979
00:48:26,958 --> 00:48:28,333
Brother,

980
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:29,875
Six stars in alignment,

981
00:48:28,333 --> 00:48:31,166
what's the star sign tonight?

982
00:48:29,875 --> 00:48:31,583
once in a decade.

983
00:48:31,583 --> 00:48:33,583
Whenever six stars align,

984
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:37,791
this Jade Podium can transmit sound and images across thousands of miles.

985
00:48:37,791 --> 00:48:40,000
Though our brothers are scattered all over the world,

986
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,958
we can finally gather together.

987
00:48:41,958 --> 00:48:45,208
Tonight is the night,

988
00:48:45,208 --> 00:48:47,750
the Golden Immortals shall meet.

989
00:48:48,583 --> 00:48:50,375
I haven't ascended to the Twelve yet.

990
00:48:50,624 --> 00:48:51,874
Maybe I shouldn't be included.

991
00:48:52,415 --> 00:48:54,457
It's only a matter of time.

992
00:48:54,457 --> 00:48:55,540
No la, no la.

993
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:58,665
It's not appropriate at all.

994
00:48:58,665 --> 00:49:00,165
I can't do it, really.

995
00:49:01,249 --> 00:49:02,624
Then why are you sitting up there?

996
00:49:02,624 --> 00:49:03,290
Shut up!

997
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:04,832
Would it kill you to see your master thrive?

998
00:49:14,374 --> 00:49:15,707
A sauna!

999
00:49:15,874 --> 00:49:17,040
Shh!

1000
00:49:23,874 --> 00:49:26,707
Brothers and sisters, I humbly welcome you back to your places.

1001
00:49:26,707 --> 00:49:29,165
Greetings, Brother Wuliang!

1002
00:49:29,165 --> 00:49:32,040
Allow me to introduce a new member.

1003
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,874
Brother Taiyi.

1004
00:49:33,874 --> 00:49:36,415
He has fulfilled the master's expectations.

1005
00:49:36,415 --> 00:49:38,207
and successfully nurtured

1006
00:49:38,207 --> 00:49:39,874
the Spirit Pearl reincarnated.

1007
00:49:41,874 --> 00:49:43,874
Pay your respect.

1008
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:49,040
The Deification War is imminent.

1009
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:53,790
We are here to discuss the preparation.

1010
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:56,207
[Immortal Guangcheng]
Chan Sect is the orthodox of Tao,

1011
00:49:56,207 --> 00:49:57,124
[Immortal Guangcheng]
so we're destined to win.

1012
00:49:57,124 --> 00:49:57,874
so we're destined to win.

1013
00:49:57,874 --> 00:50:00,040
[Immortal Chijing]
But as Jie Sect has risen rapidly these years,

1014
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,207
[Immortal Chijing]
we must remain vigilant.

1015
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:02,624
[Immortal Ju Liu Sun]

1016
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:03,374
[Immortal Ju Liu Sun]
Jie sect,

1017
00:50:03,374 --> 00:50:04,999
[Immortal Ju Liu Sun]
is where furry and horned beasts gather

1018
00:50:04,999 --> 00:50:05,624
is where furry and horned beasts gather

1019
00:50:05,624 --> 00:50:07,457
and creatures born of mucus and eggs.

1020
00:50:07,457 --> 00:50:09,415
This war concerns the survival of our sect.

1021
00:50:09,415 --> 00:50:09,957
[Immortal Huanglong]
We must be careful.

1022
00:50:09,957 --> 00:50:11,165
[Immortal Huanglong]
We must be careful.

1023
00:50:11,165 --> 00:50:13,040
[Immortal Huanglong]
Strengthening our power

1024
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:13,249
[Immortal Huanglong]
is the key.

1025
00:50:13,249 --> 00:50:14,332
[Immortal Huanglong]
is the key.

1026
00:50:14,332 --> 00:50:16,082
Precisely,

1027
00:50:16,082 --> 00:50:20,374
That's why I began preparing early.

1028
00:50:20,374 --> 00:50:21,540
Immortality pills,

1029
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:23,374
a total of nine thousand,

1030
00:50:23,374 --> 00:50:27,207
could be allocated according to merit.

1031
00:50:27,207 --> 00:50:29,999
This will definitely boost our strength.

1032
00:50:29,999 --> 00:50:31,124
[Immortal Daoheng]
How are there so many?

1033
00:50:31,124 --> 00:50:31,165
[Immortal Daoheng]
How are there so many?

1034
00:50:31,165 --> 00:50:32,332
For a hundred years,

1035
00:50:32,332 --> 00:50:35,082
our master has tirelessly refined pills using the Tianyuan Cauldron,

1036
00:50:35,082 --> 00:50:36,624
working day and night,

1037
00:50:36,624 --> 00:50:38,540
at the cost of his own cultivation.

1038
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:42,332
[Immortal Lingbao]
Brother Wuliang has dedicated himself to building our sect,

1039
00:50:42,332 --> 00:50:44,415
his contributions are to be praised.

1040
00:50:46,915 --> 00:50:46,957
Aye, aye.

1041
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:47,374
[Immortal Cihang]
Besides the Jie Sect,

1042
00:50:47,374 --> 00:50:48,582
[Immortal Cihang]
Besides the Jie Sect,

1043
00:50:48,582 --> 00:50:50,790
[Immortal Cihang]
are there other evil forces plotting against us?

1044
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:50,915
[Immortal Cihang]
are there other evil forces plotting against us?

1045
00:50:50,915 --> 00:50:51,999
Master Cihang,

1046
00:50:51,999 --> 00:50:53,707
as soon as menacing demons are discovered,

1047
00:50:53,707 --> 00:50:55,332
the Demon Hunters will immediately be sent out.

1048
00:50:55,332 --> 00:50:58,124
So, most stray demons pose no threat.

1049
00:50:58,124 --> 00:50:58,874
But,

1050
00:50:58,874 --> 00:51:00,290
there is one exception.

1051
00:51:00,499 --> 00:51:01,415
[Immortal Yuding]
Oh?

1052
00:51:01,415 --> 00:51:02,332
[Immortal Yuding]
Who is that?

1053
00:51:02,874 --> 00:51:04,332
The Eastern Sea dragons.

1054
00:51:04,665 --> 00:51:07,332
Dragons?

1055
00:51:07,332 --> 00:51:10,207
[Immortal Qingxu]
Didn't they surrender to the Court of Heaven long ago?

1056
00:51:10,624 --> 00:51:12,624
We can't trust any but our own kind

1057
00:51:12,624 --> 00:51:13,707
To me,

1058
00:51:13,707 --> 00:51:16,249
their surrender is merely a facade,

1059
00:51:16,249 --> 00:51:17,290
hibernating for a moment.

1060
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:20,499
The dragons have helped subdue the abyss monsters for thousands of years.

1061
00:51:20,499 --> 00:51:22,165
What's their crime?

1062
00:51:22,165 --> 00:51:24,040
They have great strength.

1063
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,707
If they betray us in the war,

1064
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:28,082
the whole situation could be reversed.

1065
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:31,374
But we still can't attack them.

1066
00:51:31,374 --> 00:51:33,749
[Immortal Wenshu]
Our reputation of righteousness and justice is known to all.

1067
00:51:33,749 --> 00:51:34,707
[Immortal Wenshu]
Our reputation of righteousness and justice is known to all.

1068
00:51:34,707 --> 00:51:36,207
[Immortal Wenshu]
If we gratuitously

1069
00:51:36,207 --> 00:51:37,040
[Immortal Wenshu]
attack the surrendered,

1070
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,040
[Immortal Wenshu]
attack the surrendered,

1071
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:41,207
How will anyone ever trust us?

1072
00:51:41,207 --> 00:51:42,874
Aye.

1073
00:51:42,874 --> 00:51:44,457
We must not act rashly.

1074
00:51:44,457 --> 00:51:47,499
Further deliberation is necessary.

1075
00:51:47,499 --> 00:51:48,040
But...

1076
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,374
Enough.

1077
00:51:49,374 --> 00:51:51,040
The point has been made.

1078
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,040
And you don't have to be bigoted.

1079
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,207
OK.

1080
00:51:54,207 --> 00:51:56,665
The time of the six-star alignment is almost over.

1081
00:51:56,665 --> 00:51:59,832
Since there are no other topics,

1082
00:51:59,832 --> 00:52:02,124
let's adjourn the meeting.

1083
00:52:02,124 --> 00:52:03,207
Brother,

1084
00:52:03,207 --> 00:52:04,207
Jinzha and Muzha,

1085
00:52:04,207 --> 00:52:07,124
are disciples of myself and Brother Puxian.

1086
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:10,207
They have been cultivating here for many years away from home,

1087
00:52:10,207 --> 00:52:11,790
and have never even met Nezha,

1088
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:13,290
their younger brother.

1089
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:16,165
[Immortal Puxian]
Since there's still time left in the six-star alignment,

1090
00:52:16,165 --> 00:52:17,082
[Immortal Puxian]
why not let them

1091
00:52:17,082 --> 00:52:17,582
[Immortal Puxian]
why not let them

1092
00:52:17,582 --> 00:52:19,874
[Immortal Puxian]
meet for awhile?

1093
00:52:21,165 --> 00:52:22,624
Great idea.

1094
00:52:29,124 --> 00:52:30,374
Oh no!

1095
00:52:30,374 --> 00:52:32,540
What should I do?

1096
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:34,207
What's wrong?

1097
00:52:34,624 --> 00:52:35,915
Look at me...

1098
00:52:35,915 --> 00:52:37,540
Will my first impression...

1099
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:39,249
be bad?

1100
00:52:39,249 --> 00:52:40,290
Of course not!

1101
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:40,999
Really?

1102
00:52:40,999 --> 00:52:42,082
Though slovenly,

1103
00:52:42,082 --> 00:52:43,082
you've got strong will.

1104
00:52:43,082 --> 00:52:43,915
Though short,

1105
00:52:43,915 --> 00:52:45,124
you've got a big heart.

1106
00:52:45,124 --> 00:52:46,207
Though ugly,

1107
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,249
you're kind inside.

1108
00:52:47,249 --> 00:52:48,207
Though you have black eye circles,

1109
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:48,874
a piggy nose,

1110
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:49,707
and a missing tooth,

1111
00:52:49,707 --> 00:52:50,374
I still think

1112
00:52:50,374 --> 00:52:52,374
you're truly incredibly great.

1113
00:52:52,374 --> 00:52:55,582
And I'm sure your brothers will agree.

1114
00:52:56,832 --> 00:52:58,540
Thanks for the compliment.

1115
00:52:59,999 --> 00:53:00,665
What are you doing?

1116
00:53:00,665 --> 00:53:01,874
You go meet my brothers for me.

1117
00:53:01,874 --> 00:53:03,290
Seriously?

1118
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:04,374
How can I do that for you?

1119
00:53:04,374 --> 00:53:05,415
No, Nezha.

1120
00:53:05,415 --> 00:53:06,415
Nezha!

1121
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:14,290
The boy is a bit shy.

1122
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:20,874
Nezha!

1123
00:53:21,374 --> 00:53:22,332
Brother!

1124
00:53:48,624 --> 00:53:49,957
Ao Bing,

1125
00:53:49,957 --> 00:53:51,540
you cried?

1126
00:53:52,832 --> 00:53:55,040
This reminded me of my two brothers.

1127
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,374
You have brothers too?

1128
00:53:56,874 --> 00:53:57,624
Mmm hmm.

1129
00:53:57,999 --> 00:53:59,082
I used to.

1130
00:54:00,332 --> 00:54:02,290
You're so lucky

1131
00:54:02,290 --> 00:54:02,999
to have two such wonderful brothers.

1132
00:54:04,499 --> 00:54:06,874
What were you talking about just now?

1133
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:09,040
They said

1134
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,165
they're sorry for not checking on you all these years.

1135
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:12,999
They asked

1136
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,707
how things have been at home,

1137
00:54:15,707 --> 00:54:16,874
if your parents are well,

1138
00:54:16,874 --> 00:54:17,874
what hobbies you have,

1139
00:54:17,874 --> 00:54:19,707
and who your friends are.

1140
00:54:19,707 --> 00:54:21,207
They also said

1141
00:54:21,207 --> 00:54:24,499
whatever problems you may have in the future, you must tell them.

1142
00:54:24,499 --> 00:54:26,165
And remember, you have two brothers

1143
00:54:26,874 --> 00:54:29,040
who will always, always help and protect you.

1144
00:54:30,665 --> 00:54:31,290
Why are you...

1145
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:32,124
Nothing.

1146
00:54:32,124 --> 00:54:33,707
It's just eyes in my sand.

1147
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,832
You sure it's not the other way around?

1148
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:39,040
I already said it's nothing.

1149
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,040
OK. You are the boss here.

1150
00:54:44,749 --> 00:54:45,499
I'm not talking to you.

1151
00:54:45,499 --> 00:54:47,874
Fine fine,

1152
00:54:47,874 --> 00:54:49,290
I'll stop laughing.

1153
00:54:51,915 --> 00:54:53,207
Are you still mad?

1154
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:53,832
Nezha?

1155
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:54,999
Nezha!

1156
00:54:55,707 --> 00:54:56,707
Ao Bing,

1157
00:54:57,957 --> 00:55:00,207
I've been violent and unruly since I was young,

1158
00:55:00,207 --> 00:55:02,832
making my parents worry all day.

1159
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:04,499
Your father,

1160
00:55:04,499 --> 00:55:06,374
though he attacked Chentang Pass,

1161
00:55:06,374 --> 00:55:08,874
I know he only risked everything

1162
00:55:08,874 --> 00:55:10,124
for your sake.

1163
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,499
And today,

1164
00:55:12,499 --> 00:55:15,040
my brothers were so kind to me.

1165
00:55:15,915 --> 00:55:18,165
Our families have sacrificed so much for us.

1166
00:55:18,457 --> 00:55:19,540
You're a monster,

1167
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:20,874
and I'm a demon.

1168
00:55:20,874 --> 00:55:22,874
We're both burdens for our families.

1169
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,665
So what if we were born as demons?

1170
00:55:27,665 --> 00:55:30,207
Immortal or demon, I make the choice.

1171
00:55:30,582 --> 00:55:31,374
Once you're saved,

1172
00:55:31,374 --> 00:55:33,040
we must win ourselves a place among the immortals

1173
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,374
so our families won't have to worry anymore.

1174
00:55:34,374 --> 00:55:35,207
Yes!

1175
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:36,207
Only by becoming immortals,

1176
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:37,707
can we have everyone's respect.

1177
00:55:37,707 --> 00:55:38,624
Deal!

1178
00:55:39,082 --> 00:55:42,040
I'm going to become an immortal!

1179
00:55:47,999 --> 00:55:48,707
Only with courage and diligence can great progress be made.

1180
00:55:48,707 --> 00:55:51,874
[Level 2: Ascension Falls]
Only with courage and diligence can great progress be made.

1181
00:55:51,874 --> 00:55:53,040
[Level 2: Ascension Falls]
At this speed, cultivating

1182
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:53,457
[Level 2: Ascension Falls]
At this speed, cultivating

1183
00:55:53,457 --> 00:55:56,374
a hundred more years would still be in vain.

1184
00:55:56,624 --> 00:55:58,290
About cultivating,

1185
00:55:58,290 --> 00:56:00,874
the priorities are vitality, energy, and spirit.

1186
00:56:00,874 --> 00:56:01,957
If you feel it's difficult,

1187
00:56:01,957 --> 00:56:02,999
or you feel exhausted,

1188
00:56:02,999 --> 00:56:07,249
it's because you were born demons.

1189
00:56:07,249 --> 00:56:08,749
Only by giving it your all

1190
00:56:08,749 --> 00:56:10,999
will you have a chance to change your destiny

1191
00:56:10,999 --> 00:56:12,665
and achieve immortality.

1192
00:56:14,457 --> 00:56:17,457
Life or death, of none I'm scared,

1193
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:20,457
defying authority is what I've revered.

1194
00:56:20,457 --> 00:56:23,457
My fate is mine, not heaven's plan.

1195
00:56:23,457 --> 00:56:27,040
This bad boy will become a godly man!

1196
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:30,124
Bravo!

1197
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,499
Just a few lines, yet so powerful,

1198
00:56:33,499 --> 00:56:34,999
truly inspiring.

1199
00:56:34,999 --> 00:56:36,999
A great poem, indeed.

1200
00:56:36,999 --> 00:56:40,415
This is something all of you should learn from.

1201
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:42,832
Really?

1202
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:43,999
Is it that good?

1203
00:56:44,374 --> 00:56:45,499
I just made it up.

1204
00:56:45,499 --> 00:56:46,665
It is good.

1205
00:56:46,665 --> 00:56:47,582
Every word counts,

1206
00:56:47,582 --> 00:56:48,707
and it's inspiring.

1207
00:56:48,707 --> 00:56:50,457
A poem like this

1208
00:56:50,457 --> 00:56:52,999
shows your ambition, young man.

1209
00:56:52,999 --> 00:56:54,457
A true young hero

1210
00:56:54,457 --> 00:56:55,749
with a bright future ahead!

1211
00:56:55,874 --> 00:56:57,499
Oh, come on. It's just fine.

1212
00:56:57,499 --> 00:56:59,165
Actually, it still has some tiny flaws.

1213
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:00,540
More like plenty of flaws.

1214
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:01,207
Let me ask you,

1215
00:57:01,207 --> 00:57:02,832
what's with those dark eye circles?

1216
00:57:02,832 --> 00:57:05,040
It's obvious you stay up late all the time.

1217
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,207
Your life is undisciplined,

1218
00:57:06,207 --> 00:57:07,249
your diet unhealthy,

1219
00:57:07,249 --> 00:57:09,082
and you can't even manage basic self-control.

1220
00:57:09,082 --> 00:57:11,165
How can you dream of becoming an immortal?

1221
00:57:11,165 --> 00:57:12,540
I was born with dark eye circles.

1222
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:14,207
Appearance reflects the heart, don't you know?

1223
00:57:14,207 --> 00:57:15,457
Take a look at yourself in the mirror.

1224
00:57:15,457 --> 00:57:17,003
Ridiculous, reckless and sloppy.

1225
00:57:16,999 --> 00:57:19,873
If you were my disciple, I'd make you rebuild your human form.

1226
00:57:19,874 --> 00:57:20,957
Can it be rebuilt?

1227
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:22,624
Then there's hope for my looks, right?

1228
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:23,999
Teach me, please.

1229
00:57:23,999 --> 00:57:25,790
I knew you came to find yourself a master.

1230
00:57:25,790 --> 00:57:26,707
Listen, kid,

1231
00:57:26,707 --> 00:57:28,540
I see you have great ambition,

1232
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:30,124
so I'll take you as my disciple.

1233
00:57:30,124 --> 00:57:30,540
Cool!

1234
00:57:30,707 --> 00:57:32,290
Master!

1235
00:57:34,082 --> 00:57:34,665
Come,

1236
00:57:34,665 --> 00:57:35,874
train with your brothers.

1237
00:57:35,874 --> 00:57:36,582
Train for what?

1238
00:57:36,582 --> 00:57:37,374
Immortality, of course.

1239
00:57:37,374 --> 00:57:38,624
I don't need you to teach me that.

1240
00:57:38,624 --> 00:57:39,499
Teach me how to be prettier.

1241
00:57:39,499 --> 00:57:40,374
Ridiculous!

1242
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:42,374
You're putting looks before cultivation?

1243
00:57:42,374 --> 00:57:43,665
Get your priorities straight.

1244
00:57:43,665 --> 00:57:45,165
Are you teaching me or not?

1245
00:57:45,165 --> 00:57:47,290
We're no longer master and disciple.

1246
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:49,249
You deserve to have panda eyes for life.

1247
00:57:49,249 --> 00:57:50,249
That's too much.

1248
00:57:50,249 --> 00:57:51,999
I was going to go easy on you!

1249
00:57:51,999 --> 00:57:52,415
What's this?

1250
00:57:52,415 --> 00:57:53,540
Are you challenging me?

1251
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:54,790
Three pills should be enough.

1252
00:57:54,790 --> 00:57:55,457
Kid,

1253
00:57:55,457 --> 00:57:57,374
go back where you came from.

1254
00:57:57,374 --> 00:57:59,415
If you keep disrupting our class,

1255
00:57:59,415 --> 00:58:01,499
this could end badly for you.

1256
00:58:02,624 --> 00:58:03,207
Apologies.

1257
00:58:42,874 --> 00:58:44,540
You're no match for me.

1258
00:58:45,749 --> 00:58:47,915
Impressive, kid.

1259
00:58:47,915 --> 00:58:49,707
I underestimated you.

1260
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:04,665
Try this!

1261
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:10,457
Yeah, teach that ignorant brat a lesson.

1262
00:59:10,457 --> 00:59:11,707
Master will surely win!

1263
00:59:11,707 --> 00:59:13,124
So fast!

1264
00:59:13,124 --> 00:59:14,124
You saw it?

1265
00:59:16,332 --> 00:59:18,332
We have no grudges between us.

1266
00:59:18,332 --> 00:59:20,082
You'd better go.

1267
00:59:20,082 --> 00:59:20,832
I cannot lose.

1268
00:59:32,290 --> 00:59:34,165
You can't even touch me.

1269
00:59:34,165 --> 00:59:35,332
Let alone fight.

1270
00:59:48,665 --> 00:59:49,332
Smart move!

1271
00:59:49,332 --> 00:59:51,203
Hold him tight, render his speed useless.

1272
00:59:52,499 --> 00:59:53,540
Surrender?

1273
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:07,540
Wait, you are...

1274
01:00:08,457 --> 01:00:09,374
Finally figured it out?

1275
01:00:09,624 --> 01:00:11,374
It's not that I'm fast,

1276
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:13,165
I just transform into electric currents,

1277
01:00:13,165 --> 01:00:15,374
traveling instantly to any location.

1278
01:00:15,374 --> 01:00:16,540
In water,

1279
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:19,040
I am invincible!

1280
01:00:33,707 --> 01:00:35,499
Impressive cryo power.

1281
01:00:38,707 --> 01:00:39,957
Stay calm.

1282
01:00:39,957 --> 01:00:42,040
Go too hard and your body will collapse!

1283
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:43,540
Ice doesn't conduct electricity.

1284
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:45,040
Let's see what else you've got.

1285
01:00:46,374 --> 01:00:48,165
Lakes and seas.
Clouds and sky.

1286
01:00:48,165 --> 01:00:51,082
By this divine talisman in my hand.
Wind is to rise and rain is to fall.

1287
01:00:51,082 --> 01:00:52,499
Swift and Uplift!

1288
01:01:02,582 --> 01:01:03,415
Father!

1289
01:01:11,082 --> 01:01:11,915
Damn it.

1290
01:01:11,915 --> 01:01:13,040
The Rain Summoning Spell.

1291
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:13,999
End this now!

1292
01:01:27,874 --> 01:01:28,540
Too late.

1293
01:01:44,415 --> 01:01:46,040
You're doomed.

1294
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:07,624
Master!

1295
01:02:07,624 --> 01:02:09,124
Master, are you all right?

1296
01:02:09,124 --> 01:02:10,415
I wasn't going to take your life.

1297
01:02:10,415 --> 01:02:11,915
You didn't have to sacrifice an arm.

1298
01:02:11,915 --> 01:02:13,499
All disciples, listen.

1299
01:02:13,499 --> 01:02:15,665
Take the demons back to the palace.

1300
01:02:15,665 --> 01:02:17,249
Yes!

1301
01:02:18,374 --> 01:02:19,124
Stop!

1302
01:02:19,124 --> 01:02:19,915
Put them down.

1303
01:02:19,915 --> 01:02:21,332
All of you, put them down!

1304
01:02:21,332 --> 01:02:24,582
May I ask if you are a member of the Chan Sect?

1305
01:02:24,582 --> 01:02:25,374
That's correct.

1306
01:02:25,374 --> 01:02:26,707
Ah.

1307
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:34,624
These are all immortals from Yu Xu Palace.

1308
01:02:34,624 --> 01:02:36,624
You must not be disrespectful.

1309
01:02:36,624 --> 01:02:37,915
Entering Yu Xu Palace

1310
01:02:37,915 --> 01:02:40,165
and receiving the teachings of the righteous path

1311
01:02:40,165 --> 01:02:42,082
may not be a bad thing.

1312
01:02:42,082 --> 01:02:44,624
All of you, drop your weapons!

1313
01:02:53,207 --> 01:02:54,207
Father!

1314
01:02:54,415 --> 01:02:55,374
Xiaobao?

1315
01:02:55,374 --> 01:02:56,457
Why have you returned?

1316
01:03:02,415 --> 01:03:03,374
Xiaobao,

1317
01:03:03,374 --> 01:03:04,582
stand down!

1318
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:13,624
Xiaobao!

1319
01:03:19,415 --> 01:03:20,665
Impudent!

1320
01:03:20,665 --> 01:03:22,457
How dare you hurt our Sect members?

1321
01:03:23,165 --> 01:03:24,749
No!

1322
01:03:39,415 --> 01:03:40,540
Father!

1323
01:03:44,374 --> 01:03:44,999
Nezha,

1324
01:03:44,999 --> 01:03:46,290
freeze the river now!

1325
01:03:59,207 --> 01:04:00,915
You can't escape!

1326
01:04:20,665 --> 01:04:21,749
Father!

1327
01:04:21,749 --> 01:04:23,082
Go!

1328
01:04:23,082 --> 01:04:24,999
Go now!

1329
01:04:24,999 --> 01:04:26,999
Run!

1330
01:04:26,999 --> 01:04:28,790
Father...

1331
01:04:36,249 --> 01:04:36,999
There's no escape.

1332
01:04:39,082 --> 01:04:40,082
Step aside.

1333
01:04:40,082 --> 01:04:41,540
He's just trying to save his father.

1334
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:42,874
You didn't have to be so brutal.

1335
01:04:47,374 --> 01:04:48,040
Hmph.

1336
01:04:52,874 --> 01:04:54,290
Panax notoginseng,

1337
01:04:54,915 --> 01:04:56,290
cattail pollen,

1338
01:04:56,707 --> 01:04:58,124
munjeet,

1339
01:04:58,665 --> 01:04:59,749
borneol,

1340
01:05:00,165 --> 01:05:01,332
dragon's blood.

1341
01:05:01,332 --> 01:05:02,124
One more basket.

1342
01:05:02,124 --> 01:05:03,040
Safflower,

1343
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:04,707
angelica,

1344
01:05:05,207 --> 01:05:06,790
pseudo-ginseng powder,

1345
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:08,040
sappanwood,

1346
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:10,124
poison nut.

1347
01:05:10,374 --> 01:05:11,040
My lord,

1348
01:05:11,249 --> 01:05:13,540
we now have everything on the list,

1349
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:16,207
along with a hundred extra baskets of sea products.

1350
01:05:16,207 --> 01:05:18,582
However, we are running out of food in the city.

1351
01:05:21,249 --> 01:05:22,415
Master Shen, a moment, please.

1352
01:05:23,749 --> 01:05:25,040
We've prepared a meal.

1353
01:05:25,582 --> 01:05:27,540
Would you honor us with your presence?

1354
01:05:33,082 --> 01:05:34,249
You...

1355
01:05:34,874 --> 01:05:36,540
Thanks to Lord Li's kindness,

1356
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:38,915
I've been taken in as a servant.

1357
01:05:39,165 --> 01:05:40,374
He may be a demon,

1358
01:05:40,374 --> 01:05:41,874
but he has a good heart.

1359
01:05:41,874 --> 01:05:43,582
As long as he behaves,

1360
01:05:43,582 --> 01:05:45,374
there's no reason he can't have a future.

1361
01:05:46,832 --> 01:05:48,540
I wonder if the dishes suit your taste.

1362
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:49,332
Not...

1363
01:05:50,290 --> 01:05:50,915
Not bad.

1364
01:05:51,499 --> 01:05:52,582
Then have some more.

1365
01:05:52,582 --> 01:05:54,040
Try this liquor as well.

1366
01:05:54,374 --> 01:05:55,540
I quit long ago.

1367
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:59,290
Cultivators must sup... suppress desires.

1368
01:05:59,290 --> 01:06:00,582
As the saying goes,

1369
01:06:00,582 --> 01:06:02,790
one must cut off urges to perfect the spirit.

1370
01:06:02,790 --> 01:06:04,207
Another saying goes,

1371
01:06:04,207 --> 01:06:06,915
one must practice kindness to polish virtue.

1372
01:06:08,124 --> 01:06:09,540
Talking won't help.

1373
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:12,415
I've already re... reached the point of no return.

1374
01:06:12,415 --> 01:06:15,082
You can't hide forever.

1375
01:06:15,082 --> 01:06:17,332
The truth will come out one day.

1376
01:06:18,124 --> 01:06:19,540
If you continue to make the

1377
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:20,915
mistake of harming others,

1378
01:06:20,915 --> 01:06:22,665
even if you can deceive everyone,

1379
01:06:22,665 --> 01:06:24,749
you won't be able to fool yourself.

1380
01:06:24,915 --> 01:06:28,540
And you will not be able to further your cultivation,

1381
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:29,874
the essence of which

1382
01:06:29,874 --> 01:06:32,040
is doing good deeds and walking the righteous path.

1383
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:32,665
Enough!

1384
01:06:32,665 --> 01:06:34,207
What nonsense!

1385
01:06:34,207 --> 01:06:35,207
You know nothing

1386
01:06:35,207 --> 01:06:36,790
about cultivation.

1387
01:06:44,999 --> 01:06:46,165
Sir!

1388
01:06:46,707 --> 01:06:48,415
Someone is here to see Master Shen.

1389
01:06:57,082 --> 01:06:58,374
Brother

1390
01:06:59,082 --> 01:07:00,374
Who did this to you?

1391
01:07:00,374 --> 01:07:02,249
Some Taoists.

1392
01:07:02,249 --> 01:07:05,374
They attacked us.

1393
01:07:06,624 --> 01:07:07,749
Father...

1394
01:07:08,249 --> 01:07:10,124
had one of his arms

1395
01:07:11,124 --> 01:07:12,874
cut off.

1396
01:07:12,874 --> 01:07:14,165
Who did it?

1397
01:07:14,499 --> 01:07:17,749
His name is...

1398
01:07:18,374 --> 01:07:19,999
Ne...

1399
01:07:19,999 --> 01:07:22,707
Zha.

1400
01:07:38,249 --> 01:07:40,415
Congratulations on passing Level 2.

1401
01:07:40,707 --> 01:07:42,374
Please inform Brother Wuliang.

1402
01:07:42,374 --> 01:07:44,707
Master is in seclusion refining pills

1403
01:07:44,707 --> 01:07:46,207
and has not emerged yet.

1404
01:07:46,207 --> 01:07:47,874
Before Level 3,

1405
01:07:47,874 --> 01:07:49,874
why don't you rest for a few days?

1406
01:07:49,874 --> 01:07:51,707
We only have two days left.

1407
01:07:51,707 --> 01:07:52,749
No need.

1408
01:07:52,749 --> 01:07:53,999
I'm totally fine.

1409
01:07:53,999 --> 01:07:55,040
Let's continue the test.

1410
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:55,999
Well,

1411
01:07:55,999 --> 01:07:57,249
as you wish.

1412
01:07:57,249 --> 01:07:58,499
The final test

1413
01:07:58,499 --> 01:08:00,665
is the demon Queen of Skull Mountain,

1414
01:08:00,665 --> 01:08:02,374
Shi Ji.

1415
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:06,374
Someone is requesting an urgent meeting with Master Taiyi.

1416
01:08:06,374 --> 01:08:07,165
Huh?

1417
01:08:07,165 --> 01:08:08,749
Please help us!

1418
01:08:08,749 --> 01:08:10,582
It's Chentang Pass.

1419
01:08:10,582 --> 01:08:12,540
Something happened!

1420
01:08:35,707 --> 01:08:36,332
Dad.

1421
01:08:38,374 --> 01:08:39,249
Mom.

1422
01:08:42,332 --> 01:08:42,874
Dad.

1423
01:08:45,082 --> 01:08:45,624
Mom.

1424
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:49,624
Dad?

1425
01:08:50,749 --> 01:08:52,165
Mom?

1426
01:09:01,957 --> 01:09:03,249
Dad!

1427
01:09:04,124 --> 01:09:06,540
Mom!

1428
01:09:27,790 --> 01:09:29,207
Calm down.

1429
01:09:29,207 --> 01:09:29,874
Let's keep looking.

1430
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:30,832
Keep looking.

1431
01:09:33,707 --> 01:09:36,374
I received an urgent report as soon as I ended my seclusion.

1432
01:09:36,374 --> 01:09:39,415
Who could have committed such a horrendous crime?

1433
01:09:39,415 --> 01:09:40,374
Master,

1434
01:09:40,374 --> 01:09:41,749
The Shieldos said

1435
01:09:41,749 --> 01:09:43,832
they were struck by a tremendous force

1436
01:09:43,832 --> 01:09:45,124
and lost consciousness.

1437
01:09:45,124 --> 01:09:46,207
When they woke up,

1438
01:09:46,207 --> 01:09:48,207
people of Chentang Pass had already been slaughtered.

1439
01:09:48,707 --> 01:09:50,332
We haven't obtained the elixir yet.

1440
01:09:50,332 --> 01:09:52,499
Why would they do that?

1441
01:09:52,499 --> 01:09:53,165
Brother,

1442
01:09:53,665 --> 01:09:54,915
any clue?

1443
01:09:54,915 --> 01:09:56,040
No, no.

1444
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:56,832
I was just thinking,

1445
01:09:56,832 --> 01:09:59,124
where did all this lava come from?

1446
01:09:59,790 --> 01:10:00,874
Exactly.

1447
01:10:00,874 --> 01:10:03,040
There are no volcanoes for hundreds of miles around.

1448
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:05,040
This is truly bizarre.

1449
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:06,874
Everyone, come quick!

1450
01:10:09,165 --> 01:10:10,999
What demon is this?

1451
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:13,040
This was...

1452
01:10:14,332 --> 01:10:15,374
left by a dragon's claw.

1453
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:17,582
Impossible!

1454
01:10:18,165 --> 01:10:21,082
The dragons are all in Eastern Sea,

1455
01:10:21,082 --> 01:10:23,082
guarding the Suppression Seal.

1456
01:10:23,082 --> 01:10:25,749
Not a single one could have left.

1457
01:10:25,749 --> 01:10:26,457
Master,

1458
01:10:26,457 --> 01:10:27,957
if I remember correctly,

1459
01:10:27,957 --> 01:10:30,124
Queen Ao Run of Western Sea

1460
01:10:30,124 --> 01:10:31,874
has a special skill

1461
01:10:31,874 --> 01:10:32,874
called the Sky...

1462
01:10:33,749 --> 01:10:35,040
Sky-Splitting Claw.

1463
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,082
Are you saying she used the Sky-Splitting Claw

1464
01:10:37,082 --> 01:10:38,582
to cross into Chentang Pass?

1465
01:10:38,582 --> 01:10:40,374
That explains the lava.

1466
01:10:40,374 --> 01:10:43,332
It must have been transported from the purgatory.

1467
01:10:43,332 --> 01:10:45,124
But she's watched by the Dragon King of Eastern Sea.

1468
01:10:45,124 --> 01:10:47,040
It's impossible for her to cross over.

1469
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:49,374
Then there's only one possibility left.

1470
01:10:49,957 --> 01:10:52,332
The thing I worried most about

1471
01:10:52,332 --> 01:10:54,207
has happened.

1472
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:56,374
The King of Eastern Sea has betrayed us?

1473
01:10:57,124 --> 01:10:59,165
This is too serious an accusation.

1474
01:10:59,165 --> 01:11:01,665
Could we be wrong?

1475
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:03,749
No.

1476
01:11:03,749 --> 01:11:05,665
It's them!

1477
01:11:08,374 --> 01:11:09,499
What are you doing?

1478
01:11:17,374 --> 01:11:18,332
Don't be impulsive.

1479
01:11:18,957 --> 01:11:20,665
Are you going to the Dragon Palace?

1480
01:11:20,665 --> 01:11:21,874
That's the direction of Skull Mountain.

1481
01:11:23,332 --> 01:11:26,374
The dragons slaughtered innocent civilians,

1482
01:11:26,374 --> 01:11:29,124
committing this unforgivable atrocity.

1483
01:11:29,124 --> 01:11:31,874
No need to consult with fellow Golden Immortals.

1484
01:11:31,874 --> 01:11:33,957
I'll strike first and explain later.

1485
01:11:33,957 --> 01:11:35,165
Crana,

1486
01:11:35,165 --> 01:11:36,207
back to the palace with me.

1487
01:11:36,207 --> 01:11:39,124
Summon all the Demon Hunters.

1488
01:11:39,124 --> 01:11:39,874
Roger.

1489
01:11:39,874 --> 01:11:41,332
Brother,

1490
01:11:41,332 --> 01:11:43,582
Nezha's parents were killed by demons.

1491
01:11:43,582 --> 01:11:46,832
We can't let anything happen to the child.

1492
01:11:46,832 --> 01:11:48,957
Take Deero and go for him now.

1493
01:11:48,957 --> 01:11:50,582
Yes.

1494
01:11:54,124 --> 01:11:55,999
I know you're heartbroken right now

1495
01:11:55,999 --> 01:11:57,124
but can you please

1496
01:11:57,124 --> 01:11:58,290
calm down for a moment?

1497
01:12:01,582 --> 01:12:02,124
Can you

1498
01:12:02,415 --> 01:12:04,332
take me to the Dragon Palace first?

1499
01:12:04,332 --> 01:12:05,874
I'll confront my father and master

1500
01:12:05,874 --> 01:12:06,999
to get to the bottom of this.

1501
01:12:06,999 --> 01:12:09,707
Will that bring my parents back?

1502
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:22,040
[Level 3: Skull Mountain]

1503
01:12:22,624 --> 01:12:24,749
Mirror mirror on the wall,

1504
01:12:24,749 --> 01:12:27,665
who's the fairest within ten miles and more?

1505
01:12:27,665 --> 01:12:29,249
It's you, my lady.

1506
01:12:29,249 --> 01:12:30,540
[Lady Shi Ji]

1507
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:33,082
[Lady Shi Ji]
And who is the fairest within a hundred miles?

1508
01:12:33,082 --> 01:12:33,165
[Lady Shi Ji]
And who is the fairest within a hundred miles?

1509
01:12:33,165 --> 01:12:34,707
It's you, my lady.

1510
01:12:34,707 --> 01:12:35,749
What about a thousand miles?

1511
01:12:35,749 --> 01:12:36,665
It's you.

1512
01:12:36,665 --> 01:12:37,499
And ten thousand miles?

1513
01:12:37,499 --> 01:12:37,957
It's you.

1514
01:12:37,957 --> 01:12:38,540
And in the whole world?

1515
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:40,415
Still you.

1516
01:12:40,915 --> 01:12:42,040
Do you think I'm stupid?

1517
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:42,915
Lie better, at least.

1518
01:12:42,915 --> 01:12:44,040
No, no.

1519
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:46,457
I was just trying not to upset you.

1520
01:12:46,457 --> 01:12:47,957
You know what?

1521
01:12:47,957 --> 01:12:49,957
Telling the truth won't make me mad.

1522
01:12:49,957 --> 01:12:51,582
Seriously?

1523
01:12:51,582 --> 01:12:54,874
I, Lady Shi Ji, am indeed a stunning beauty,

1524
01:12:54,874 --> 01:12:56,999
but I know there's always someone better.

1525
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:58,290
Go on and ask then.

1526
01:12:58,290 --> 01:12:59,832
Am I the fairest of them all?

1527
01:12:59,832 --> 01:13:00,207
No.

1528
01:13:01,249 --> 01:13:02,749
Fair enough.

1529
01:13:02,749 --> 01:13:05,540
Am I the fairest within ten thousand miles?

1530
01:13:05,540 --> 01:13:05,999
No.

1531
01:13:05,999 --> 01:13:07,457
What about a thousand miles?

1532
01:13:07,457 --> 01:13:07,874
No.

1533
01:13:07,874 --> 01:13:08,540
Hundred miles?

1534
01:13:08,540 --> 01:13:09,207
No.

1535
01:13:09,207 --> 01:13:10,290
Ten miles?

1536
01:13:10,290 --> 01:13:11,040
Nope.

1537
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:14,457
Am I even the fairest on this mountain?

1538
01:13:14,457 --> 01:13:16,165
Nope.

1539
01:13:16,165 --> 01:13:16,874
Screw you!

1540
01:13:16,874 --> 01:13:19,082
There isn't any other female in this mountain.

1541
01:13:19,082 --> 01:13:20,540
I'm female, too.

1542
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:23,749
You promised you wouldn't get mad.

1543
01:13:25,415 --> 01:13:26,749
You are prettier than me?

1544
01:13:26,749 --> 01:13:27,499
Help!

1545
01:13:27,499 --> 01:13:29,374
How on earth?!

1546
01:13:32,332 --> 01:13:34,874
Demon, show yourself!

1547
01:13:34,874 --> 01:13:36,290
Who are you calling demon?

1548
01:13:36,290 --> 01:13:37,457
It's Lady Shi Ji.

1549
01:13:50,082 --> 01:13:50,915
Darn kid.

1550
01:13:50,915 --> 01:13:51,915
Have we even met?

1551
01:13:51,915 --> 01:13:53,499
What on earth are you doing?

1552
01:13:55,624 --> 01:13:56,707
You will be exposed.

1553
01:13:56,707 --> 01:13:57,582
Let me.

1554
01:13:57,582 --> 01:13:58,540
Stay out of it.

1555
01:14:22,332 --> 01:14:25,707
You think you can defeat me?

1556
01:14:47,207 --> 01:14:51,832
The entire mountain is my body.

1557
01:14:51,832 --> 01:14:54,249
You'll see that you can't destroy me.

1558
01:15:03,915 --> 01:15:04,915
If you use more force,

1559
01:15:04,915 --> 01:15:06,582
your body will collapse!

1560
01:15:06,582 --> 01:15:08,082
I said

1561
01:15:08,082 --> 01:15:12,207
stay out of it!

1562
01:15:21,499 --> 01:15:22,749
It's already started!

1563
01:15:23,707 --> 01:15:24,415
Crap!

1564
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:34,290
I'm so screwed.

1565
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:37,499
Luckily there's some left.

1566
01:15:37,499 --> 01:15:39,832
I shall live to fight another day.

1567
01:15:39,832 --> 01:15:40,749
Darn kid.

1568
01:15:40,749 --> 01:15:42,249
Just you wait.

1569
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,624
Nine-Dragon Fire Trap!

1570
01:15:54,874 --> 01:15:56,374
No escape!

1571
01:15:58,207 --> 01:15:59,040
Oh my!

1572
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:00,540
Reckless child.

1573
01:16:01,457 --> 01:16:02,957
You body has almost gone.

1574
01:16:02,957 --> 01:16:04,457
Are you trying to kill yourself?

1575
01:16:04,749 --> 01:16:06,707
Was that fire earlier?

1576
01:16:06,707 --> 01:16:08,040
Isn't Nezha

1577
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:09,665
a frost mage?

1578
01:16:09,665 --> 01:16:11,249
Who... who said that?

1579
01:16:11,249 --> 01:16:12,624
Frost, flame, I taught it all.

1580
01:16:12,624 --> 01:16:13,790
His powers are...

1581
01:16:13,790 --> 01:16:14,957
a combination of ice and fire.

1582
01:16:14,957 --> 01:16:16,749
Is that possible?

1583
01:16:16,749 --> 01:16:18,707
The Spirit Pearl is endowed with unparalleled talents.

1584
01:16:18,707 --> 01:16:19,915
Can't judge him by normal standards.

1585
01:16:19,915 --> 01:16:21,040
Which one of us is the teacher?

1586
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:22,332
You think you know better than me?

1587
01:16:22,332 --> 01:16:23,082
I wouldn't dare.

1588
01:16:23,082 --> 01:16:24,082
However,

1589
01:16:24,082 --> 01:16:26,082
I did sense a strong presence

1590
01:16:26,082 --> 01:16:28,249
of demonic energy earlier

1591
01:16:28,249 --> 01:16:29,707
About that...

1592
01:16:29,707 --> 01:16:31,207
Shi Ji must have released it.

1593
01:16:31,207 --> 01:16:32,790
What are you saying, fatty?

1594
01:16:32,790 --> 01:16:33,874
I did not...

1595
01:16:33,874 --> 01:16:35,582
Was it you? Was it you? Was it you?

1596
01:16:35,582 --> 01:16:36,207
Say it!

1597
01:16:36,207 --> 01:16:37,582
It was me, it was me!

1598
01:16:37,582 --> 01:16:38,540
Stop shaking!

1599
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:39,832
I'm about to throw up!

1600
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,082
See? I told you.

1601
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:47,040
Nezha,

1602
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:48,790
you've passed three levels.

1603
01:16:49,165 --> 01:16:49,790
Today,

1604
01:16:49,790 --> 01:16:52,457
I will personally cast

1605
01:16:52,457 --> 01:16:53,957
the Ascension Spell for you.

1606
01:17:02,332 --> 01:17:04,374
I went through all of this long long ago.

1607
01:17:04,374 --> 01:17:06,040
I was probably too nervous.

1608
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:08,165
The Ascension Spell is longer than I remember.

1609
01:17:18,249 --> 01:17:20,332
From now on,

1610
01:17:20,332 --> 01:17:23,665
you're an Immortal of the Chan Sect.

1611
01:17:44,999 --> 01:17:48,207
This, Yu Xu Treasure Vault

1612
01:17:48,207 --> 01:17:50,374
houses all sorts of rare magic items.

1613
01:17:50,374 --> 01:17:51,457
Elixir Reparo.

1614
01:17:52,874 --> 01:17:54,499
You can only pick one.

1615
01:17:54,499 --> 01:17:55,957
Don't you need more time to decide?

1616
01:17:55,957 --> 01:17:57,374
Elixir Reparo.

1617
01:18:59,124 --> 01:19:01,415
Yu Xu Palace has sent messengers

1618
01:19:01,415 --> 01:19:05,040
to inform the Twelve about what the dragons did.

1619
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:06,707
However, due to the great distance,

1620
01:19:06,707 --> 01:19:09,040
[Tianyuan Cauldron]
my brothers and sisters can't make it here sooner.

1621
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:10,207
[Tianyuan Cauldron]
my brothers and sisters can't make it here sooner.

1622
01:19:10,207 --> 01:19:11,124
[Tianyuan Cauldron]
This time,

1623
01:19:11,124 --> 01:19:13,457
[Tianyuan Cauldron]
I will personally lead the hunt

1624
01:19:13,457 --> 01:19:13,499
[Tianyuan Cauldron]
on the dragons.

1625
01:19:13,499 --> 01:19:15,874
[Tianyuan Cauldron]
on the dragons.

1626
01:19:15,874 --> 01:19:17,040
Nezha,

1627
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:19,999
I will you fight alongside me?

1628
01:19:19,999 --> 01:19:22,540
Let me go back to Chentang Pass first.

1629
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:25,290
Then we'll seek revenge on the Dragon King.

1630
01:19:25,290 --> 01:19:26,582
OK.

1631
01:19:26,582 --> 01:19:28,540
With your extraordinary combat skills,

1632
01:19:28,540 --> 01:19:32,874
you'd be a great help in destroying the Dragon Palace.

1633
01:19:50,874 --> 01:19:52,332
I've paid back

1634
01:19:53,749 --> 01:19:54,874
everything I owed you.

1635
01:19:55,957 --> 01:19:57,082
Wait.

1636
01:19:57,082 --> 01:19:58,415
Wait until my body is restored.

1637
01:19:58,415 --> 01:19:59,707
Let's go to the Dragon Palace together, okay?

1638
01:19:59,707 --> 01:20:01,415
You know well what I'm going to do.

1639
01:20:02,624 --> 01:20:05,207
You being there will only make it harder.

1640
01:20:07,165 --> 01:20:09,707
Next time we meet,

1641
01:20:10,207 --> 01:20:12,540
it will be as foes, not friends.

1642
01:20:14,290 --> 01:20:14,999
Ugh...

1643
01:20:14,999 --> 01:20:16,165
Karma it is.

1644
01:20:20,457 --> 01:20:21,540
No, you can't leave!

1645
01:20:22,290 --> 01:20:24,332
Your soul will scatter before you get to the Dragon Palace.

1646
01:20:29,124 --> 01:20:30,874
Nine-Dragon Fire Trap!

1647
01:20:38,290 --> 01:20:39,790
Calm down, will you?

1648
01:20:39,790 --> 01:20:40,540
Going now

1649
01:20:40,540 --> 01:20:42,374
won't change anything.

1650
01:20:43,124 --> 01:20:44,374
Leave me alone.

1651
01:20:46,874 --> 01:20:49,165
I promised Nezha I'd save you no matter what.

1652
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:01,415
Pah! Pah!

1653
01:21:01,415 --> 01:21:03,457
Suffocating!

1654
01:21:34,332 --> 01:21:39,124
[Relic of Dragon Palace]

1655
01:21:56,290 --> 01:21:58,332
Who's there?

1656
01:21:58,332 --> 01:22:01,332
I'm Immortal Wuliang of the Chan Sect.

1657
01:22:01,332 --> 01:22:02,415
Ao Guang,

1658
01:22:02,415 --> 01:22:03,749
do you admit your guilt?

1659
01:22:05,624 --> 01:22:06,874
So,

1660
01:22:06,874 --> 01:22:08,499
you've found out?

1661
01:22:08,499 --> 01:22:09,374
Is

1662
01:22:09,374 --> 01:22:11,165
Ao Bing still alive?

1663
01:22:11,165 --> 01:22:12,540
I'll accept whatever punishment you give,

1664
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:14,499
but please spare my son.

1665
01:22:14,499 --> 01:22:16,082
Nonsense!

1666
01:22:16,082 --> 01:22:19,707
The Court of Heaven ordered your clan to suppress the sea monsters.

1667
01:22:19,707 --> 01:22:21,540
Instead, you colluded with them

1668
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:23,957
and slaughtered Chentang Pass.

1669
01:22:23,957 --> 01:22:25,207
Chentang Pass?

1670
01:22:25,207 --> 01:22:28,082
The dragons have committed an unforgivable crime.

1671
01:22:28,082 --> 01:22:28,707
Today,

1672
01:22:28,707 --> 01:22:31,624
justice shall be served.

1673
01:22:48,707 --> 01:22:50,374
Around the earth and skies of light.

1674
01:22:50,374 --> 01:22:52,040
Unleash the power with boundless might.

1675
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:53,874
Let the Tianyuan rise, stand tall.

1676
01:22:53,874 --> 01:22:56,374
Reign supreme above them all.

1677
01:22:56,374 --> 01:22:57,790
Open Cauldron!

1678
01:23:27,915 --> 01:23:29,707
Show yourselves!

1679
01:23:32,874 --> 01:23:35,999
What have you done to Chentang Pass?

1680
01:23:35,999 --> 01:23:37,499
Didn't big brother tell us

1681
01:23:37,499 --> 01:23:39,707
to follow Master Shen's orders?

1682
01:23:40,082 --> 01:23:42,207
Shen Gongbao?!

1683
01:23:51,874 --> 01:23:53,957
Did you notice what's going on above us?

1684
01:23:53,957 --> 01:23:56,707
Maybe you should focus on the present.

1685
01:23:58,749 --> 01:23:59,582
My king,

1686
01:23:59,582 --> 01:24:00,790
we can't sit here and wait to die!

1687
01:24:00,790 --> 01:24:02,082
If I go into battle,

1688
01:24:02,082 --> 01:24:03,415
the Suppression Seal will...

1689
01:24:03,415 --> 01:24:04,415
Leave that to us.

1690
01:24:04,415 --> 01:24:05,374
Joining all our powers,

1691
01:24:05,374 --> 01:24:07,332
we can hold it for long enough.

1692
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:09,415
Fine.

1693
01:24:23,790 --> 01:24:26,124
I've had enough!

1694
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:37,082
You wretched demon!

1695
01:24:47,999 --> 01:24:52,040
This is a once-in-a-millennium chance for revenge.

1696
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:54,332
Break out of purgatory!

1697
01:24:54,332 --> 01:24:56,290
Destroy the Dragon Palace!

1698
01:26:28,874 --> 01:26:30,540
Soul Blade!

1699
01:26:50,957 --> 01:26:51,749
Old fool!

1700
01:26:51,749 --> 01:26:52,624
Taste my sword!

1701
01:27:08,082 --> 01:27:09,707
Releasing demonic energy like this...

1702
01:27:09,707 --> 01:27:11,957
aren't you afraid of exposing your identity?

1703
01:27:11,957 --> 01:27:13,915
I told you,

1704
01:27:13,915 --> 01:27:16,624
if you dared to harm Chentang Pass,

1705
01:27:16,624 --> 01:27:20,415
I would smash your palace into PIECES!

1706
01:27:24,832 --> 01:27:25,665
Tell me!

1707
01:27:25,665 --> 01:27:27,499
Is Ao Bing dead?

1708
01:28:32,374 --> 01:28:34,582
Move! Out of my way!

1709
01:29:10,082 --> 01:29:11,207
Rise!

1710
01:30:21,707 --> 01:30:23,707
Do you have a death wish?

1711
01:30:23,707 --> 01:30:27,040
Let's see how long your body can take it.

1712
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:28,874
I don't care if I live or die.

1713
01:30:28,874 --> 01:30:31,207
As long as you're dead!

1714
01:30:49,207 --> 01:30:51,082
Now is the time!

1715
01:31:09,332 --> 01:31:11,415
Look what you've done!

1716
01:31:11,415 --> 01:31:14,874
Is annihilation for all really what you want?

1717
01:31:17,540 --> 01:31:18,874
The chains.

1718
01:31:25,457 --> 01:31:28,749
Even the Eastern Sea Dragon King can't match your power.

1719
01:31:28,749 --> 01:31:31,249
I was right after all.

1720
01:31:31,249 --> 01:31:35,207
You're exactly what the Chan Sect needs.

1721
01:31:35,207 --> 01:31:38,374
Your parents spent their lives fighting evil.

1722
01:31:38,374 --> 01:31:39,374
From now on,

1723
01:31:39,374 --> 01:31:42,374
you must carry on their legacy

1724
01:31:42,374 --> 01:31:45,999
and eliminate all the demons.

1725
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:49,207
Let me avenge your loss

1726
01:31:49,207 --> 01:31:51,540
by turning these evil dragons into pills.

1727
01:31:51,915 --> 01:31:53,332
Escort me!

1728
01:31:53,332 --> 01:31:54,207
Yes, master!

1729
01:32:41,624 --> 01:32:42,499
Nezha!

1730
01:32:42,999 --> 01:32:45,040
Nezha!

1731
01:32:45,290 --> 01:32:45,999
Nezha!

1732
01:32:46,790 --> 01:32:47,915
Nezha!

1733
01:32:48,165 --> 01:32:48,832
Nezha!

1734
01:32:49,374 --> 01:32:50,124
Dad!

1735
01:32:50,332 --> 01:32:51,374
Nezha!

1736
01:32:51,374 --> 01:32:52,165
Mom!

1737
01:32:52,499 --> 01:32:53,165
Nezha!

1738
01:32:54,332 --> 01:32:55,540
Nezha!

1739
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:01,999
Son, are you alright?

1740
01:33:01,999 --> 01:33:03,540
Your body...

1741
01:33:03,540 --> 01:33:06,874
I... I...

1742
01:33:06,874 --> 01:33:08,124
They already know

1743
01:33:08,124 --> 01:33:09,665
about you and Ao Bing.

1744
01:33:10,999 --> 01:33:13,249
I... I...

1745
01:33:13,249 --> 01:33:15,582
I thought...

1746
01:33:15,582 --> 01:33:20,624
I'd never see you again.

1747
01:33:28,374 --> 01:33:29,957
Master is still casting the spell.

1748
01:33:29,957 --> 01:33:33,040
We need to buy as much time as we can.

1749
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:33,707
Nezha,

1750
01:33:33,707 --> 01:33:35,665
it wasn't my father who slaughtered Chentang Pass.

1751
01:33:37,082 --> 01:33:38,832
The real culprit

1752
01:33:38,832 --> 01:33:40,707
is him, the Immortal Wuliang!

1753
01:33:59,540 --> 01:34:00,207
Shieldos!

1754
01:34:48,582 --> 01:34:50,040
Dragons?

1755
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:51,499
Brother,

1756
01:34:51,583 --> 01:34:54,458
it's been a while.

1757
01:34:54,458 --> 01:34:56,875
Why are you here?

1758
01:34:57,958 --> 01:34:58,750
Shen Gongbao,

1759
01:34:58,750 --> 01:35:00,333
you collude with the dragons.

1760
01:35:00,333 --> 01:35:01,583
What are you up to?

1761
01:35:01,583 --> 01:35:04,000
I should be ask... asking you.

1762
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,458
You captured my father.

1763
01:35:05,458 --> 01:35:07,041
What are you up to?

1764
01:35:07,666 --> 01:35:10,125
Who said I captured your father?

1765
01:35:10,125 --> 01:35:12,208
Only you know my family's situation.

1766
01:35:12,208 --> 01:35:14,250
If you didn't give the order,

1767
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:17,875
why would Nezha and the Demon Hunters hunt my father down?

1768
01:35:17,875 --> 01:35:20,333
And my little brother's arrow wound...

1769
01:35:20,333 --> 01:35:22,291
He was obviously

1770
01:35:22,291 --> 01:35:25,500
shot by your disciple, Deero!

1771
01:35:29,833 --> 01:35:33,666
There's the talent I recruited myself.

1772
01:35:33,666 --> 01:35:36,958
Nothing slips past you.

1773
01:35:38,291 --> 01:35:41,583
Having done your dirty work for years

1774
01:35:41,583 --> 01:35:43,333
I can certainly guess your purpose here

1775
01:35:43,333 --> 01:35:45,666
putting up a show in Chentang Pass.

1776
01:35:45,666 --> 01:35:49,333
You are trying to fram... frame the dragons, aren't you?

1777
01:35:49,333 --> 01:35:53,416
Is this how you repay me, your brother and mentor?

1778
01:35:53,416 --> 01:35:56,708
You've always use... used me for your benefit.

1779
01:35:56,708 --> 01:35:58,041
Between you and me,

1780
01:35:58,041 --> 01:35:59,750
there's only grudge, not gratitude.

1781
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:04,333
May I interest you in a deal,

1782
01:36:04,333 --> 01:36:05,583
Master Immortal?

1783
01:36:06,416 --> 01:36:09,291
As the overseer of Yu Xu Palace,

1784
01:36:09,291 --> 01:36:13,666
you must know the spell to break the Sea-Stabilizing Chains.

1785
01:36:13,666 --> 01:36:15,333
I do.

1786
01:36:15,333 --> 01:36:16,708
So what?

1787
01:36:16,708 --> 01:36:18,583
You... you are going to rebel?

1788
01:36:18,583 --> 01:36:21,375
A thousand years ago, the four of us fought in the celestial realm together.

1789
01:36:21,375 --> 01:36:22,791
Who has then betrayed us and

1790
01:36:22,791 --> 01:36:24,166
cast us into purgatory?

1791
01:36:24,166 --> 01:36:26,750
Now Wuliang is going after Ao Guang,

1792
01:36:26,750 --> 01:36:28,375
and that's exactly what we want.

1793
01:36:28,833 --> 01:36:32,708
I've long heard that Immortal Wuliang recruits talents without bias.

1794
01:36:32,708 --> 01:36:36,166
I trust you know well what we can do.

1795
01:36:36,166 --> 01:36:38,791
If you can free us from purgatory

1796
01:36:38,791 --> 01:36:40,666
and help us achieve immortality,

1797
01:36:40,666 --> 01:36:43,333
we are willing to offer our humble service.

1798
01:36:43,333 --> 01:36:46,958
Plus the secret of the Spirit Pearl and the Demon Orb.

1799
01:36:46,958 --> 01:36:48,541
The Spirit Pearl and the Demon Orb?

1800
01:36:48,541 --> 01:36:49,458
Pathetic!

1801
01:36:49,458 --> 01:36:52,791
Whe... where's your spine? Your will to fight back?

1802
01:36:52,791 --> 01:36:54,958
We were young and ignorant!

1803
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,458
A thousand years of imprisonment

1804
01:37:00,041 --> 01:37:02,625
has taught us about the rules

1805
01:37:02,958 --> 01:37:05,083
and the rulers.

1806
01:37:06,333 --> 01:37:07,625
Smart.

1807
01:37:07,625 --> 01:37:09,666
But you're so unpredictable.

1808
01:37:09,666 --> 01:37:11,583
How can I trust you?

1809
01:37:11,583 --> 01:37:14,458
Unless you let me place on you...

1810
01:37:14,458 --> 01:37:15,791
We are willing.

1811
01:37:25,916 --> 01:37:27,625
The three dragons willingly agreed

1812
01:37:27,625 --> 01:37:30,000
to let Wuliang place a curse on them.

1813
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,750
If they dared to disobey in the future,

1814
01:37:31,750 --> 01:37:34,666
Wuliang could take their lives at any time.

1815
01:37:35,541 --> 01:37:37,916
With the curse in place, Wuliang kept his promise,

1816
01:37:37,916 --> 01:37:40,583
freeing them from the Sea-Stabilizing Chains.

1817
01:37:41,750 --> 01:37:43,750
Whenever a powerful force is discovered,

1818
01:37:43,750 --> 01:37:45,000
Wuliang orchestrates massacres,

1819
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:45,958
frames that power,

1820
01:37:45,958 --> 01:37:47,416
and sends troops to capture them.

1821
01:37:48,291 --> 01:37:49,750
Shen Gongbao will attest that

1822
01:37:49,750 --> 01:37:52,958
he has carried out many such tasks for Wuliang

1823
01:37:52,958 --> 01:37:55,458
in exchange for a chance to join the Chan Sect.

1824
01:37:56,333 --> 01:37:59,291
This time, Wuliang destroyed Chentang Pass

1825
01:37:59,291 --> 01:38:01,666
and framed the dragons of Eastern Sea.

1826
01:38:01,666 --> 01:38:03,333
As fate would have it,

1827
01:38:03,333 --> 01:38:05,208
he ended up recruiting the three dragon kings.

1828
01:38:05,208 --> 01:38:06,500
And from them,

1829
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:09,083
he learned the secret of the Demon Orb and the Spirit Pearl.

1830
01:38:10,708 --> 01:38:11,708
After that,

1831
01:38:11,708 --> 01:38:15,333
they deliberately left two clueless survivors

1832
01:38:15,333 --> 01:38:18,333
to tell Yu Xu Palace what happened.

1833
01:38:40,166 --> 01:38:42,125
Seeing no hope of breaking through,

1834
01:38:42,125 --> 01:38:43,958
Shen Gongbao came up with a plan.

1835
01:38:43,958 --> 01:38:46,416
He had the Yaksha petrify us,

1836
01:38:46,416 --> 01:38:48,916
then hide us in the sewers.

1837
01:38:48,916 --> 01:38:52,375
Then Yaksha waited for the right time to revive us.

1838
01:38:52,375 --> 01:38:53,833
And you?

1839
01:38:53,833 --> 01:38:55,666
My families are gone.

1840
01:38:56,125 --> 01:38:57,791
I have nothing left to hold onto.

1841
01:39:01,625 --> 01:39:02,958
Over there!

1842
01:39:18,916 --> 01:39:20,791
The demons captured by the Demon Hunters

1843
01:39:20,791 --> 01:39:22,791
are not, as outsiders think,

1844
01:39:22,791 --> 01:39:26,333
being reformed in Yu Xu Palace.

1845
01:39:26,333 --> 01:39:29,875
Instead, they are thrown into the Tianyuan Cauldron by Wuliang,

1846
01:39:29,875 --> 01:39:31,416
refined into pills of immortality

1847
01:39:31,416 --> 01:39:33,625
to strengthen the Chan Sect's power.

1848
01:39:33,958 --> 01:39:35,000
Brother,

1849
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,708
how could you commit such atrocities?

1850
01:39:37,708 --> 01:39:38,416
How...

1851
01:39:38,416 --> 01:39:39,750
How are you going to face our master

1852
01:39:39,750 --> 01:39:41,875
after betraying the teachings we received?

1853
01:39:41,875 --> 01:39:45,041
Now that you know what Wuliang did,

1854
01:39:45,041 --> 01:39:46,958
you should stop before it's too late.

1855
01:39:46,958 --> 01:39:48,500
Take him back to the palace

1856
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:50,625
to face punishment from the Supreme Lord.

1857
01:39:57,375 --> 01:40:00,625
The Demon Hunters were personally trained by Master Wuliang.

1858
01:40:00,625 --> 01:40:03,583
Do you think a few words would turn us against him?

1859
01:40:04,708 --> 01:40:05,958
So,

1860
01:40:05,958 --> 01:40:08,250
I was wrong about the dragons.

1861
01:40:12,125 --> 01:40:13,666
Let them go!

1862
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:32,333
Let me help.

1863
01:40:57,416 --> 01:40:58,875
You betrayed us?

1864
01:40:58,875 --> 01:41:00,583
We learned that from you, Big Brother.

1865
01:41:00,583 --> 01:41:03,041
Back then, in order to protect our kind,

1866
01:41:03,041 --> 01:41:04,625
I had no choice!

1867
01:41:04,625 --> 01:41:07,541
Well, in order to protect myself now,

1868
01:41:08,041 --> 01:41:09,875
Neither do I.

1869
01:41:10,708 --> 01:41:12,041
My King, wait for us!

1870
01:41:12,041 --> 01:41:13,208
Don't leave us behind!

1871
01:41:13,208 --> 01:41:14,625
My King, take us with you!

1872
01:41:14,625 --> 01:41:16,291
My King! My King!

1873
01:41:21,416 --> 01:41:23,125
You've all been sold out!

1874
01:41:32,416 --> 01:41:33,958
Dragon King of Southern Sea.

1875
01:41:37,958 --> 01:41:39,375
Dragon King of Northern Sea.

1876
01:41:43,708 --> 01:41:45,125
Queen of Western Sea.

1877
01:41:45,125 --> 01:41:46,708
[Ao Qin, Ao Run, Ao Shun]

1878
01:41:56,125 --> 01:41:57,750
Nephew,

1879
01:41:57,750 --> 01:41:59,458
it's playtime with your second uncle.

1880
01:42:10,416 --> 01:42:10,875
Take my spear!

1881
01:42:18,125 --> 01:42:19,958
Take my ax!

1882
01:42:22,125 --> 01:42:23,208
Take my wheel!

1883
01:42:56,458 --> 01:42:57,750
Take my wheel times a hundred!

1884
01:42:57,750 --> 01:42:58,541
Two hundred!

1885
01:42:58,541 --> 01:42:59,458
Three hundred!

1886
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,333
Enough, huh?

1887
01:43:07,333 --> 01:43:08,500
No way!

1888
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:09,458
There weren't that many.

1889
01:43:10,208 --> 01:43:11,125
Your body is still unstable.

1890
01:43:11,125 --> 01:43:11,958
Don't exhaust yourself.

1891
01:43:11,958 --> 01:43:13,375
For my mistakes,

1892
01:43:13,375 --> 01:43:16,541
I would give my life for freeing the dragons.

1893
01:43:17,666 --> 01:43:19,833
Young and vicious.

1894
01:43:21,125 --> 01:43:23,333
Let me have some fun with you, little one.

1895
01:43:54,750 --> 01:43:55,583
Bullying children,

1896
01:43:55,583 --> 01:43:56,916
shameless and vile!

1897
01:44:06,625 --> 01:44:07,791
Hey!

1898
01:44:07,791 --> 01:44:09,125
How dare you hit your master's brother!

1899
01:44:09,125 --> 01:44:10,083
Bullying an uncle,

1900
01:44:10,083 --> 01:44:11,000
eat a knuckle!

1901
01:44:49,958 --> 01:44:50,791
This won't do.

1902
01:44:50,791 --> 01:44:51,333
It's a mess.

1903
01:44:52,125 --> 01:44:53,166
Then let's make it messier.

1904
01:44:53,166 --> 01:44:54,458
How about some vapor?

1905
01:44:55,333 --> 01:44:55,958
Sure.

1906
01:44:59,458 --> 01:45:00,375
Take them down!

1907
01:45:07,791 --> 01:45:09,666
Watch out for sneak attacks.

1908
01:45:16,791 --> 01:45:18,625
There you are.

1909
01:45:20,458 --> 01:45:22,000
Careful, it's me!

1910
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:22,958
Brother?

1911
01:45:22,958 --> 01:45:24,583
Sorry, sorry.

1912
01:45:24,583 --> 01:45:25,458
Nezha!

1913
01:45:28,125 --> 01:45:29,000
Ah!

1914
01:45:31,458 --> 01:45:32,458
Surprise!

1915
01:45:32,458 --> 01:45:33,416
Ha ha!

1916
01:45:33,541 --> 01:45:34,708
Transformation Spell?

1917
01:45:41,375 --> 01:45:42,458
Are you insane?

1918
01:45:42,458 --> 01:45:43,791
You can't fool me.

1919
01:45:45,875 --> 01:45:46,625
Huh?

1920
01:45:47,416 --> 01:45:48,125
Which one of you...

1921
01:45:48,500 --> 01:45:48,958
Code.

1922
01:45:48,958 --> 01:45:50,291
She sells seashells by the seashore.

1923
01:45:50,625 --> 01:45:51,625
What?

1924
01:45:51,625 --> 01:45:52,708
You don’t know the code.

1925
01:45:52,708 --> 01:45:53,625
Impostor!

1926
01:45:55,208 --> 01:45:56,875
So you really are an impostor!

1927
01:46:02,041 --> 01:46:03,541
Unbelievable!

1928
01:46:09,750 --> 01:46:10,958
Serves you right.

1929
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:12,958
Huh?

1930
01:46:12,958 --> 01:46:13,708
Code.

1931
01:46:13,708 --> 01:46:19,791
Eh... he sells bells in the big well?

1932
01:46:19,791 --> 01:46:20,375
Wrong!

1933
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
It's "she sells seashells by the seashore

1934
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,291
and the shells she sells all smell for sure”.

1935
01:46:25,291 --> 01:46:26,541
I'm the real one!

1936
01:46:26,541 --> 01:46:28,958
How come I don't know this code?

1937
01:46:28,958 --> 01:46:30,458
We just made it up!

1938
01:46:32,333 --> 01:46:34,000
Can't you make it easier?

1939
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,125
It's too hard!

1940
01:46:37,916 --> 01:46:39,541
You idiot!

1941
01:46:39,541 --> 01:46:40,208
Go away!

1942
01:46:40,208 --> 01:46:41,041
Impostor!

1943
01:46:41,041 --> 01:46:42,458
I'm the real Ao Shun!

1944
01:46:42,458 --> 01:46:43,958
Crap! You don't know the code!

1945
01:46:43,958 --> 01:46:45,291
Neither do you!

1946
01:46:46,208 --> 01:46:46,916
That's true.

1947
01:46:46,916 --> 01:46:48,708
Does it mean I'm an impostor, too?

1948
01:46:50,041 --> 01:46:51,708
My goodness.

1949
01:46:51,916 --> 01:46:53,208
Tai Chi flows in harmony divine.

1950
01:46:53,208 --> 01:46:54,458
Five elements perfectly align.

1951
01:46:54,458 --> 01:46:55,916
True fire of Samadhi ignites the gold.

1952
01:46:55,916 --> 01:46:57,208
A perfect pill, its power to unfold.

1953
01:46:57,208 --> 01:46:59,833
Swift and Uplift!

1954
01:47:27,291 --> 01:47:28,791
Why are you so scared?

1955
01:47:28,791 --> 01:47:32,791
We used to bathe in lava like it's nothing.

1956
01:47:32,791 --> 01:47:34,541
Hot! Hot!

1957
01:47:37,083 --> 01:47:37,750
Oh no!

1958
01:47:37,750 --> 01:47:39,875
It's the true fire of Samadhi.

1959
01:47:41,791 --> 01:47:43,208
What are you looking at?

1960
01:47:43,208 --> 01:47:45,958
If anyone should eat this, it's me!

1961
01:47:48,958 --> 01:47:50,666
Yum.

1962
01:47:54,958 --> 01:47:56,291
Let go of my father!

1963
01:47:57,125 --> 01:47:57,708
Hyah!

1964
01:47:57,708 --> 01:47:58,458
Freeze!

1965
01:48:09,791 --> 01:48:11,625
What a Spirit Pearl!

1966
01:48:11,625 --> 01:48:14,958
Perfect match for the Demon Orb.

1967
01:48:16,166 --> 01:48:17,125
Ao Bing!

1968
01:48:19,458 --> 01:48:20,375
Hyah!

1969
01:48:20,625 --> 01:48:21,125
Freeze!

1970
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:33,458
Ah!

1971
01:48:33,458 --> 01:48:34,958
The Heart-Piercing Curse.

1972
01:48:35,291 --> 01:48:39,125
Since I already knew your true identities,

1973
01:48:39,125 --> 01:48:42,625
how could I not have a backup plan?

1974
01:48:44,625 --> 01:48:45,458
Impossible.

1975
01:48:45,458 --> 01:48:46,791
That curse is quite complex.

1976
01:48:46,791 --> 01:48:48,958
When did you cast it?

1977
01:48:49,708 --> 01:48:50,791
Oh...

1978
01:48:50,791 --> 01:48:53,333
That's why the Ascension Spell took so long.

1979
01:48:53,333 --> 01:48:55,416
You slipped in something.

1980
01:49:26,250 --> 01:49:27,916
You old fart!

1981
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:33,958
Even the Demon Orb

1982
01:49:33,958 --> 01:49:38,791
won't soon be able to break the Heart-Piercing Curse.

1983
01:49:38,791 --> 01:49:43,500
A thousand spikes have pierced through your nerves and veins.

1984
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:45,166
Any movement you attempt

1985
01:49:45,166 --> 01:49:47,041
will only result in your body

1986
01:49:47,041 --> 01:49:49,125
being torn apart.

1987
01:49:50,166 --> 01:49:54,291
No wonder I couldn't sense any living aura.

1988
01:49:54,750 --> 01:49:57,458
You were petrified.

1989
01:49:57,458 --> 01:49:58,833
But you being here alive again now

1990
01:49:58,833 --> 01:50:00,791
only harms Nezha.

1991
01:50:02,791 --> 01:50:04,250
The Spirit Pearl

1992
01:50:05,625 --> 01:50:07,333
and the Demon Orb

1993
01:50:07,916 --> 01:50:10,333
are precious treasures.

1994
01:50:10,333 --> 01:50:14,291
I wanted to treat you well,

1995
01:50:17,166 --> 01:50:19,708
but now you'll just serve as pills.

1996
01:50:35,250 --> 01:50:35,916
Ao Bing!

1997
01:50:36,625 --> 01:50:37,291
Father!

1998
01:50:37,291 --> 01:50:38,041
You...

1999
01:50:38,041 --> 01:50:39,375
you're still alive!

2000
01:50:39,375 --> 01:50:40,375
Ungh!

2001
01:50:40,791 --> 01:50:42,541
It's the Heart-Piercing Curse cast by Wuliang.

2002
01:50:42,541 --> 01:50:44,791
And he was the one that slaughtered Chentang Pass, framing the dragons.

2003
01:50:48,333 --> 01:50:49,125
Father,

2004
01:50:49,125 --> 01:50:50,458
Nezha was deceived.

2005
01:50:50,458 --> 01:50:51,416
Don't blame him.

2006
01:50:51,416 --> 01:50:52,791
Whatever you must do, do it to me.

2007
01:50:52,791 --> 01:50:54,125
Leave my parents out of this.

2008
01:50:59,916 --> 01:51:02,166
Killing you won't change anything.

2009
01:51:16,833 --> 01:51:19,416
We're all doomed to die here.

2010
01:51:19,416 --> 01:51:22,083
If anyone still holds grudges,

2011
01:51:23,166 --> 01:51:24,083
be my guest.

2012
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:34,291
Brother,

2013
01:51:34,291 --> 01:51:36,458
the Chan Sect has a noble reputation.

2014
01:51:36,458 --> 01:51:40,458
How could you commit such a horrible offense?

2015
01:51:40,458 --> 01:51:41,708
Don't make more mistakes!

2016
01:51:41,708 --> 01:51:43,458
Why don't you go back and confess to Master?

2017
01:51:43,833 --> 01:51:45,625
I'll plead for mercy on your behalf.

2018
01:51:45,625 --> 01:51:46,833
You...

2019
01:51:46,833 --> 01:51:49,458
Indiscriminate fool!

2020
01:51:49,458 --> 01:51:52,625
If the immortals' place in the world were secured,

2021
01:51:52,625 --> 01:51:55,416
or if you ungrateful slackers were half as

2022
01:51:55,416 --> 01:51:57,791
diligent as the demons,

2023
01:51:57,791 --> 01:52:00,625
I wouldn't have wasted this much time and effort!

2024
01:52:00,625 --> 01:52:02,791
Even if it leads to my own doom

2025
01:52:02,791 --> 01:52:04,458
and infamy,

2026
01:52:04,458 --> 01:52:08,125
I did it for the eternal dominance of Chan Sect.

2027
01:52:08,125 --> 01:52:09,166
My conscience...

2028
01:52:09,750 --> 01:52:10,500
conscience...

2029
01:52:10,833 --> 01:52:11,791
conscience...

2030
01:52:15,416 --> 01:52:17,791
My conscience is clear.

2031
01:52:20,916 --> 01:52:22,458
Another one is done.

2032
01:52:22,458 --> 01:52:24,041
I can't possibly eat any more.

2033
01:52:24,041 --> 01:52:25,125
You should try some.

2034
01:52:25,125 --> 01:52:26,166
Thanks.

2035
01:52:26,166 --> 01:52:28,625
When my fins are done, you should try some too.

2036
01:52:28,625 --> 01:52:30,208
The claws are ready as well.

2037
01:52:30,208 --> 01:52:31,791
We should swap and share.

2038
01:52:32,291 --> 01:52:33,375
What's going on?

2039
01:52:34,416 --> 01:52:36,791
My body...

2040
01:52:38,833 --> 01:52:40,041
He's become a pill!

2041
01:52:40,041 --> 01:52:41,625
I'm still so young.

2042
01:52:41,625 --> 01:52:43,000
don't want to die.

2043
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:44,666
No, let me out.

2044
01:52:44,666 --> 01:52:46,375
Help!

2045
01:52:46,375 --> 01:52:47,958
Stay calm!

2046
01:52:47,958 --> 01:52:49,958
Focus all your energy!

2047
01:52:49,958 --> 01:52:52,625
Hold on for as long as you can.

2048
01:52:59,750 --> 01:53:00,958
Son!

2049
01:53:00,958 --> 01:53:02,416
Your power is greater than mine.

2050
01:53:02,416 --> 01:53:04,000
You can get through.

2051
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,291
If you can hold out until the Heart-Piercing Curse fades,

2052
01:53:06,291 --> 01:53:08,083
you'll have a chance to escape.

2053
01:53:08,083 --> 01:53:10,500
The Heart-Piercing Curse takes at least six hours.

2054
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,291
I'm afraid...

2055
01:53:12,291 --> 01:53:13,916
I won't be able to last that long.

2056
01:53:19,875 --> 01:53:20,375
My lady.

2057
01:53:20,375 --> 01:53:20,916
Mom!

2058
01:53:20,916 --> 01:53:22,000
Wake up, mom.

2059
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Nezha, Nezha?

2060
01:53:26,041 --> 01:53:26,875
Nezha.

2061
01:53:26,875 --> 01:53:28,541
I'm here, Mom.

2062
01:53:28,541 --> 01:53:30,166
You and Dad must not give up.

2063
01:53:30,166 --> 01:53:31,541
Don't worry about us.

2064
01:53:31,541 --> 01:53:32,791
Try to

2065
01:53:32,791 --> 01:53:34,416
stay focused.

2066
01:53:34,416 --> 01:53:35,791
I'm fine, Mom.

2067
01:53:35,791 --> 01:53:37,458
I don't feel the fire.

2068
01:53:37,458 --> 01:53:39,541
Nothing kills you, kiddo.

2069
01:53:39,541 --> 01:53:42,125
If I am correct,

2070
01:53:42,125 --> 01:53:44,708
flames of the Demon Orb and the true fire of Samadhi

2071
01:53:44,708 --> 01:53:46,083
share the same origin.

2072
01:53:46,583 --> 01:53:49,916
So the Tianyuan Cauldron can't harm you.

2073
01:53:49,916 --> 01:53:50,791
That's right.

2074
01:53:50,791 --> 01:53:52,541
My mistake.

2075
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:57,333
Don't bother.

2076
01:53:57,333 --> 01:53:59,791
This is just my avatar.

2077
01:54:01,375 --> 01:54:03,166
As suspected, the Demon Orb

2078
01:54:03,166 --> 01:54:04,791
is indestructible.

2079
01:54:04,791 --> 01:54:09,958
No wonder the Supreme Lord had to destroy you with the Wrath of Heaven.

2080
01:54:14,125 --> 01:54:16,291
Nezha,

2081
01:54:16,291 --> 01:54:19,583
I see you're a good son.

2082
01:54:19,583 --> 01:54:22,000
How about I give you a chance to prove that?

2083
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:23,625
The Oblivion Pill.

2084
01:54:24,125 --> 01:54:25,791
Swallow it

2085
01:54:25,791 --> 01:54:28,250
and I'll release your parents.

2086
01:54:28,250 --> 01:54:29,375
What do you say?

2087
01:54:29,625 --> 01:54:32,125
I may be ruthless,

2088
01:54:32,125 --> 01:54:34,791
but I always keep my promises.

2089
01:54:34,791 --> 01:54:38,583
Otherwise, all those elites of the demons

2090
01:54:38,583 --> 01:54:40,375
wouldn't swear loyalty to me.

2091
01:54:40,375 --> 01:54:42,791
As long as you swallow it,

2092
01:54:42,791 --> 01:54:45,125
I swear to Heaven,

2093
01:54:45,125 --> 01:54:47,041
I won't harm your parents.

2094
01:55:01,958 --> 01:55:03,458
What are you doing?

2095
01:55:03,458 --> 01:55:06,541
Using his parents' lives to threaten a kid?

2096
01:55:06,541 --> 01:55:08,416
And you call yourself a god?

2097
01:55:08,416 --> 01:55:10,125
You aren't even worthy to be a human.

2098
01:55:12,375 --> 01:55:13,458
Nezha,

2099
01:55:13,458 --> 01:55:14,583
leave us be.

2100
01:55:14,583 --> 01:55:16,833
You must live.

2101
01:55:16,833 --> 01:55:18,791
Hold on until the Heart-Piercing Curse is broken

2102
01:55:18,791 --> 01:55:20,958
or your two brothers find you.

2103
01:55:20,958 --> 01:55:24,375
You really think I can't kill the Demon Orb?

2104
01:55:24,375 --> 01:55:26,708
It's just a matter of time.

2105
01:55:26,708 --> 01:55:28,125
Once you're dead,

2106
01:55:28,125 --> 01:55:31,833
I have a hundred ways to destroy him.

2107
01:55:36,291 --> 01:55:40,750
I just wanted to have a meaningful death.

2108
01:55:40,750 --> 01:55:44,333
Why won't you let me die?

2109
01:55:44,333 --> 01:55:47,541
Why won't you?

2110
01:55:47,541 --> 01:55:50,625
If you trade your life for ours,

2111
01:55:50,625 --> 01:55:54,708
do you think we could live in peace?

2112
01:55:56,250 --> 01:55:57,708
Nezha.

2113
01:55:57,708 --> 01:56:00,583
No, mom.

2114
01:56:00,583 --> 01:56:02,000
It'll hurt you.

2115
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:03,208
It's okay.

2116
01:56:03,208 --> 01:56:06,125
This is the end.

2117
01:56:06,125 --> 01:56:09,416
I just want to hug you one last time.

2118
01:56:09,416 --> 01:56:12,041
Mom.

2119
01:56:12,041 --> 01:56:16,208
I guess I won't get to see you grow up.

2120
01:56:16,208 --> 01:56:19,000
From now on,

2121
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,708
you'll have to walk your own path.

2122
01:57:29,791 --> 01:57:33,000
I... I'm useless.

2123
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,666
So useless.

2124
01:57:35,666 --> 01:57:38,625
I was born a demon,

2125
01:57:38,625 --> 01:57:42,333
and have always caused you pain.

2126
01:57:42,333 --> 01:57:43,708
I wanted so badly,

2127
01:57:43,708 --> 01:57:46,500
to make you proud.

2128
01:57:52,291 --> 01:57:55,791
This is all my fault.

2129
01:57:55,791 --> 01:57:57,291
I'm sorry.

2130
01:57:57,291 --> 01:57:59,958
Mom.

2131
01:57:59,958 --> 01:58:03,125
I'm sorry.

2132
01:58:03,125 --> 01:58:06,750
Every day I spent with you,

2133
01:58:06,750 --> 01:58:10,333
I was so happy.

2134
01:58:10,333 --> 01:58:14,041
I never cared

2135
01:58:14,041 --> 01:58:15,791
whether you were an immortal

2136
01:58:15,791 --> 01:58:18,291
or a demon.

2137
01:58:18,291 --> 01:58:20,791
All I know is

2138
01:58:20,791 --> 01:58:25,625
you are my son.

2139
01:58:25,625 --> 01:58:27,375
Mommy

2140
01:58:27,375 --> 01:58:29,666
will always

2141
01:58:29,666 --> 01:58:31,000
love...

2142
01:59:11,125 --> 01:59:12,708
Nezha, stay calm!

2143
01:59:12,708 --> 01:59:13,625
Stop!

2144
01:59:13,625 --> 01:59:15,333
Your body will be torn apart!

2145
01:59:58,291 --> 02:00:01,625
The True Fire of Samadhi has compensated for

2146
02:00:01,625 --> 02:00:03,791
the fire needed for the body restoration.

2147
02:00:03,791 --> 02:00:05,916
Nezha's physical form

2148
02:00:07,125 --> 02:00:09,791
is complete now!

2149
02:00:24,375 --> 02:00:25,666
Dad,

2150
02:00:26,458 --> 02:00:27,583
take care of Mom.

2151
02:00:40,291 --> 02:00:42,708
Help me break the cauldron!

2152
02:01:15,208 --> 02:01:15,916
Oh no!

2153
02:01:15,916 --> 02:01:18,208
They are absorbing the energy of the Tianyuan Cauldron!

2154
02:01:19,416 --> 02:01:22,041
Roota Maxima!

2155
02:01:46,833 --> 02:01:48,791
Demon Hunters, on my command,

2156
02:01:48,791 --> 02:01:50,083
march!

2157
02:02:45,250 --> 02:02:46,208
Father,

2158
02:02:46,208 --> 02:02:47,791
you need to save your energy for self-protection.

2159
02:02:47,791 --> 02:02:49,166
We've been backing down

2160
02:02:49,166 --> 02:02:50,833
for far too long.

2161
02:02:50,833 --> 02:02:52,250
We thought if we gave everything,

2162
02:02:52,250 --> 02:02:54,666
then Wuliang would let us live.

2163
02:02:54,666 --> 02:02:57,583
But in the end, they still want us dead.

2164
02:02:57,583 --> 02:03:00,125
If that's what they want,

2165
02:03:00,125 --> 02:03:03,416
then we'll fight them to the death!

2166
02:03:03,416 --> 02:03:05,708
Yes, let's fight!

2167
02:03:05,708 --> 02:03:09,125
Fight! Fight! Fight!

2168
02:03:19,291 --> 02:03:21,708
We can't let them out!

2169
02:04:08,291 --> 02:04:09,791
Do not give up!

2170
02:04:09,791 --> 02:04:11,791
Hang in there!

2171
02:04:35,875 --> 02:04:38,291
Make it...

2172
02:04:38,291 --> 02:04:41,625
break!

2173
02:05:31,541 --> 02:05:32,625
The cauldron!

2174
02:05:32,625 --> 02:05:34,041
My cauldron!

2175
02:05:34,041 --> 02:05:37,375
There goes the foundation of Chan Sect!

2176
02:06:32,208 --> 02:06:35,791
Kill all these monsters!

2177
02:06:40,708 --> 02:06:42,666
Attack!

2178
02:07:16,958 --> 02:07:20,416
You ungrateful traitors.

2179
02:07:20,416 --> 02:07:21,833
Can't tell right from wrong!

2180
02:07:34,583 --> 02:07:36,958
Roaring Dragon Waves!

2181
02:07:46,833 --> 02:07:49,833
So those two minions of his are monsters too.

2182
02:07:49,833 --> 02:07:51,625
Demons, immortals,

2183
02:07:51,625 --> 02:07:54,125
it's all part of your trickery!

2184
02:07:54,958 --> 02:07:56,791
You despicable lowlife.

2185
02:07:56,791 --> 02:07:59,416
How dare you oppose me!

2186
02:08:22,458 --> 02:08:26,125
Witness my true powers!

2187
02:10:20,208 --> 02:10:22,000
I'll give you two

2188
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:23,958
one last chance because I value talent.

2189
02:10:23,958 --> 02:10:25,541
Surrender now

2190
02:10:25,541 --> 02:10:27,458
and I'll grant you immortality.

2191
02:10:27,458 --> 02:10:29,916
Who cares about immortality?

2192
02:10:29,916 --> 02:10:32,125
I'm all demon.

2193
02:10:32,125 --> 02:10:33,375
So what?

2194
02:10:36,708 --> 02:10:38,791
You claim to be a guiding light,

2195
02:10:38,791 --> 02:10:40,375
but all you do is bully the weak,

2196
02:10:40,375 --> 02:10:42,625
and bring chaos to the world.

2197
02:10:42,625 --> 02:10:45,333
You are the real evil!

2198
02:10:53,416 --> 02:10:54,916
Ignorant fools,

2199
02:10:54,916 --> 02:10:56,791
the immortals rule the world.

2200
02:10:56,791 --> 02:10:59,875
Siding with the powerful is the only way out.

2201
02:10:59,875 --> 02:11:01,958
Either accept that or

2202
02:11:01,958 --> 02:11:04,458
you'll have no place to hide.

2203
02:11:04,458 --> 02:11:06,250
If there is no way ahead,

2204
02:11:06,250 --> 02:11:08,416
then I will carve out a path!

2205
02:11:11,625 --> 02:11:14,291
If the world won't accommodate me,

2206
02:11:14,291 --> 02:11:18,125
I will turn the world upside down!

2207
02:11:28,125 --> 02:11:28,750
Master!

2208
02:11:30,625 --> 02:11:32,875
My face...

2209
02:11:32,875 --> 02:11:33,750
You...

2210
02:11:33,750 --> 02:11:37,375
You fools broke my Ageless Spell!

2211
02:11:37,625 --> 02:11:39,791
Old fart.

2212
02:11:51,625 --> 02:11:54,708
Ba... back to the palace.

2213
02:12:06,500 --> 02:12:08,291
Wait for me!

2214
02:12:50,916 --> 02:12:52,625
My father plans to lead the dragons

2215
02:12:52,625 --> 02:12:54,375
deep into the ocean to hide away.

2216
02:12:54,375 --> 02:12:55,916
Now that your identity is exposed,

2217
02:12:55,916 --> 02:12:57,458
why don't you come with us?

2218
02:12:58,000 --> 02:12:58,833
No.

2219
02:12:59,750 --> 02:13:01,208
I always used to hide

2220
02:13:01,833 --> 02:13:03,250
and run away,

2221
02:13:03,250 --> 02:13:05,541
until there was nowhere to left to go.

2222
02:13:05,541 --> 02:13:08,333
Now I finally know how to face this world.

2223
02:13:08,333 --> 02:13:10,333
Wuliang is one of the most powerful immortals

2224
02:13:10,333 --> 02:13:12,666
and is trusted by the Supreme Lord.

2225
02:13:12,666 --> 02:13:14,416
He may not fall so easily.

2226
02:13:14,416 --> 02:13:16,625
Plus, immortals and demons walk different paths,

2227
02:13:16,625 --> 02:13:18,708
like water and fire.

2228
02:13:18,708 --> 02:13:20,458
Immortals, demons...

2229
02:13:20,458 --> 02:13:24,083
Those are just excuses for controlling those who are different.

2230
02:13:25,041 --> 02:13:26,583
So what?

2231
02:13:26,583 --> 02:13:29,708
You think you can change things?

2232
02:13:33,541 --> 02:13:35,125
I want to try.

2233
02:13:37,458 --> 02:13:39,666
Perhaps I'm too old

2234
02:13:39,666 --> 02:13:43,125
to fight against the world.

2235
02:13:43,125 --> 02:13:44,041
Ao Bing.

2236
02:14:19,708 --> 02:14:21,125
I know that

2237
02:14:21,125 --> 02:14:22,958
once you've made up your mind,

2238
02:14:22,958 --> 02:14:25,041
you'll always follow through.

2239
02:14:25,916 --> 02:14:27,166
My son,

2240
02:14:27,166 --> 02:14:28,750
in the past,

2241
02:14:28,750 --> 02:14:30,833
I put too large a burden on you.

2242
02:14:30,833 --> 02:14:31,916
I never even

2243
02:14:31,916 --> 02:14:34,083
listened closely to you.

2244
02:14:34,083 --> 02:14:35,791
I apologize.

2245
02:14:36,416 --> 02:14:41,125
I only wanted to use my experience to give you a good life.

2246
02:14:41,125 --> 02:14:42,291
But now I see,

2247
02:14:42,291 --> 02:14:44,041
the experience of the older generation

2248
02:14:44,041 --> 02:14:45,583
is but the past,

2249
02:14:45,583 --> 02:14:47,791
and may not be right for you.

2250
02:14:49,125 --> 02:14:52,291
You must walk your own path.

2251
02:14:52,791 --> 02:14:54,791
From now on,

2252
02:14:54,791 --> 02:14:57,541
follow your heart.

2253
02:15:28,458 --> 02:15:30,291
I knew you'd come back.

2254
02:15:30,291 --> 02:15:31,625
How?

2255
02:15:32,458 --> 02:15:34,208
Because we are both too young.

2256
02:15:37,625 --> 02:15:40,458
Too naive to know the limits of the world.

2257
02:17:32,875 --> 02:17:33,916
Master.

2258
02:17:33,916 --> 02:17:35,208
Your face...

2259
02:17:35,208 --> 02:17:36,833
Don't worry.

2260
02:17:36,833 --> 02:17:39,041
Crana has helped apply some medicine.

2261
02:17:39,333 --> 02:17:40,458
With Tianyuan Cauldron destroyed,

2262
02:17:40,458 --> 02:17:42,458
Chan Sect is not the great power it once was.

2263
02:17:42,458 --> 02:17:45,208
We've committed a grave sin.

2264
02:17:45,208 --> 02:17:49,416
We must act before the Supreme Lord returns from seclusion.

2265
02:17:49,416 --> 02:17:50,041
Come,

2266
02:17:50,041 --> 02:17:51,833
let's go see him.

2267
02:17:52,083 --> 02:17:54,833
Is the holding cell concealed well?

2268
02:17:54,833 --> 02:17:56,458
Nobody else can come in here.

2269
02:17:56,458 --> 02:17:58,333
The cell inside is shielded with a spell.

2270
02:17:58,333 --> 02:17:59,291
The door can only be opened

2271
02:17:59,291 --> 02:18:01,541
by you and one other guard only.

2272
02:18:01,541 --> 02:18:02,750
Mmm.

2273
02:18:09,458 --> 02:18:10,875
Slacking off.

2274
02:18:10,875 --> 02:18:12,333
Snoozing on the job.

2275
02:18:17,250 --> 02:18:18,458
What is going on?

2276
02:18:18,458 --> 02:18:19,541
This door

2277
02:18:19,541 --> 02:18:20,583
uses facial recognition.

2278
02:18:20,583 --> 02:18:22,583
Your appearance has changed,

2279
02:18:22,583 --> 02:18:24,875
and your face will need to be re-entered.

2280
02:18:24,875 --> 02:18:26,041
Redo it.

2281
02:18:53,333 --> 02:18:55,625
You dare to laugh at me?

2282
02:18:55,625 --> 02:18:57,458
I curse you to sleep for ten years.

2283
02:19:04,750 --> 02:19:05,958
Are you suffering,

2284
02:19:05,958 --> 02:19:07,875
Brother?

2285
02:19:09,416 --> 02:19:11,625
Brother is the one who has suffered.

2286
02:19:11,625 --> 02:19:14,875
Who has... has beat you up like this?

2287
02:19:14,875 --> 02:19:15,958
Hmph.

2288
02:19:15,958 --> 02:19:20,708
Do you know why I originally recruited you?

2289
02:19:20,708 --> 02:19:24,208
I wanted your demon identity

2290
02:19:24,208 --> 02:19:26,458
so that in the Deification War,

2291
02:19:26,458 --> 02:19:30,333
I could entrust you with important tasks.

2292
02:19:30,333 --> 02:19:31,291
You're delusional!

2293
02:19:33,958 --> 02:19:36,458
[Shen Zhengdao]
Father

2294
02:19:36,458 --> 02:19:37,791
Don't worry.

2295
02:19:37,791 --> 02:19:39,916
He's still breathing.

2296
02:19:39,916 --> 02:19:43,208
If you will let me place a curse on you,

2297
02:19:43,208 --> 02:19:45,958
then your father can enjoy

2298
02:19:45,958 --> 02:19:48,875
a peaceful life at Yu Xu Palace.

2299
02:19:51,333 --> 02:19:53,291
The two people you've asked for are here.

2300
02:19:53,291 --> 02:19:55,291
Think carefully about it.

2301
02:20:02,875 --> 02:20:04,125
Hmm?

2302
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,666
The medicine from earlier has taken effect.

2303
02:20:07,666 --> 02:20:08,708
Then what can we do?

2304
02:20:08,708 --> 02:20:10,666
Who else can open the door?

2305
02:20:16,666 --> 02:20:18,000
Ten years...

2306
02:20:25,458 --> 02:20:27,083
Jinzha of Five Dragon Mountain, Yunxiao Cave.

2307
02:20:27,083 --> 02:20:27,583
[Jinzha]
Jinzha of Five Dragon Mountain, Yunxiao Cave.

2308
02:20:27,583 --> 02:20:28,166
[Jinzha]
Muzha of Jiugong Mountain, White Egret Cave.

2309
02:20:28,166 --> 02:20:30,000
[Muzha]
Muzha of Jiugong Mountain, White Egret Cave.

2310
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:31,458
Responding the summons to return to palace.

2311
02:20:37,166 --> 02:20:38,166
Master.

2312
02:20:38,166 --> 02:20:39,291
Brace yourself.

2313
02:20:44,166 --> 02:20:46,375
That should be enough.

2314
02:20:52,250 --> 02:20:53,500
I think

2315
02:20:53,500 --> 02:20:54,958
the left eye isn't swollen enough.

2316
02:20:55,291 --> 02:20:56,625
The right cheek needs adjustment.

2317
02:20:59,250 --> 02:21:00,208
Wait!

2318
02:21:00,708 --> 02:21:02,458
Were you two laughing just now?

2319
02:21:02,458 --> 02:21:03,416
I wouldn't dare!

2320
02:21:03,416 --> 02:21:04,291
Master is suffering

2321
02:21:04,291 --> 02:21:06,375
and my heart hurts a hundred times more.

2322
02:21:06,375 --> 02:21:06,833
Really?

2323
02:21:06,833 --> 02:21:08,000
Absolutely true.

2324
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:09,166
Heaven and earth bears witness.

2325
02:21:14,041 --> 02:21:16,041
Okay, that's enough.

2326
02:21:26,958 --> 02:21:28,208
I think

2327
02:21:28,208 --> 02:21:29,291
we overdid it.

2328
02:21:29,291 --> 02:21:30,166
What?

2329
02:21:30,166 --> 02:21:31,000
It's alright.

2330
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:32,500
Apply some medicine and we'll try again.

2331
02:21:33,541 --> 02:21:35,583
Master, you are one who accomplishes great things.

2332
02:21:35,583 --> 02:21:37,375
This is for the fate of the Chan Sect.

2333
02:21:37,375 --> 02:21:38,083
Let's try a few more times.

2334
02:21:38,083 --> 02:21:39,375
We will get it right eventually.

2335
02:21:39,375 --> 02:21:39,916
Catch him!

2336
02:21:39,916 --> 02:21:40,625
Don't let him run!

2337
02:21:40,625 --> 02:21:41,083
Hurry,

2338
02:21:41,083 --> 02:21:42,041
put on the medicine quickly!

2339
02:21:42,041 --> 02:21:43,291
Medicine!

2340
02:21:43,291 --> 02:21:45,333
Let me go!
