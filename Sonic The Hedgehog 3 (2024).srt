1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000


2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000


3
00:01:05,848 --> 00:01:08,764
Oh, yes! You got donuts.

4
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:10,766
I already ate
all the Boston Cream.

5
00:01:11,506 --> 00:01:12,507
Kyle!

6
00:01:18,165 --> 00:01:20,428
This place
gives me the creeps.

7
00:01:21,603 --> 00:01:24,606
Relax. That Popsicle
hasn't moved in 50 years.

8
00:01:56,812 --> 00:01:58,161
Is that normal?

9
00:01:58,335 --> 00:01:59,336
No.

10
00:02:01,991 --> 00:02:03,993
Someone's hacking the system.What?

11
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:05,647
The containment tank
is destabilizing.

12
00:02:06,343 --> 00:02:07,518
He's waking up.

13
00:03:44,963 --> 00:03:46,617
We need more guys.

14
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,576
That is all the guys.

15
00:04:23,741 --> 00:04:25,439
Wait a second.

16
00:04:25,613 --> 00:04:27,397
I thought
we were going tubing.

17
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:29,704
Hold on, hold on.
Is this a race?

18
00:04:29,878 --> 00:04:31,358
You're going down!

19
00:04:31,532 --> 00:04:33,534
It is my destiny
to claim the throne

20
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,623
of Family Champion, hedgehog.

21
00:04:35,797 --> 00:04:37,015
Cute.

22
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:38,452
Are you sure
you want to challenge

23
00:04:38,626 --> 00:04:40,192
the fastest creature
in the universe?

24
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:42,282
I mean, that's kind of
my whole brand.

25
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,414
Okay, Tom and Maddie,

26
00:04:44,588 --> 00:04:46,242
count us down.Right!

27
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:48,549
Don't worry,
a little sibling rivalry is healthy.

28
00:04:48,723 --> 00:04:50,725
Me and my brothers used to
do this kind of thing all the time.

29
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:53,336
Tom, your brothers are lunatics
and neither of them were born with the power

30
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,817
to trigger a global
cataclysmic event.

31
00:04:55,991 --> 00:04:57,514
That's a fair point.
Did you hear that, boys?

32
00:04:57,688 --> 00:04:58,994
No cataclysmic events, okay?

33
00:04:59,168 --> 00:05:00,561
Let's keep this
cataclysmic-less.

34
00:05:00,735 --> 00:05:02,693
Ten-four!Understood,
Lord of the Donuts.

35
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:05,566
Then on your marks, get set...

36
00:05:06,218 --> 00:05:07,263
go!

37
00:05:08,264 --> 00:05:09,700
And way out in front,

38
00:05:09,874 --> 00:05:11,572
to the surprise
of absolutely no one,

39
00:05:11,746 --> 00:05:13,661
it's the Blue Blur,
the Red-Shoed Rocket,

40
00:05:13,835 --> 00:05:16,446
the one, the only--Come on, Sonic!

41
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,883
Catch up! Yeah!

42
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:21,059
What in the what, now?

43
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:23,018
I am also defeating you,
hedgehog!

44
00:05:23,192 --> 00:05:25,194
Seriously?
All right, you know what?

45
00:05:25,368 --> 00:05:27,109
Time to light the afterburners.

46
00:05:28,371 --> 00:05:30,460
Look! It's a bird! It's a plane!

47
00:05:30,634 --> 00:05:32,767
It's Air Hedgehog!

48
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,349
Yes! I did it! I...

49
00:05:50,872 --> 00:05:52,090
lost?

50
00:05:52,264 --> 00:05:54,005
How is that even possible?
I do not lose.

51
00:05:54,179 --> 00:05:56,138
I am also defeating you,
hedgehog.

52
00:05:56,312 --> 00:05:58,880
Okay, okay, I get it, man.
No need to rub it in.

53
00:05:59,054 --> 00:06:02,971
Come on, Sonic!
Catch up! Yeah!

54
00:06:03,145 --> 00:06:05,495
Wait, what's going on?

55
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:07,976
Why are you guys acting like...

56
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,848
holograms!

57
00:06:11,022 --> 00:06:12,459
Which means...

58
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:15,679
I remain the undefeated
speed champion of all time!

59
00:06:15,853 --> 00:06:17,768
Yes!
And the crowd goes wild!

60
00:06:17,942 --> 00:06:19,640
But also, what's going on?

61
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:26,603
Surprise!

62
00:06:26,777 --> 00:06:29,214
But wait a sec, you guys...
...what is all this?

63
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,826
"Happy Bea Arthur Day"?

64
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,872
Oh, it's
"Happy B-Earth-Day."

65
00:06:35,046 --> 00:06:37,179
Today's the anniversary of
the day you came to Earth, bud.

66
00:06:37,353 --> 00:06:39,137
It's your "Earth Day Birthday."

67
00:06:39,311 --> 00:06:41,009
So the race
was just a distraction,

68
00:06:41,183 --> 00:06:42,663
which I totally didn't fall for,
by the way--

69
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:43,881
Good try, though--

70
00:06:44,055 --> 00:06:46,014
so you could throw a party
for me?

71
00:06:46,188 --> 00:06:48,364
Today, we honor you, hedgehog.

72
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:51,541
If it wasn't for you, none of us
would be here right now.

73
00:06:51,715 --> 00:06:53,238
The boys are right, bud.

74
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,718
You know, the day you came
to this planet

75
00:06:54,892 --> 00:06:56,459
is the day all our lives
changed forever.

76
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:57,765
And we became a family.

77
00:06:57,939 --> 00:06:59,593
You stole my hoomans.

78
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:03,118
You guys, I don't...
I don't know what to say.

79
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:06,730
Except... let's party!

80
00:07:06,904 --> 00:07:08,819
All right!Yeah!

81
00:07:08,993 --> 00:07:11,909
It's now on
till the break of dawn!Toga! Toga!

82
00:07:15,086 --> 00:07:17,872
Thanks for the surprise party.
It really means a lot to me.

83
00:07:18,046 --> 00:07:19,830
Ah, you deserve it, pal.

84
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:23,443
No way. Is that...

85
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,184
What? Dude...

86
00:07:26,358 --> 00:07:28,448
Could you just for once
walk at my speed?

87
00:07:33,496 --> 00:07:34,889
Whoa.

88
00:07:35,063 --> 00:07:36,630
Sonic!

89
00:07:36,804 --> 00:07:39,459
This is your--Yep. My old cave.

90
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:42,897
Oh, man.
I can't believe this is where you lived all those years.

91
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:46,466
Hey! My state-of-the-art
security system!

92
00:07:48,293 --> 00:07:50,165
Still works.

93
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:51,906
Hey, bud.

94
00:07:53,255 --> 00:07:54,474
What's this?

95
00:07:57,302 --> 00:08:01,176
Wow. You know, I drew that
on my first night on Earth.

96
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,352
I wanted to remember
where I came from.

97
00:08:05,615 --> 00:08:06,921
I still miss her.

98
00:08:08,357 --> 00:08:10,620
You think Longclaw
would be proud of me?

99
00:08:11,578 --> 00:08:13,318
I know she would, pal.

100
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,539
Because even though you lost her
at such a young age,

101
00:08:16,713 --> 00:08:19,847
you didn't let your pain
change who you are...

102
00:08:20,717 --> 00:08:21,718
in here.

103
00:08:23,677 --> 00:08:25,505
Yeah. In my lungs.

104
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:28,812
Or your heart.Heart, right.

105
00:08:28,986 --> 00:08:30,597
Yeah, makes more sense.
Not lungs, heart.

106
00:08:30,771 --> 00:08:32,120
That's the thing
about life, Sonic,

107
00:08:32,294 --> 00:08:34,992
it's all about the choices
we make.

108
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,646
You're gonna
make some good ones and,

109
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,257
knowing you,
you're gonna make some bad ones.

110
00:08:39,431 --> 00:08:40,432
But...

111
00:08:41,912 --> 00:08:44,480
as long as you remember
to listen to your heart,

112
00:08:44,654 --> 00:08:46,874
you're gonna
make the right choice when it matters the most.

113
00:08:47,048 --> 00:08:48,615
Thanks.

114
00:08:48,789 --> 00:08:50,486
I don't know
what I'd do without you.

115
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,837
<i>I'd probably be </i>
<i>a totally different hedgehog.</i>

116
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,024
2024?

117
00:09:07,198 --> 00:09:10,550
I've been trapped for 50 years?

118
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,556
Move, move!Take positions!

119
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,472
Get on the ground now!

120
00:09:21,822 --> 00:09:23,432
We've got you surrounded!

121
00:09:24,651 --> 00:09:28,568
Why won't you leave me alone?

122
00:09:28,742 --> 00:09:29,569
Take him down!

123
00:09:34,312 --> 00:09:37,141
I have dishonored
my marshmallow.

124
00:09:37,315 --> 00:09:40,884
It's really just a question
of temperature and distance.

125
00:09:41,058 --> 00:09:42,799
It's not a competition.

126
00:09:44,801 --> 00:09:45,715
This is so nice.

127
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:48,326
Peace.Quiet.

128
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,632
Finally.

129
00:09:50,241 --> 00:09:51,547
Finally!

130
00:10:01,992 --> 00:10:05,561
Hey! We're trying to have
a family moment down here!

131
00:10:18,356 --> 00:10:20,707
What did we do?Or what did they do?

132
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:22,012
What did you do?

133
00:10:22,186 --> 00:10:23,710
I don't know.
I do a lot of stuff.

134
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,543
Mr. and Mrs. Wachowski.

135
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:33,589
Aliens.

136
00:10:33,763 --> 00:10:35,765
"Aliens"? Excuse me?

137
00:10:35,939 --> 00:10:37,288
It's not like we're
from different planet--

138
00:10:37,462 --> 00:10:39,421
Oh, yeah, we are.
I guess we are aliens.

139
00:10:39,595 --> 00:10:40,640
Please continue.

140
00:10:40,814 --> 00:10:41,902
I'm Director Rockwell.

141
00:10:42,076 --> 00:10:43,468
There is a very
dangerous situation

142
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,862
unfolding right now
in Tokyo.

143
00:10:46,036 --> 00:10:50,040
Commander Walters
is requesting Team Sonic's immediate assistance.

144
00:10:50,214 --> 00:10:52,695
"Team Sonic"?
Who picked that name?

145
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:55,045
Love it!
Ten out of ten, no notes.

146
00:10:55,219 --> 00:10:57,526
Tom and Maddie,
put the s'mores on ice

147
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,443
because Team Sonic
is off to save the day!

148
00:11:08,232 --> 00:11:09,669
Remember,

149
00:11:09,843 --> 00:11:12,410
make good choices!

150
00:11:25,902 --> 00:11:28,949
Good evening and welcome
to Tails Air flight 1012.

151
00:11:29,123 --> 00:11:31,908
We're looking at
an on-time arrival into Tokyo.

152
00:11:32,082 --> 00:11:34,171
Okay, Captain, we got
a rogue alien on the loose.

153
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:35,869
How do we find him?

154
00:11:38,132 --> 00:11:40,134
Uh, start with
the giant fireball?

155
00:11:40,308 --> 00:11:42,702
I love it! Let's start
with the giant fireball.

156
00:11:45,443 --> 00:11:48,098
Finally, some action!

157
00:11:48,272 --> 00:11:50,144
Okay, time to gear up.

158
00:11:50,318 --> 00:11:53,974
Titanium handcuffs,
completely indestructible.

159
00:11:54,148 --> 00:11:56,150
I don't need
your silly gizmos, fox.

160
00:11:56,324 --> 00:11:58,239
And you know why?
Because I am...

161
00:11:58,413 --> 00:12:00,197
...one million
percent muscle.

162
00:12:00,371 --> 00:12:02,460
Yes, good.
You've been listening.

163
00:12:02,634 --> 00:12:04,680
We're over the drop zone.

164
00:12:04,854 --> 00:12:07,335
All right, here we go.
Showtime!

165
00:12:09,946 --> 00:12:11,731
Now, look, we don't know
if it's Godzilla

166
00:12:11,905 --> 00:12:12,949
or Hello Kitty down there,

167
00:12:13,123 --> 00:12:14,734
but as long
as we stick together,

168
00:12:14,908 --> 00:12:16,561
there is nothing
we can't handle.

169
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,433
"Team Sonic" on three.

170
00:12:18,607 --> 00:12:21,088
One, two, three.

171
00:12:21,262 --> 00:12:22,480
Team...

172
00:12:22,654 --> 00:12:23,917
Sonic!Knuckles!

173
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,618
Talk about low-budget flights.
No food or movies?

174
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:31,359
We're out of here!

175
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:56,645
What happened here?

176
00:12:56,819 --> 00:12:58,734
Looks like GUN
got their butts kicked.

177
00:12:58,908 --> 00:13:01,215
Keep your eyes open.
Tails, anything?

178
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:03,913
Whoa! These energy readings
are off the charts!

179
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:08,004
Look out!

180
00:13:09,353 --> 00:13:12,704
One... million...
percent.

181
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:28,416
Whoa! Are you guys seeing this?

182
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:31,158
He looks just like you.Impossible!

183
00:13:31,332 --> 00:13:32,986
You're a colorful bunch.

184
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,554
Um, excuse me.
Why do you look like me?

185
00:13:36,728 --> 00:13:38,121
I don't look like you.

186
00:13:38,295 --> 00:13:41,124
You look like me!
Why do you look like me?

187
00:13:41,298 --> 00:13:44,998
Hey, you know what?
I'll ask the questions, new hedgehog!

188
00:13:45,172 --> 00:13:47,174
Who are you?
Why do you look like me?

189
00:13:47,348 --> 00:13:49,176
This is a waste of time.

190
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,961
Walk away,
before you get hurt.

191
00:13:52,135 --> 00:13:53,745
Whoa, whoa, easy, buddy.

192
00:13:55,051 --> 00:13:56,792
We don't want to fight you.

193
00:13:56,966 --> 00:13:59,664
Actually, Sonic,
I would like to fight.

194
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,275
Not now.

195
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:03,190
Why don't you stop throwing cars
at us for a second

196
00:14:03,364 --> 00:14:04,800
and come down here to talk?

197
00:14:04,974 --> 00:14:07,542
You jumped
out of a GUN helicopter.

198
00:14:07,716 --> 00:14:09,674
There's nothing
to talk about.

199
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,720
All right, then. Enough!

200
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:13,113
Knuckles, no!

201
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:15,855
Let us talk with our fists!

202
00:14:30,695 --> 00:14:31,871
Knuckles!

203
00:14:32,045 --> 00:14:34,221
Knuckles!
Knuckles, are you okay?

204
00:14:34,395 --> 00:14:35,613
No, not really. Ow!

205
00:14:38,181 --> 00:14:39,704
Who is this guy?

206
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,054
He is much more impressive

207
00:14:41,228 --> 00:14:43,056
than the hedgehog
I fought previously.

208
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,319
Dude,
I'm standing right here.

209
00:14:45,493 --> 00:14:48,888
Now, come on!
He can't take us all at once.

210
00:14:49,062 --> 00:14:50,846
Ow!

211
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,422
Okay,
he took us all at once.

212
00:15:01,596 --> 00:15:02,553
Weakling.

213
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,124
Don't try to follow me.

214
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,043
Sonic, I know that look.

215
00:15:14,217 --> 00:15:16,045
Going after him
is a bad idea.

216
00:15:16,219 --> 00:15:18,482
When has that ever stopped me?

217
00:15:22,095 --> 00:15:24,358
I got to ask,
one hedgehog to another,

218
00:15:24,532 --> 00:15:25,576
who does your highlights?

219
00:15:34,411 --> 00:15:37,806
Hey! Dangerously weaving
through traffic is my thing!

220
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:45,814
Coming through!

221
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,299
Why are you running away?
We were just getting started.

222
00:15:54,475 --> 00:15:55,824
The more you talk,

223
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:57,782
the harder
I want to hit you.

224
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:02,874
Watch out!

225
00:16:04,311 --> 00:16:06,269
Ugh, I'm gonna throw up!

226
00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:10,708
Yeah, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

227
00:16:13,146 --> 00:16:14,277
Yah!

228
00:16:51,358 --> 00:16:55,231
1.21 gigawatts.

229
00:16:58,843 --> 00:17:00,976
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!

230
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:01,890
Sonic!

231
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:03,239
Are you okay?

232
00:17:03,413 --> 00:17:05,328
I'm fine, guys.
And before you ask,

233
00:17:05,502 --> 00:17:07,374
I handcuffed myself
for tactical reasons

234
00:17:07,548 --> 00:17:09,289
that I do not have time
to explain.

235
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:11,334
You shouldn't have gone off
on your own.

236
00:17:11,508 --> 00:17:13,206
We're supposed to be a team.

237
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,599
Sorry, buddy.
I'm still working on this teamwork thing.

238
00:17:15,773 --> 00:17:17,297
So now what?

239
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:19,647
Well, I'm not jumping
out of any more helicopters

240
00:17:19,821 --> 00:17:21,823
until we get some answers
from GUN.

241
00:17:21,997 --> 00:17:23,564
We need somewhere to regroup.

242
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:26,915
I know just the place.

243
00:17:37,447 --> 00:17:39,188
<i>Hai, chiizu.</i>

244
00:17:39,362 --> 00:17:40,624
It's an ambush!

245
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:42,800
You'll never take us alive,
foul beasts!

246
00:17:42,974 --> 00:17:45,325
Calm down, Knuckles.
This is a Chao Garden.

247
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:48,589
One of the top ten must-see
spots in all of Tokyo!

248
00:17:48,763 --> 00:17:50,678
It's a perfect place
for us to blend in.

249
00:17:50,852 --> 00:17:52,506
Are you Detective Pikachu?

250
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,116
Yes, he is!

251
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:57,250
He does
look like a Pokémon.

252
00:17:57,424 --> 00:17:58,381
"Pika, pika!"

253
00:17:58,555 --> 00:18:00,340
Commander Walters!

254
00:18:00,514 --> 00:18:02,298
Sonic.

255
00:18:02,472 --> 00:18:05,214
Thank God you're all okay.
I'm sure you have questions.

256
00:18:05,388 --> 00:18:08,087
Just a big ticked-off
red and black one.

257
00:18:08,261 --> 00:18:09,653
Who was that guy?

258
00:18:09,827 --> 00:18:12,526
Shadow's story
began a lot like yours, Sonic.

259
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,485
But where you found family
and friends on this planet,

260
00:18:15,659 --> 00:18:19,185
Shadow found only pain and loss.

261
00:18:19,924 --> 00:18:22,275
<i>It begins over 50 years ago,</i>

262
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:25,582
<i>with a meteor crash </i>
<i>in a quiet corner of Oklahoma.</i>

263
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:29,369
<i>The meteorite contained</i>
<i>a life-form.</i>

264
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,895
<i>The ultimate life-form.</i>

265
00:18:35,897 --> 00:18:38,378
<i>Shadow's power--</i>
<i>his "chaos energy"--</i>

266
00:18:38,552 --> 00:18:41,555
<i>went far beyond</i>
<i>any living creature.</i>

267
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,734
<i>The scientist</i>
<i>who discovered him</i> <i>believed this power</i>

268
00:18:46,908 --> 00:18:49,084
<i>would usher in a new era</i>
<i>for humanity.</i>

269
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:53,741
<i>But Shadow's power</i>
<i>proved too dangerous.</i>

270
00:18:56,657 --> 00:18:58,659
<i>A terrible accident</i>
<i>destroyed the lab,</i>

271
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,096
<i>taking human lives with it.</i>

272
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:05,535
<i>The project leader</i>
<i>was blamed for the incident</i> <i>and imprisoned.</i>

273
00:19:05,709 --> 00:19:07,363
<i>With the program canceled...</i>

274
00:19:07,537 --> 00:19:10,497
<i>...Shadow was a loose end </i>
<i>no one knew how to deal with.</i>

275
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:13,674
<i>Too dangerous</i>
<i>to be walking free,</i>

276
00:19:13,848 --> 00:19:16,198
<i>too valuable to destroy.</i>

277
00:19:17,286 --> 00:19:19,462
<i>So I had him placed</i>
<i>into stasis...</i>

278
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,163
<i>indefinitely.</i>

279
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,255
Wait a second. If Shadow's
been on ice for 50 years,

280
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:31,692
someone had to help him escape.True.

281
00:19:31,866 --> 00:19:33,520
But there's only a few people
in the world

282
00:19:33,694 --> 00:19:35,565
who even know
of Shadow's existence.

283
00:19:51,668 --> 00:19:54,105
A live show? Yeah!

284
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:04,420
Get down!

285
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,393
Egg drones?

286
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:23,265
But Robotnik
is supposed to be dead!

287
00:20:34,058 --> 00:20:36,322
Konnichi-what?

288
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:01,347
I'm sorry, we already had
our big motorcycle chase for the evening.

289
00:21:06,003 --> 00:21:06,961
Commander Walters!

290
00:21:08,571 --> 00:21:10,617
Commander Walters,
are you okay?

291
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:12,793
Sonic...

292
00:21:15,404 --> 00:21:16,536
...take this.

293
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,755
What is it?A key...

294
00:21:19,974 --> 00:21:22,542
to the most powerful weapon
GUN has ever built.

295
00:21:22,716 --> 00:21:25,240
You're the only one I trust
to keep it safe.

296
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,591
Commander Walters...

297
00:21:37,426 --> 00:21:38,906
Alpha team, fan out!

298
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,691
Do we have eyes?

299
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:43,345
Secure the perimeter!

300
00:21:46,653 --> 00:21:48,002
Medevac is en route.

301
00:21:51,832 --> 00:21:53,312
His launch key is missing.

302
00:22:00,536 --> 00:22:02,756
I knew they couldn't be trusted.

303
00:22:06,803 --> 00:22:08,239
Why are we
running from GUN?

304
00:22:08,414 --> 00:22:09,893
Aren't we on the same team?

305
00:22:10,067 --> 00:22:11,330
Until we get
more information,

306
00:22:11,504 --> 00:22:13,201
we're not trusting anyone.

307
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,072
Follow me.Get it... off!

308
00:22:32,786 --> 00:22:34,788
Hold it right there,
Tokyo Drift!

309
00:22:34,962 --> 00:22:36,355
Who are you?

310
00:22:39,227 --> 00:22:41,577
It's the Goat Milker!

311
00:22:41,751 --> 00:22:44,014
"It's the Goat Milker!"

312
00:22:44,188 --> 00:22:46,234
Relax.
I'm not here to fight.

313
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:49,455
Then why are you here?And why did you free Shadow?

314
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:51,544
Are you kidding?

315
00:22:51,718 --> 00:22:55,330
The last thing we want
is more super-powered hedgehogs running around.

316
00:22:55,504 --> 00:22:57,463
The doctor had nothing
to do with it.

317
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,988
And I can prove it.

318
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,005
Please,

319
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:19,223
join me in the crab.

320
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:23,967
<i>And now back to... </i>
<i>"La UÚltima Pasión."</i>

321
00:23:24,141 --> 00:23:25,839
I have fallen in love
with another.

322
00:23:27,971 --> 00:23:31,235
But who, Gabriella?
Tell me who!

323
00:23:33,063 --> 00:23:35,196
My twin brother, Pablo?

324
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,851
<i>Pablo!</i>

325
00:23:39,766 --> 00:23:41,158
!¡Bastardo!

326
00:23:41,332 --> 00:23:43,726
Buenos días, !¡hermano!

327
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,032
<i>No!</i>

328
00:23:47,513 --> 00:23:49,819
Let that be a lesson
to you, Juan.

329
00:23:49,993 --> 00:23:51,560
Family

330
00:23:51,734 --> 00:23:54,955
is a field
of emotional claymores

331
00:23:55,129 --> 00:23:57,348
that leave you abandoned,
betrayed

332
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:02,005
and weeping
while you eat cake,

333
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:04,573
which creates copious amounts
of adipose tissue,

334
00:24:04,747 --> 00:24:07,750
and what some calloused
individuals refer to as...

335
00:24:07,924 --> 00:24:10,536
...man boobs.

336
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:11,885
Ha.

337
00:24:29,685 --> 00:24:31,731
Doctor,
we have visitors.

338
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,212
Really?

339
00:24:35,386 --> 00:24:38,085
I thought I was having
an anthropomorphic nightmare.

340
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:39,739
Where the only person
I could trust in the world

341
00:24:39,913 --> 00:24:41,436
showed up with
all my worst enemies,

342
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:43,307
while I was in a bathrobe,

343
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,745
playing congas
on my big, fat belly!

344
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,181
Sorry, sir.

345
00:24:47,355 --> 00:24:49,488
I don't believe it.
Eggman's alive?

346
00:24:49,662 --> 00:24:52,012
And he's never
looked worse.

347
00:24:52,186 --> 00:24:54,493
Well, maybe,

348
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:58,540
this is what not giving a damn
what you think I look like looks like.

349
00:24:58,714 --> 00:25:01,935
Sir, right now we have
an even bigger problem.

350
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:03,502
Oh, come on.

351
00:25:05,634 --> 00:25:07,941
There's an imposter out there
using your technology.

352
00:25:08,115 --> 00:25:11,422
Imposter.
That's impossi-- What?

353
00:25:11,597 --> 00:25:13,076
No.

354
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:17,298
My sweet mechanized spawn!

355
00:25:17,472 --> 00:25:21,084
Whomever this party-pooping
posse is looking for

356
00:25:21,258 --> 00:25:23,565
has stolen my persona

357
00:25:23,739 --> 00:25:27,090
and the precious babies
from my egg sac.

358
00:25:27,787 --> 00:25:29,266
Well...

359
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,836
I'll soon egg-xact
my revenge.

360
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:35,664
You see what I did there?

361
00:25:35,838 --> 00:25:39,059
It's time for the dramatic
soap-opera twist,

362
00:25:39,233 --> 00:25:43,367
where this Pablo
reveals his Juan!

363
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:47,415
By cross-referencing
the precise coordinates

364
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:50,331
of each drone's
energy spikes,

365
00:25:51,071 --> 00:25:53,203
I can track my babies

366
00:25:53,377 --> 00:25:55,989
to the imposter's
base of operations,

367
00:25:56,163 --> 00:25:57,556
right about...

368
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:58,557
there!

369
00:25:58,731 --> 00:26:00,471
Sonic, I hate to say it,

370
00:26:00,646 --> 00:26:02,822
but I think we're both
after the same person.

371
00:26:02,996 --> 00:26:05,433
Hold on, hold on.
You're not suggesting we team up

372
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:07,914
with Doctor Ro-Butt-Stink,
are you?

373
00:26:08,088 --> 00:26:09,524
Perhaps the fox is right.

374
00:26:09,698 --> 00:26:12,571
It could be our only chance
to find this mysterious,

375
00:26:12,745 --> 00:26:14,137
more impressive hedgehog.

376
00:26:15,661 --> 00:26:17,706
All right, Egghead.
I hate to say it,

377
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,447
but it looks like
we're partners.

378
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,493
On one condition.

379
00:26:23,973 --> 00:26:26,541
Dude, you have serious issues.

380
00:26:26,715 --> 00:26:27,803
Ow!

381
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:32,808
Let's...

382
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:34,723
do this!

383
00:27:01,097 --> 00:27:02,316
Suck it in!

384
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,189
Tinker-tailor?

385
00:27:06,363 --> 00:27:07,800
I need room.

386
00:27:07,974 --> 00:27:10,629
Think Elvis, circa 1976.

387
00:27:10,803 --> 00:27:13,066
But sir, I don't have
the proper materials.

388
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,459
Found some.

389
00:27:17,984 --> 00:27:19,159
Resourceful.

390
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,767
Hey! This is a restricted area.

391
00:28:01,941 --> 00:28:04,204
Oh, it's okay.
She's the professor's granddaughter.

392
00:28:04,378 --> 00:28:06,510
He takes her everywhere.

393
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,775
Welcome to the lab, Maria.
I'm Captain Walters.

394
00:28:09,949 --> 00:28:11,341
Oh, do you know
where my room is?

395
00:28:11,515 --> 00:28:13,082
Yeah, down the hall
and to the right.

396
00:28:13,256 --> 00:28:14,780
Make yourself at home.

397
00:28:14,954 --> 00:28:16,129
But, um,

398
00:28:16,303 --> 00:28:18,087
let's lose the skates,
okay, kiddo?

399
00:28:18,261 --> 00:28:19,698
Okay.

400
00:30:39,925 --> 00:30:41,100
Look out!

401
00:31:25,013 --> 00:31:26,188
Wow.

402
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,321
Look at all those stars.

403
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:31,977
They're like diamonds.

404
00:31:33,674 --> 00:31:35,415
My grandfather says

405
00:31:35,589 --> 00:31:37,243
it can take hundreds of years

406
00:31:37,417 --> 00:31:39,419
for the light of a star
to reach Earth.

407
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,030
And by the time you see it,

408
00:31:42,204 --> 00:31:44,511
the star might not even
exist anymore.

409
00:31:46,034 --> 00:31:47,514
Isn't that crazy?

410
00:31:48,994 --> 00:31:50,865
A light shines,

411
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,998
even though the star is gone.

412
00:31:54,564 --> 00:31:56,392
Yeah, it does.

413
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,918
I wonder which one
you came from, Shadow.

414
00:32:00,092 --> 00:32:00,962
I don't know.

415
00:32:02,094 --> 00:32:04,574
I don't know anything
about my home.

416
00:32:04,748 --> 00:32:07,142
This is your home, Shadow.

417
00:32:07,882 --> 00:32:09,014
Earth.

418
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,239
Maria,

419
00:32:17,892 --> 00:32:19,589
do you think I'm...

420
00:32:20,547 --> 00:32:21,809
dangerous?

421
00:32:23,071 --> 00:32:24,899
What are you talking about?

422
00:32:25,073 --> 00:32:27,641
The way the scientists
look at me,

423
00:32:27,815 --> 00:32:29,512
I can tell they're afraid.

424
00:32:29,686 --> 00:32:33,255
Like I'm the horrible thing
from that movie we watched.

425
00:32:34,343 --> 00:32:35,779
I don't know...

426
00:32:36,476 --> 00:32:37,956
what I am.

427
00:32:43,222 --> 00:32:44,788
You're my friend.

428
00:32:46,138 --> 00:32:48,792
And you can do or be
anything you want.

429
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,578
Not because of your powers,

430
00:32:51,752 --> 00:32:55,190
but because of who you are...
in here.

431
00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:00,195
I don't know what I'd do
without you.

432
00:33:42,107 --> 00:33:43,804
Professor?

433
00:33:43,978 --> 00:33:47,025
It's good to see you,
Shadow.

434
00:33:47,199 --> 00:33:49,288
I knew you'd come home.

435
00:33:49,462 --> 00:33:52,030
I can't get her out of my head.

436
00:33:52,204 --> 00:33:53,727
The pain...

437
00:33:53,901 --> 00:33:55,250
It's too much.

438
00:33:55,424 --> 00:33:58,906
And that is why
we have to punish them.

439
00:34:03,432 --> 00:34:05,043
Okay, I don't like you
and you don't like me.

440
00:34:05,217 --> 00:34:07,045
Let's get this
over with quickly.

441
00:34:07,219 --> 00:34:09,047
Out of my way, dorkupine.

442
00:34:09,221 --> 00:34:11,310
"Dorkupine"?
Really clever.

443
00:34:17,794 --> 00:34:19,883
This door is six-inch-thick
solid steel

444
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,842
on a pressurized latch.

445
00:34:22,016 --> 00:34:24,192
I'll need a moment to calculate
the molecular density

446
00:34:24,366 --> 00:34:25,976
and invert
the venting mechanics.

447
00:34:29,632 --> 00:34:30,894
I unlocked it.

448
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:34,072
Subtle as always,
fist-for-brains.

449
00:34:35,334 --> 00:34:37,075
Easy, Shadow.

450
00:34:37,249 --> 00:34:39,729
Those are the guests
I've been expecting.

451
00:34:39,903 --> 00:34:42,558
Let's give them
a warm welcome.

452
00:34:46,388 --> 00:34:47,737
Whoa.

453
00:34:47,911 --> 00:34:49,174
What is this place?

454
00:34:49,348 --> 00:34:51,306
It looks like
a military base,

455
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,308
but nobody's been here
for years.

456
00:34:53,482 --> 00:34:54,875
I wonder if it's haunted.

457
00:34:55,049 --> 00:34:57,965
Haunted? Nobody said anything
about being haunted.

458
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:01,099
What's the matter?
You afraid of g-g-g-ghosts?

459
00:35:01,273 --> 00:35:03,362
Nothing scares
an Echidna warrior.

460
00:35:03,536 --> 00:35:05,929
Uh, yeah. Do you remember
what happened last movie night?

461
00:35:09,324 --> 00:35:10,760
Let go, let go, let go!

462
00:35:10,934 --> 00:35:13,633
There is no such thing
as a friendly ghost.

463
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,723
So which way do we go?

464
00:35:16,897 --> 00:35:20,596
I know! We should split up.

465
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:23,991
Everyone with hideous,
brightly-colored fur take the left and the middle.

466
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:25,775
Stone and I will go right.

467
00:35:25,949 --> 00:35:27,690
No, no, no, no, no. I'm not
letting you out of my sight.

468
00:35:27,864 --> 00:35:29,649
Tails, you and Stone go left.

469
00:35:29,823 --> 00:35:32,913
Knuckles, you take the middle.
Eggman, you and me go right.

470
00:35:33,087 --> 00:35:35,002
By all means.

471
00:35:35,176 --> 00:35:36,656
We could use some
time together.

472
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,440
To work on
your trust issues.

473
00:35:38,614 --> 00:35:41,443
You know what? You're right.
I should be more trusting.

474
00:35:41,617 --> 00:35:44,403
I mean, you've only tried
to kill me twice!

475
00:35:46,448 --> 00:35:48,668
Just a dark, creepy hallway.

476
00:35:48,842 --> 00:35:50,539
Nothing to be afraid of.

477
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,977
You hear that, ghost?

478
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,675
You don't frighten me!

479
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,551
Get... a... grip.

480
00:36:03,465 --> 00:36:05,206
Boo.

481
00:36:07,904 --> 00:36:10,603
I'm just gonna
come right out and say this:

482
00:36:10,777 --> 00:36:13,562
You're adorable.
Oh, um, thanks.

483
00:36:13,736 --> 00:36:17,175
So, what's it like
being Sonic's assistant?

484
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:20,656
You have a daily routine?
Paid time off? Benefits?

485
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:24,007
Oh, I'm not Sonic's assistant.
We're teammates.

486
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,184
He's the leader,
Knuckles is the muscle,

487
00:36:26,358 --> 00:36:27,924
and I'm the gadget guy.

488
00:36:28,098 --> 00:36:29,448
We all have a role to play.

489
00:36:29,622 --> 00:36:31,363
That's what makes the team
so special!

490
00:36:31,537 --> 00:36:33,278
That and the fact
we're best friends.

491
00:36:34,017 --> 00:36:35,323
You are?

492
00:36:35,497 --> 00:36:37,325
Well, yeah.
Just like you and Eggman, right?

493
00:36:39,153 --> 00:36:41,199
Uh... Yeah, eh...

494
00:36:41,373 --> 00:36:43,375
Of course! Yes.

495
00:36:43,549 --> 00:36:46,421
Me and the doctor,
best of friends.

496
00:36:47,901 --> 00:36:49,468
That's definitely
what we are.

497
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:55,735
Hmm.

498
00:37:14,841 --> 00:37:18,410
Whoa. Look at all this stuff.

499
00:37:18,584 --> 00:37:21,717
This was more than
just a military base or a lab.

500
00:37:22,283 --> 00:37:23,719
It was a home.

501
00:37:23,893 --> 00:37:25,460
People lived here.

502
00:37:26,069 --> 00:37:27,549
He had a family.

503
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:30,117
Is that what I smell?

504
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:33,381
The stench
of domestic harmony?

505
00:37:33,555 --> 00:37:37,080
You ever wonder what
your life would have been like if you had a family?

506
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,691
Hmm... No!

507
00:37:38,865 --> 00:37:40,867
Maybe you wouldn't have gone
full supervillain.

508
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:43,870
I have no parents,
no aunts, no uncles.

509
00:37:44,044 --> 00:37:46,568
And something about my attitude
renders me...

510
00:37:47,526 --> 00:37:51,660
undesirable
to all possible genders.

511
00:37:53,532 --> 00:37:55,708
My future is a cul-de-sac!

512
00:37:56,709 --> 00:37:58,711
The Robotnik name ends...

513
00:38:00,365 --> 00:38:02,018
<i>avec moi.</i>

514
00:38:02,192 --> 00:38:04,238
Yes, I know French.

515
00:38:08,764 --> 00:38:09,852
Whoa.

516
00:38:10,026 --> 00:38:13,029
Is this where you grew up,
Shadow?

517
00:38:13,203 --> 00:38:14,988
No wonder you're so mad.

518
00:38:15,162 --> 00:38:18,034
This place could really use
a beanbag chair

519
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:19,514
and some comic books.

520
00:38:21,037 --> 00:38:22,256
What happened here?

521
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,434
I'm tired
of giving you warnings!

522
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,700
Where'd you go, hedgehog?

523
00:38:31,874 --> 00:38:33,746
I wasn't finished
trauma dumping.

524
00:38:35,574 --> 00:38:38,359
My darlings!

525
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:42,668
My eggy weggies!

It couldn't be.Couldn't it?

537
00:39:19,922 --> 00:39:20,706
I'm--Are you?

538
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,055
Imposter!

539
00:39:22,229 --> 00:39:24,492
You stole my babies!

540
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:27,843
But they know
who their real daddy is...

541
00:39:28,017 --> 00:39:29,105
drone-napper!

542
00:39:30,977 --> 00:39:34,067
Magnificent creations,
my boy.

543
00:39:34,241 --> 00:39:36,809
I borrowed them
to lure you here

544
00:39:36,983 --> 00:39:38,985
and reunite our family.

545
00:39:40,726 --> 00:39:42,380
You see, Ivo...

546
00:39:44,512 --> 00:39:47,515
I'm your grandfather:

547
00:39:47,689 --> 00:39:50,126
Gerald Robotnik.

548
00:39:54,174 --> 00:39:56,872
My... grandfather?

549
00:39:58,613 --> 00:40:01,486
But how? And why?

550
00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:04,314
And who did what with whom?

551
00:40:04,489 --> 00:40:09,407
You hail from an ancestry
of excellence...

552
00:40:09,581 --> 00:40:12,148
tied directly <i>à moi.</i>

553
00:40:12,322 --> 00:40:15,238
Yes, I know French.

554
00:40:17,763 --> 00:40:19,286
You do look like me.

555
00:40:20,243 --> 00:40:22,202
But fatter. And older.

556
00:40:23,072 --> 00:40:25,031
And there's that funny smell.

557
00:40:26,728 --> 00:40:29,557
But the resemblance
is uncanny.

558
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,038
It's as if...

559
00:40:32,212 --> 00:40:34,301
...we're two characters in a movie

560
00:40:34,475 --> 00:40:37,043
being played
by the same actor.

561
00:40:37,217 --> 00:40:39,654
But I need real proof!Ivo!

562
00:40:39,828 --> 00:40:41,134
We have very little time.

563
00:40:42,657 --> 00:40:44,790
But I could field
a couple of queries.

564
00:40:44,964 --> 00:40:48,097
Name the most elegant formula
in mathematics.

565
00:40:48,271 --> 00:40:49,621
Euler's Identity.

566
00:40:49,795 --> 00:40:52,101
E to the I times pi plus one
equals zilch.

567
00:40:52,275 --> 00:40:54,103
European capitals
arranged alphabetically

568
00:40:54,277 --> 00:40:55,540
by the fourth letter.

569
00:40:55,714 --> 00:40:57,455
Riga, Monaco, Sarajevo, Tirana.

570
00:40:57,629 --> 00:40:59,413
The speed of light
divided by the speed of sound,

571
00:40:59,587 --> 00:41:01,633
divided by
the speed of the bus in the movie <i>Speed.</i>

572
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:05,898
17,893.33333...

573
00:41:06,072 --> 00:41:09,510
Rounding up?17,894 MPH.

574
00:41:09,684 --> 00:41:12,165
And, for all the marbles...

575
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:14,515
Good. I lost mine.

576
00:41:14,689 --> 00:41:16,735
A rare lung disease,

577
00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:19,999
and the longest word
in the English dictionary.

578
00:41:20,652 --> 00:41:22,131
Um...

579
00:41:22,305 --> 00:41:25,613
Pneumonoultramicroscopic-
silicovolcanoconiosis!

580
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:30,139
Pap-pap!In the saggy flesh.

581
00:41:30,313 --> 00:41:32,402
But looking pretty good
for a hundred and ten.

582
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,451
Oh, Grampy-poo!

583
00:41:40,846 --> 00:41:44,632
Where have you been
my entire life?

584
00:41:46,547 --> 00:41:48,549
Wait.

585
00:41:48,723 --> 00:41:50,943
Where have you been...
my entire life?

586
00:41:51,117 --> 00:41:57,123
Locked in
a top-secret prison for the last 50 years.

587
00:41:57,297 --> 00:42:00,561
Made it kind of hard
to send Christmas cards.

588
00:42:00,735 --> 00:42:02,215
Now...

589
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:05,958
you're probably wondering
why I brought you here.

590
00:42:06,132 --> 00:42:07,525
You didn't bring me here!

591
00:42:07,699 --> 00:42:11,006
I used my unparalleled intellect
to track you down.

592
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:15,097
Per the plan
I concocted with my unparalleled intellect.

593
00:42:15,271 --> 00:42:17,056
You'll see.

594
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:19,798
I have the answer
to everything.

595
00:42:21,408 --> 00:42:23,062
Come on, kiddo.

596
00:42:36,858 --> 00:42:38,817
Oh, no. Oh, no, no.

597
00:42:38,991 --> 00:42:40,819
Someone tell me
this is some kind of

598
00:42:40,993 --> 00:42:43,125
concussion-induced nightmare.

599
00:42:43,299 --> 00:42:45,432
There's two Eggmen now?

600
00:42:45,606 --> 00:42:47,608
Double your villains,
double your fun!

601
00:42:47,782 --> 00:42:50,568
Two Robotniks
are way worse than one.

602
00:42:50,742 --> 00:42:51,743
Chest bump?

603
00:42:51,917 --> 00:42:52,744
No.

604
00:42:53,832 --> 00:42:55,921
Stone,
why are you tied up?

605
00:42:56,095 --> 00:42:58,663
Do that on your own time.
You sicken me.

606
00:42:58,837 --> 00:43:01,230
You must be
the long-lost grandson.

607
00:43:01,404 --> 00:43:04,277
And you must be
another stinking hedgehog.

608
00:43:04,451 --> 00:43:06,496
So you're the one
behind all this.

609
00:43:06,671 --> 00:43:08,890
The Shadow breakout.The attack on Walters.

610
00:43:09,064 --> 00:43:10,239
That musty
old-man smell.

611
00:43:10,413 --> 00:43:12,372
How dare you insult me

612
00:43:12,546 --> 00:43:14,200
with your unsolicited
exposition!

613
00:43:14,374 --> 00:43:16,463
Shadow, get the key.

614
00:43:16,637 --> 00:43:17,638
Where is it?

615
00:43:17,812 --> 00:43:19,901
Ha! Good one, Hot Topic.

616
00:43:20,075 --> 00:43:22,164
Do you really think
we'd be that stupid

617
00:43:22,338 --> 00:43:24,384
to bring the key
right to you?

618
00:43:24,558 --> 00:43:25,994
Yep, we're that stupid.

619
00:43:26,168 --> 00:43:28,344
GUN took everything from us.

620
00:43:28,518 --> 00:43:31,434
And now we are going
to take everything from them.

621
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:32,871
With this.

622
00:43:33,045 --> 00:43:36,701
My masterpiece
of malevolence...

623
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:39,399
The Eclipse Cannon.

624
00:43:39,573 --> 00:43:42,663
<i>In exchange</i>
<i>for my freedom,</i>

625
00:43:42,837 --> 00:43:44,970
<i>I gave GUN</i>
<i>the most powerful weapon</i>

626
00:43:45,144 --> 00:43:47,668
<i>mankind has ever seen,</i>

627
00:43:47,842 --> 00:43:50,410
<i>capable of delivering</i>
<i>a precision strike</i>

628
00:43:50,584 --> 00:43:51,977
<i>anywhere on Earth.</i>

629
00:43:53,413 --> 00:43:54,632
<i>Our first target:</i>

630
00:43:55,458 --> 00:43:57,112
<i>GUN Headquarters.</i>

631
00:43:57,286 --> 00:43:59,419
But firing a weapon
that powerful

632
00:43:59,593 --> 00:44:01,551
could threaten millions
of innocent lives!

633
00:44:01,726 --> 00:44:03,989
Yeah, tera-bite me.

634
00:44:04,163 --> 00:44:09,037
This is one of two keys required
to launch the Eclipse Cannon.

635
00:44:09,211 --> 00:44:11,518
The other is locked
inside GUN headquarters.

636
00:44:11,692 --> 00:44:13,563
Once we have both,

637
00:44:13,738 --> 00:44:16,566
I will take rightful control
of my weapon.

638
00:44:16,741 --> 00:44:18,525
I'm in.

639
00:44:25,488 --> 00:44:26,968
Holy crab!

640
00:44:27,142 --> 00:44:28,753
Spacious and crustaceous.

641
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:30,842
Thank you so much

642
00:44:31,016 --> 00:44:32,670
for inspiring
this little adventure.

643
00:44:32,844 --> 00:44:35,020
It really worked out
for me.

644
00:44:35,194 --> 00:44:38,153
And you wonder why
I have trust issues!

645
00:44:39,633 --> 00:44:41,809
Shadow, wait! Don't do this.

646
00:44:41,983 --> 00:44:43,376
I know you're hurting,

647
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:46,074
but don't let that change
who you are inside.

648
00:44:46,248 --> 00:44:50,513
I've spent 50 years
reliving what they did to her.

649
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:53,603
This is who I am inside.

650
00:44:59,609 --> 00:45:03,657
Uh, nice magic marble.
Real scary.

651
00:45:06,878 --> 00:45:08,880
That actually
is real scary!

652
00:45:10,969 --> 00:45:12,448
It's a mini black hole!

653
00:45:12,622 --> 00:45:14,973
It's going to suck in
all the matter in this base!

654
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:22,154
Fear not, friends.

655
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:24,722
Even my teeth are muscles!

656
00:45:30,292 --> 00:45:32,773
Sonic, try to reach
one of my rings!

657
00:45:32,947 --> 00:45:34,166
Got one.

658
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,559
Check this out. Trick shot!

659
00:45:40,259 --> 00:45:41,739
Come on.

660
00:45:43,001 --> 00:45:44,567
Come on.

661
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,395
Come on.

662
00:45:48,006 --> 00:45:49,703
Come on!

663
00:45:59,104 --> 00:46:01,628
Yeah! Yes!

664
00:46:05,327 --> 00:46:06,328
Yikes.

665
00:46:07,634 --> 00:46:09,418
Somebody better call
Google Maps.

666
00:46:13,335 --> 00:46:17,470
I've spent years
trying to cleanse the cosmos

667
00:46:17,644 --> 00:46:21,300
of that spiny,
blue speed freak.

668
00:46:21,474 --> 00:46:23,128
And you did it...

669
00:46:24,651 --> 00:46:26,479
in one afternoon.

670
00:46:26,653 --> 00:46:30,570
There's nothing
we can't destroy together, my boy.

671
00:46:30,744 --> 00:46:33,616
Charting route to GUN
Headquarters in London, sirs.

672
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,880
ETA four hours.

673
00:46:36,054 --> 00:46:37,359
As the crab flies.

674
00:46:37,533 --> 00:46:39,884
By all accounts,
we're ahead of schedule.

675
00:46:40,841 --> 00:46:42,756
We should take this time

676
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:44,932
to get to know
each other better.

677
00:46:45,106 --> 00:46:46,847
Wow. What?

678
00:46:47,587 --> 00:46:48,675
You mean...

679
00:46:48,849 --> 00:46:52,113
spend some
qua-qua-quality time?

680
00:46:52,287 --> 00:46:57,031
You've waited for this
your whole life.

681
00:46:57,205 --> 00:47:03,516
How would you choose
to spend one perfect day with your new grand pal?

682
00:47:57,396 --> 00:48:00,703
Ooh!

683
00:48:39,525 --> 00:48:40,961
And done!

684
00:48:41,135 --> 00:48:43,877
Masterpiece.
Look at that.Yay!

685
00:48:44,051 --> 00:48:47,489
It's really been great
having time to ourselves.

686
00:48:47,663 --> 00:48:50,101
Right. Absolutely.
I just feel so...

687
00:48:50,275 --> 00:48:51,667
relaxed, you know?
Clearheaded.

688
00:48:51,841 --> 00:48:54,148
Mmm, look at all these
new interests we found.

689
00:48:54,322 --> 00:48:56,324
I know, so many hobbies.So many!

690
00:48:56,498 --> 00:48:59,327
After the action and adventure
of the last few years,

691
00:48:59,501 --> 00:49:01,721
well, I could get used to this.Same.

692
00:49:07,466 --> 00:49:09,816
Tom! Maddie!
We need your help on a super--

693
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:12,819
Knuckles, do you mind?Oh! Excuse me.

694
00:49:12,993 --> 00:49:14,429
Tom! Maddie! We need your help

695
00:49:14,603 --> 00:49:16,127
on a super-dangerous
top-secret mission!

696
00:49:16,301 --> 00:49:17,345
Hmm.

697
00:49:19,086 --> 00:49:20,740
Thank God. Yeah, we're in.Let's go.

698
00:49:20,914 --> 00:49:23,134
Really? You're in?
Just like that?

699
00:49:23,308 --> 00:49:26,050
Yes. It was getting so boring
without you guys here.Yeah. So...

700
00:49:26,224 --> 00:49:27,877
No offense....boring. No, none taken.

701
00:49:28,052 --> 00:49:29,531
I mean, whatever crazy plan
you're cooking up,

702
00:49:29,705 --> 00:49:31,011
the answer's yes.Yes.

703
00:49:31,185 --> 00:49:34,145
Great. But first things first:
What is that?

704
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:35,798
Oh! This is...

705
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,409
...Li'l Tom!

706
00:49:37,583 --> 00:49:39,063
Isn't he great?

707
00:49:40,629 --> 00:49:42,849
I told you
to get rid of that. It's very creepy.

708
00:49:43,023 --> 00:49:44,198
I told him to get rid of you.

709
00:49:44,372 --> 00:49:45,765
Okay, that's, mmm...

710
00:49:45,939 --> 00:49:48,159
crossing a line there.You are in so much trouble.

711
00:49:50,248 --> 00:49:52,990
Okay, this is it.
The belly of the beast.

712
00:49:53,164 --> 00:49:55,427
GUN Headquarters in London.

713
00:49:55,601 --> 00:49:58,560
Tom, we're finally gonna
get to see London together.

714
00:49:58,734 --> 00:50:00,693
Hey, I told you we'd
get there someday, baby.

715
00:50:00,867 --> 00:50:02,564
Okay. So here's the plan.

716
00:50:02,738 --> 00:50:04,784
<i>I run in superfast,</i>

717
00:50:04,958 --> 00:50:06,916
<i>fly over that water,</i>
<i>no problem,</i>

718
00:50:07,091 --> 00:50:08,396
<i>and right when I get to the--</i>

719
00:50:09,789 --> 00:50:11,443
What just happened?

720
00:50:11,617 --> 00:50:12,966
Congratulations.

721
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:15,142
You just got incinerated
by their energy shield.

722
00:50:15,316 --> 00:50:18,928
We'll need to shut it down
by planting a USB drive in their server room

723
00:50:19,103 --> 00:50:21,322
<i>that will give me full control </i>
<i>over it.</i>

724
00:50:21,496 --> 00:50:23,107
That's what we need you two for.

725
00:50:23,281 --> 00:50:24,978
Couple of badass spies,
that's what we are.

726
00:50:25,152 --> 00:50:26,675
Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

727
00:50:26,849 --> 00:50:28,503
<i>Once we</i>
<i>disable the shield,</i>

728
00:50:28,677 --> 00:50:30,505
<i>you'll face the laser hall.</i>

729
00:50:32,464 --> 00:50:35,728
<i>These high-density bad boys </i>
<i>will cut you into tiny pieces.</i>

730
00:50:37,208 --> 00:50:39,732
<i>And cut those pieces</i>
<i>into even tinier pieces!</i>

731
00:50:39,906 --> 00:50:41,995
Once again...

732
00:50:42,169 --> 00:50:44,389
Can't we just get Tom Cruise
to do this?Nope.

733
00:50:44,563 --> 00:50:48,175
<i>Because not even he </i>
<i>could break into... the vault.</i>

734
00:50:48,349 --> 00:50:49,785
<i>Why is it empty in there?</i>

735
00:50:49,959 --> 00:50:51,396
<i>Because we have no idea</i>

736
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:53,050
<i>what's on the other side</i>
<i>of that door.</i>

737
00:50:53,224 --> 00:50:55,704
<i>To prevent the vault from ever </i>
<i>being accessed by a ring,</i>

738
00:50:55,878 --> 00:50:58,838
<i>all images and schematics have </i>
<i>been wiped from GUN's database.</i>

739
00:50:59,012 --> 00:51:01,058
So for the last leg
of this heist...

740
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,278
...we're going in blind.

741
00:51:08,978 --> 00:51:10,197
Sorry.

742
00:51:10,371 --> 00:51:11,894
Okay,
I'm just gonna say it.

743
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,462
It sounds like this plan would
work a heck of a lot better

744
00:51:14,636 --> 00:51:18,162
if Sonic used the Master Emerald
to go Golden God mode

745
00:51:18,336 --> 00:51:19,554
to get the key.

746
00:51:20,642 --> 00:51:22,166
No way, Maddie.

747
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:24,298
The Master Emerald
is too powerful to ever use again.

748
00:51:24,472 --> 00:51:26,779
We made a promise to each other
to keep it hidden.

749
00:51:26,953 --> 00:51:29,086
In a location
only Knuckles knows.

750
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:31,436
As guardian
of the Master Emerald,

751
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:34,482
anyone who tries
to take it away for any reason...

752
00:51:34,656 --> 00:51:36,963
will become a sworn enemy.

753
00:51:37,137 --> 00:51:38,878
Okay, okay! Sheesh!

754
00:51:39,052 --> 00:51:40,662
No need to get
all growly on me, buddy.

755
00:51:40,836 --> 00:51:43,970
You guys are always telling us
to make good choices.

756
00:51:44,144 --> 00:51:45,885
Well, this is the right choice.

757
00:51:46,059 --> 00:51:47,626
Okay.

758
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,107
I guess
we're going to...

759
00:52:05,687 --> 00:52:07,515
London, baby!

760
00:52:10,779 --> 00:52:13,304
GUN Headquarters
is right there.

761
00:52:13,478 --> 00:52:17,438
Let me go in, get the key
and destroy anyone in my way!

762
00:52:17,612 --> 00:52:19,179
I want revenge.

763
00:52:19,353 --> 00:52:20,702
Patience, Shadow.

764
00:52:20,876 --> 00:52:23,140
Just let us handle this...

765
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:27,448
and I promise
you'll have revenge

766
00:52:27,622 --> 00:52:31,365
on a scale you couldn't
possibly imagine.

767
00:52:31,539 --> 00:52:34,542
Come on, Granddaddy-O,
we've got...

768
00:52:34,716 --> 00:52:35,761
dirt to do!

769
00:52:35,935 --> 00:52:37,719
Suits.

770
00:52:37,893 --> 00:52:38,894
Right here, sir.

771
00:52:39,939 --> 00:52:41,810
Stone, babysit the hedgehog.

772
00:52:41,984 --> 00:52:44,422
Keep the crab on a low boil.

773
00:52:45,597 --> 00:52:47,903
It's time
for more family bonding.

774
00:52:52,691 --> 00:52:54,171
Come on, Shadow.

775
00:52:54,345 --> 00:52:58,262
Got fresh avocados in the crab.
We'll make guac.

776
00:53:00,002 --> 00:53:01,830
Revenge guac!

777
00:53:09,751 --> 00:53:13,799
Guys, are you ready for me yet?
I've been waiting here all day.

778
00:53:16,584 --> 00:53:19,413
Sonic,
we literally just started.

779
00:53:19,587 --> 00:53:21,807
Tom, Maddie,
are you in position and ready?

780
00:53:21,981 --> 00:53:24,113
We were born ready.Let's do this.

781
00:53:24,288 --> 00:53:25,506
<i>Knuckles, how about you?</i>

782
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,813
I have taken my perch
atop the giant clock.

783
00:53:27,987 --> 00:53:30,642
Now, where is this glass
I'm supposed to break?

784
00:53:30,816 --> 00:53:32,296
Actually, Knucks, your job

785
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:34,776
is to "Break Glass
in Case of Emergency."

786
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:36,474
Understood.

787
00:53:36,648 --> 00:53:39,868
I will shatter this glass
like the jaw of a vile foe.

788
00:53:40,042 --> 00:53:41,957
In case of emergency.

789
00:53:42,131 --> 00:53:44,830
<i>I will pulverize it like </i>
<i>the skull of a loathsome rival!</i>

790
00:53:45,004 --> 00:53:48,094
Just to be clear,
the "emergency" is the important part.

791
00:53:48,268 --> 00:53:49,922
The glass will beg for mercy

792
00:53:50,096 --> 00:53:52,403
under the shadow
of my mighty fist!

793
00:53:52,577 --> 00:53:54,013
Guys, remember,
we're a team.

794
00:53:54,187 --> 00:53:55,536
Let's focus.Please.

795
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:56,885
<i>You know what?</i>
<i>Let's move on.</i>

796
00:53:57,059 --> 00:53:58,887
All right,
everyone knows what to do.

797
00:53:59,061 --> 00:54:01,150
Tom and Maddie,
you guys plant the USB drive.

798
00:54:01,325 --> 00:54:03,849
I'll disable the traps.
Sonic will snag the launch key.

799
00:54:04,023 --> 00:54:05,764
And Knuckles, you stand by to--

800
00:54:05,938 --> 00:54:08,288
Break glass in case
of emergency.

801
00:54:08,462 --> 00:54:09,681
See? He gets it.

802
00:54:09,855 --> 00:54:11,204
Then we're all set.

803
00:54:11,378 --> 00:54:12,945
Hologram time.

804
00:54:14,512 --> 00:54:15,426
You go first.

805
00:54:17,558 --> 00:54:19,256
Tom, it's me, Rachel!

806
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:21,258
Can you believe it?
We're both in London together.

807
00:54:21,432 --> 00:54:23,216
Have you met your sister?
Try again.

808
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:24,435
Unless...

809
00:54:24,609 --> 00:54:26,393
you're not
up for this mission.

810
00:54:26,567 --> 00:54:28,787
Yeah, maybe you want
to be back in Green Hills, baking sourdough.

811
00:54:28,961 --> 00:54:30,615
Thomas Michael Wachowski!Gah!

812
00:54:30,789 --> 00:54:32,225
You brought aliens
to my wedding,

813
00:54:32,399 --> 00:54:34,227
punched out my husband
and buried me in an avalanche.

814
00:54:34,401 --> 00:54:36,316
Your day of reckoning
is at hand!

815
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:37,491
Yeah, that's perfect.

816
00:54:37,665 --> 00:54:40,102
Okay, now for
her better half.

817
00:54:41,887 --> 00:54:46,674
Ho-ho, my name is Randall,
and I am too much to handle!

818
00:54:46,848 --> 00:54:48,502
Welcome to the gun show!

819
00:54:48,676 --> 00:54:51,723
Baby, would you describe me
as jacked, juiced,

820
00:54:51,897 --> 00:54:54,116
or shredded?

821
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,944
I would describe your head
as swollen.

822
00:54:56,118 --> 00:54:57,294
Let's get to work.

823
00:55:00,949 --> 00:55:02,603
Agent Randall Handel.

824
00:55:02,777 --> 00:55:05,432
I'm here to have lunch
with my lovely wife, Rachel.

825
00:55:05,606 --> 00:55:06,912
I'm sorry, Agent Handel,

826
00:55:07,086 --> 00:55:09,349
this facility's
currently locked down.

827
00:55:09,523 --> 00:55:11,133
Command-level
clearance only.

828
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:13,310
One minute.

829
00:55:14,267 --> 00:55:16,530
Tails... we have a problem here.

830
00:55:16,704 --> 00:55:19,577
Wow, they must have
tightened security after Shadow's escape.

831
00:55:19,751 --> 00:55:21,230
I got this.

832
00:55:22,275 --> 00:55:23,798
You must be new here.

833
00:55:23,972 --> 00:55:26,627
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Rachel.

834
00:55:26,801 --> 00:55:28,194
Rachel Gonnagetyoufired.

835
00:55:29,413 --> 00:55:31,110
Do you know what GUN
stands for?

836
00:55:31,284 --> 00:55:33,678
Well, 'course. Guardian Units--

837
00:55:33,852 --> 00:55:36,420
Getting. Ultra. Nasty.

838
00:55:36,594 --> 00:55:39,074
Do you want me...

839
00:55:39,248 --> 00:55:41,163
to get ultra nasty?

840
00:55:42,077 --> 00:55:43,296
Nasty nasty?

841
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:45,037
No, ma'am.Okay, then.

842
00:55:45,211 --> 00:55:46,865
Then go ahead and take
those little sad fingers

843
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:48,475
and start tippity
type-type-typing!

844
00:55:48,649 --> 00:55:51,435
Mm-hmm.
That's right, go on.

845
00:55:52,653 --> 00:55:54,046
Sorry for the inconvenience,
ma'am.

846
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:55,395
Mm-hmm.

847
00:55:56,178 --> 00:55:58,093
That's what I thought!

848
00:56:01,314 --> 00:56:03,751
My God,
I love being Rachel!

849
00:56:13,979 --> 00:56:16,155
Did it work?Oh, yeah.

850
00:56:16,808 --> 00:56:18,505
Oh! Ouch!

851
00:56:19,724 --> 00:56:22,161
Director Rockwell seeking
access to the server room.

852
00:56:22,335 --> 00:56:23,554
<i>Just one moment, ma'am.</i>

853
00:56:24,859 --> 00:56:27,732
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.
It's her. It's the real her!

854
00:56:27,906 --> 00:56:29,560
The incident in Colorado?We're still assessing.

855
00:56:29,734 --> 00:56:30,952
What do you mean,
we're still assessing?

856
00:56:31,126 --> 00:56:32,998
What do we do?Quick, change faces!

857
00:56:33,172 --> 00:56:34,303
Okay. Did it work?

858
00:56:34,478 --> 00:56:36,480
Who am I? What's going on?

859
00:56:36,654 --> 00:56:39,047
Why are you looking
at me like that? What am I doing wrong?

860
00:56:39,657 --> 00:56:40,962
Ow!

861
00:56:41,615 --> 00:56:42,747
Aye-aye, Captain!

862
00:56:46,054 --> 00:56:49,231
"Aye-aye, Captain"?
Who are you, Popeye?

863
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:51,146
I panicked! I was panicking!Jeez!

864
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:52,496
Get it together!

865
00:56:56,369 --> 00:56:57,805
Okay, Tails,
what are we looking for?

866
00:56:57,979 --> 00:57:01,330
<i>The security server is </i>
<i>in the 7th row, 23rd cabinet.</i>

867
00:57:01,505 --> 00:57:06,074
Are you guys finished yet?
This is taking forever.

868
00:57:06,248 --> 00:57:08,381
Uh-oh.

869
00:57:08,555 --> 00:57:10,601
Has the time come
to break the glass?

870
00:57:10,775 --> 00:57:12,646
Or at least break something?

871
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:14,605
All right, hang tight, guys.
Maddie's about to insert the drive.

872
00:57:15,388 --> 00:57:16,389
Ready?

873
00:57:16,563 --> 00:57:17,738
<i>Three...</i>

874
00:57:17,912 --> 00:57:19,044
<i>two...</i>

875
00:57:19,218 --> 00:57:20,480
<i>one...</i>

876
00:57:22,047 --> 00:57:23,309
Go.

877
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:27,531
It didn't work.

878
00:57:27,705 --> 00:57:28,880
Did you put it in
the right way?

879
00:57:29,054 --> 00:57:31,535
Try punching it.Do not try punching it.

880
00:57:31,709 --> 00:57:32,797
Oh!

881
00:57:32,971 --> 00:57:34,755
Take it out
and blow on it.Yes!

882
00:57:34,929 --> 00:57:36,801
Oh, come on, Tom.

883
00:57:36,975 --> 00:57:39,368
<i>There's absolutely</i>
<i>no scientific evidence</i> <i>to support--</i>

884
00:57:42,415 --> 00:57:43,808
Never mind. It worked!

885
00:57:43,982 --> 00:57:45,113
Little trick
from the '90s.

886
00:57:45,287 --> 00:57:47,681
I mean, best decade ever.
Right?

887
00:57:47,855 --> 00:57:49,640
I'm shutting down
the outside sensors now.

888
00:57:49,814 --> 00:57:51,163
Yes! Uh...

889
00:57:51,337 --> 00:57:53,644
Hold on. Is...

890
00:57:53,818 --> 00:57:55,428
there supposed to be
another USB drive here?

891
00:57:55,602 --> 00:57:58,126
One with a giant
mustache on it?

892
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:01,565
Oh, no.
I've got two heat signatures en route to the vault.

893
00:58:01,739 --> 00:58:03,088
Which can only mean...

894
00:58:09,529 --> 00:58:12,706
The Robotniks
have entered the chat.

895
00:58:13,707 --> 00:58:14,882
Wait.

896
00:58:15,056 --> 00:58:16,231
Poppyseed?

897
00:58:17,885 --> 00:58:19,365
Grand-geezer?

898
00:58:19,539 --> 00:58:20,975
<i>¿Dónde está?</i>

899
00:58:21,149 --> 00:58:22,890
I'm right here.

900
00:58:23,064 --> 00:58:24,631
If you weren't family,

901
00:58:24,805 --> 00:58:26,633
I could have gut you
like a pheasant.

902
00:58:26,807 --> 00:58:29,810
I mean, try to keep up.

903
00:58:33,248 --> 00:58:36,600
<i>And now back to </i>
<i>"La UÚltima Pasión."</i>

904
00:58:36,774 --> 00:58:38,166
<i>UÚltima Pasión...</i>

905
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:41,169
can only belong to one.

906
00:58:41,343 --> 00:58:42,388
No.

907
00:58:43,389 --> 00:58:46,827
It can only belong...
to Juan!

908
00:58:47,001 --> 00:58:49,395
Gabriella should kill them both.

909
00:58:49,569 --> 00:58:52,050
She's not a prize to be won.

910
00:58:52,224 --> 00:58:54,313
"Kill this. Murder that."

911
00:58:54,487 --> 00:58:57,882
You need to lighten up, Shadow.
We're about to rule the world.

912
00:58:58,056 --> 00:59:00,188
When we're done...

913
00:59:00,362 --> 00:59:03,104
there won't be
anything left to rule.

914
00:59:03,278 --> 00:59:05,890
That is dark. Even for you.

915
00:59:06,847 --> 00:59:08,414
What are you
and the professor up to?

916
00:59:08,588 --> 00:59:10,459
Hello! What's this?

917
00:59:10,634 --> 00:59:13,201
I knew I saw
an outside signal!

918
00:59:13,375 --> 00:59:15,247
<i>Cheerio!</i>

919
00:59:15,421 --> 00:59:17,379
<i>I guess someone </i>
<i>forgot to flush.</i>

920
00:59:38,357 --> 00:59:41,229
What now, my cunning cohort?

921
00:59:41,403 --> 00:59:42,927
Just a little teamwork!

922
00:59:50,848 --> 00:59:52,023
Hey...

923
00:59:52,676 --> 00:59:54,068
The lasers...

924
00:59:55,156 --> 00:59:57,768
don't seem to be
penetrating my suit.

925
00:59:59,117 --> 01:00:02,163
They're conforming
to the shape of my bodacious bod.

926
01:00:02,337 --> 01:00:03,774
Of course.

927
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:07,604
I designed these suits
to create a field

928
01:00:07,778 --> 01:00:09,867
of laser-bending
thermal distortion.

929
01:00:10,041 --> 01:00:11,956
Wasn't sure it would work
till now.

930
01:00:12,130 --> 01:00:13,566
You're heartless, son.

931
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:15,612
Hmm!Rotten to the core.

932
01:00:15,786 --> 01:00:17,483
Mm-hmm.I'm...

933
01:00:17,657 --> 01:00:18,876
so proud.

934
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:21,400
So now we can just dance
right through.

935
01:00:24,011 --> 01:00:26,100
That sounds like a challenge.

936
01:01:11,798 --> 01:01:14,714
♪ <i>My finger is on the button</i>♪

937
01:01:14,888 --> 01:01:16,063
♪ <i>Push the button</i>♪

938
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:34,908
The Robotniks are almost
at the vault!

939
01:01:35,082 --> 01:01:37,171
We're out of time. I'm going.

940
01:01:37,345 --> 01:01:38,477
No, Sonic!

941
01:01:38,651 --> 01:01:39,826
I haven't disabled
the traps yet!

942
01:01:41,915 --> 01:01:43,482
Too late!

943
01:01:43,656 --> 01:01:46,615
Look at me! I'm running
on the wrong side of the road!

944
01:01:49,793 --> 01:01:51,446
Well, I got to take in
the sights.

945
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:53,666
Paul, John, George,
the other one!

946
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,537
Loud American coming through!

947
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,148
Excuse me. Pardon me.

948
01:01:57,322 --> 01:01:58,758
'Ello, guv'nor!
Which way to Hogwarts?

949
01:01:58,932 --> 01:02:00,368
Hear ye, hear ye!

950
01:02:00,542 --> 01:02:02,719
Sonic the Hedgehog
wants a cuppa tea!

951
01:02:02,893 --> 01:02:04,546
Hold this for me, please.

952
01:02:05,809 --> 01:02:07,158
You're not gonna make it!

953
01:02:07,332 --> 01:02:08,333
I can make it.

954
01:02:11,858 --> 01:02:13,251
You're not gonna make it!

955
01:02:13,425 --> 01:02:14,600
I'm gonna make it.

956
01:02:16,341 --> 01:02:17,516
I'm not gonna make it.

957
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:20,127
I'm not gonna make it!

958
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:26,568
Made it!Whoo!

959
01:02:28,266 --> 01:02:30,268
Excuse me. Coming through.
No time for autographs.

960
01:02:30,442 --> 01:02:31,486
Got to go, bye!

961
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:41,366
Our destiny awaits.

962
01:02:42,454 --> 01:02:44,282
Stop right there, Roboscum!

963
01:02:44,456 --> 01:02:46,675
Let's do this!Copy!

964
01:02:53,987 --> 01:02:55,554
Too slow, Eggmen.

965
01:02:55,728 --> 01:02:58,992
Now if you don't mind,
I've got to get that key.

966
01:02:59,166 --> 01:03:00,515
Whoa!

967
01:03:00,689 --> 01:03:02,691
My feet. Why can't I
use my beautiful feet?

968
01:03:02,866 --> 01:03:04,345
Heh-heh!Because...

969
01:03:04,519 --> 01:03:07,566
this vault is armed
with variable gravity.

970
01:03:09,133 --> 01:03:09,960
No kidding.

971
01:03:10,134 --> 01:03:11,918
Green goes up...

972
01:03:12,092 --> 01:03:14,268
and red takes you down... hard.

973
01:03:14,442 --> 01:03:15,617
Rockwell, listen to me.

974
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:17,576
The Robotniks are planning to--

975
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:19,665
Oh, they're planning on stealing
a second key, just like you are?

976
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:21,232
Yes, I'm aware.

977
01:03:22,755 --> 01:03:25,279
I called it
the second Commander Walters was attacked.

978
01:03:25,453 --> 01:03:26,933
So...

979
01:03:27,107 --> 01:03:29,675
thank you
for taking the bait

980
01:03:29,849 --> 01:03:31,329
and falling
right into my trap.

981
01:03:31,503 --> 01:03:33,635
I don't believe this.

982
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,420
I know, grandson.

983
01:03:35,594 --> 01:03:37,596
A woman in the military!

984
01:03:39,511 --> 01:03:40,947
Let's go.

985
01:03:42,035 --> 01:03:43,254
Go, positions!

986
01:03:43,428 --> 01:03:44,516
Full perimeter.

987
01:03:46,083 --> 01:03:47,388
Robotnik.

988
01:03:47,562 --> 01:03:49,826
Going full spandex, huh?
Who's the fossil?

989
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,134
That's my grandfather,
you dough-eating dimbecile.

990
01:03:54,308 --> 01:03:57,398
Who are they?A couple of bleeding hearts,

991
01:03:57,572 --> 01:04:00,401
here to rescue
their emotional-support animals.

992
01:04:00,575 --> 01:04:02,360
Enough! It's over.

993
01:04:02,534 --> 01:04:06,103
The only way
you're leaving here is in handcuffs.

994
01:04:06,277 --> 01:04:07,974
There is no other way out.

995
01:04:08,148 --> 01:04:10,934
You know, there might be
one other way out.

996
01:04:11,108 --> 01:04:12,500
And what is that
supposed to mean?

997
01:04:12,674 --> 01:04:14,589
Hey, big guy,
I think it's time to...

998
01:04:15,764 --> 01:04:19,072
Break glass
in case of emergency!

999
01:04:26,210 --> 01:04:29,256
Ha! Nothing can stop
Team Knuckles!

1000
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:30,518
Open fire!

1001
01:04:31,519 --> 01:04:33,391
Knuckles,
turn this stuff off!

1002
01:04:33,565 --> 01:04:34,871
Hurry!On it.

1003
01:04:36,481 --> 01:04:37,569
Uh-oh.

1004
01:04:45,185 --> 01:04:47,535
Ha! See how you like it--

1005
01:04:55,065 --> 01:04:57,110
Can you move?No, not at all.

1006
01:04:57,284 --> 01:04:59,721
Tails, can you?No, I'm stuck.

1007
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,288
We might be here a while.

1008
01:05:03,638 --> 01:05:05,902
Whoa! Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

1009
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,339
Where's the key?

1010
01:05:14,258 --> 01:05:15,476
Whoa!

1011
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:18,305
What was that?We might have a problem.

1012
01:05:19,959 --> 01:05:21,918
No, no, no, no!

1013
01:05:42,634 --> 01:05:44,723
I'm moving.

1014
01:05:45,506 --> 01:05:47,117
I'm moving!

1015
01:05:50,294 --> 01:05:52,731
You go get it, grandson!

1016
01:05:53,471 --> 01:05:54,515
Hey!

1017
01:05:54,689 --> 01:05:56,517
Oh, whoa, whoa...

1018
01:05:59,042 --> 01:06:00,913
No. No, no!

1019
01:06:01,522 --> 01:06:03,220
I'm almost there!

1020
01:06:06,049 --> 01:06:06,832
Whoa!

1021
01:06:12,011 --> 01:06:13,578
Sonic!

1022
01:06:26,634 --> 01:06:28,985
That was so not worth it!

1023
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:31,117
Ooh!

1024
01:06:34,251 --> 01:06:35,992
You okay?Yeah. You good?

1025
01:06:36,166 --> 01:06:36,905
Sonic!

1026
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,907
Hey.

1027
01:06:39,082 --> 01:06:42,302
Sonic, one,
concrete boulder, zero.

1028
01:06:43,608 --> 01:06:44,913
Thanks for the save.

1029
01:06:45,088 --> 01:06:46,611
Cutting it a little close,
don't you think?

1030
01:06:48,047 --> 01:06:49,396
Secure the room!

1031
01:06:51,398 --> 01:06:52,617
She's got the key.

1032
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:56,447
I got an idea.

1033
01:07:05,673 --> 01:07:07,110
Commander Walters.

1034
01:07:07,284 --> 01:07:08,372
Sir.

1035
01:07:08,546 --> 01:07:10,156
You're...Still alive?

1036
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:13,116
I'll die before I let that key
fall into the wrong hands.

1037
01:07:13,986 --> 01:07:15,379
Thanks for keeping it safe.

1038
01:07:15,553 --> 01:07:17,033
I'll take it from here.

1039
01:07:19,731 --> 01:07:21,559
That's an order,
Director Rockwell.

1040
01:07:25,258 --> 01:07:27,913
Now, organize
the reinforcements.

1041
01:07:29,262 --> 01:07:30,350
Yes, sir.

1042
01:07:36,095 --> 01:07:38,315
Guys, guys, I got the key.
I repeat, I got the key.

1043
01:07:38,489 --> 01:07:40,099
Now let's get out of here.

1044
01:07:44,321 --> 01:07:46,584
Commander Walters.

1045
01:07:46,758 --> 01:07:48,455
No, no. No. Wait!

1046
01:08:02,730 --> 01:08:04,167
What?

1047
01:08:04,341 --> 01:08:06,865
Tom! Everyone's clear!
Come on, let's go!

1048
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,910
You. What are you--

1049
01:08:10,608 --> 01:08:11,652
Tom!

1050
01:08:12,784 --> 01:08:14,829
Tom. Tom, what happened?

1051
01:08:15,003 --> 01:08:16,527
Speak to me. Come on.

1052
01:08:16,701 --> 01:08:18,877
Come on,
it's gonna be okay.

1053
01:08:19,051 --> 01:08:22,098
Please, please, please get up.
Hey, come on, please wake up.

1054
01:08:22,272 --> 01:08:23,882
Wake up, wake up, come on.

1055
01:08:24,578 --> 01:08:25,971
Wake up, wake up, wake up!

1056
01:08:26,667 --> 01:08:28,104
Maria.

1057
01:08:32,151 --> 01:08:33,848
What did you do?

1058
01:08:36,068 --> 01:08:38,114
What I had to.

1059
01:08:40,768 --> 01:08:42,466
Oh, my God. Tom!

1060
01:08:45,686 --> 01:08:47,384
Help me up, kid.

1061
01:08:50,213 --> 01:08:51,518
Freeze! Don't move!

1062
01:08:51,692 --> 01:08:56,567
Any tricks up your sleeve,
Captain Grandtastic?

1063
01:09:03,313 --> 01:09:05,358
We got what we came for.

1064
01:09:06,098 --> 01:09:08,970
Great job, Shadow.

1065
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:12,583
We have both keys.

1066
01:09:12,757 --> 01:09:15,542
So where's your little
science project?

1067
01:09:16,935 --> 01:09:20,895
It's closer than you think,
my boy.

1068
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:24,595
Welcome...

1069
01:09:24,769 --> 01:09:28,120
...to my masterpiece!

1070
01:09:31,036 --> 01:09:32,777
I must hand it to GUN.

1071
01:09:32,951 --> 01:09:36,389
They built her
to my exact specifications.

1072
01:09:36,563 --> 01:09:37,738
It's...

1073
01:09:39,392 --> 01:09:40,959
remarkable!

1074
01:09:41,133 --> 01:09:42,352
Mm-hmm.

1075
01:09:42,526 --> 01:09:45,355
Astounding!Yes.

1076
01:09:46,486 --> 01:09:48,619
That's my genius grand-genome!

1077
01:09:48,793 --> 01:09:52,405
And I have one more surprise.

1078
01:09:54,886 --> 01:09:58,890
It's a new suit!

1079
01:10:08,465 --> 01:10:09,292
Gee.

1080
01:10:28,833 --> 01:10:31,227
♪ <i>I'm a chip</i>
<i>Off the old block</i>♪

1081
01:10:31,401 --> 01:10:33,490
♪ <i>I'm a chip</i>
<i>Off the old block</i>♪

1082
01:10:33,664 --> 01:10:36,449
♪ <i>I'm a chip off</i>
<i>The old block!</i>♪

1083
01:10:38,103 --> 01:10:40,018
What do you want, Stone?
I'm busy.

1084
01:10:40,192 --> 01:10:43,195
Doctor, I have a bad feeling
about this.

1085
01:10:43,369 --> 01:10:46,329
I don't think your grandfather's
been completely honest with us.

1086
01:10:46,503 --> 01:10:48,200
It was something Shadow said.

1087
01:10:48,983 --> 01:10:50,202
<i>There's more to their plan.</i>

1088
01:10:51,638 --> 01:10:54,685
How dare you!

1089
01:10:54,859 --> 01:10:57,644
You have been jealous
of my long-lost grand-Pop-Tart

1090
01:10:57,818 --> 01:10:59,951
since the very beginning!

1091
01:11:00,125 --> 01:11:02,780
I no longer require
your obsequious groveling.

1092
01:11:02,954 --> 01:11:05,435
<i>Consider this your notice</i>
<i>of termination.</i>

1093
01:11:05,609 --> 01:11:09,003
Your letter of reference
will be L for Loser.

1094
01:11:09,177 --> 01:11:11,005
Of course,
I'll expect you to stay on

1095
01:11:11,179 --> 01:11:12,659
until you've been
successfully cloned.

1096
01:11:12,833 --> 01:11:16,315
But you and I are done!

1097
01:11:16,489 --> 01:11:18,926
Like a blackened
catfish dinner!

1098
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:22,365
Sir, it's too dangerous and
I'm not there to protect you.

1099
01:11:22,539 --> 01:11:23,670
I already lost you once! I--

1100
01:11:23,844 --> 01:11:25,977
Unsubscribe.
Blocked and reported.

1101
01:11:27,195 --> 01:11:29,110
I can't lose you again.

1102
01:11:35,552 --> 01:11:37,118
Do the honors...

1103
01:11:37,858 --> 01:11:39,033
grandson.

1104
01:11:40,948 --> 01:11:42,254
Here we go.

1105
01:13:16,522 --> 01:13:18,263
It'll be okay, Sonic.

1106
01:13:18,437 --> 01:13:20,091
It'll be okay?

1107
01:13:20,265 --> 01:13:22,789
Tom is fighting for his life
and you think it'll be okay?

1108
01:13:22,963 --> 01:13:26,184
The fox is simply trying
to comfort you.

1109
01:13:26,358 --> 01:13:28,229
Comfort's not
what I need right now.

1110
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:31,537
I need to stop them.
By any means necessary.

1111
01:13:31,711 --> 01:13:32,886
Wait, you don't mean--

1112
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:35,149
The Master Emerald.

1113
01:13:35,323 --> 01:13:38,501
The Emerald must never be
wielded for vengeance.

1114
01:13:38,675 --> 01:13:39,719
Not ever!

1115
01:13:39,893 --> 01:13:41,547
We swore a sacred oath.

1116
01:13:41,721 --> 01:13:43,680
Don't talk to me about oaths.
Not now!

1117
01:13:43,854 --> 01:13:45,725
But you told Tom
using the Emerald

1118
01:13:45,899 --> 01:13:47,335
wasn't the right choice.

1119
01:13:47,510 --> 01:13:49,599
Well, now it's the only choice.

1120
01:13:49,773 --> 01:13:51,557
And if neither of you
have the guts to help me,

1121
01:13:51,731 --> 01:13:53,167
then I'll do it alone.

1122
01:13:53,341 --> 01:13:55,431
But I thought
the three of us were a team.

1123
01:13:55,605 --> 01:13:57,607
I thought that's what
made us special.

1124
01:13:57,781 --> 01:13:59,565
I'm not asking you twice,
Knuckles.

1125
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:03,264
Where is the Master Emerald?

1126
01:14:05,005 --> 01:14:08,356
Your heart is being consumed
by anger, hedgehog.

1127
01:14:08,531 --> 01:14:11,577
You are in no condition
to make decisions right now.

1128
01:14:11,751 --> 01:14:14,319
I know you're upset about Tom.
We all are.

1129
01:14:14,493 --> 01:14:16,190
Last chance.

1130
01:14:16,364 --> 01:14:18,976
Where... is it?

1131
01:14:19,542 --> 01:14:21,065
Don't do this.

1132
01:14:27,724 --> 01:14:30,683
Part of our oath
is to trust each other.

1133
01:14:30,857 --> 01:14:33,077
And I must abide
by that promise,

1134
01:14:33,251 --> 01:14:35,558
even if you have chosen
to break it.

1135
01:14:35,732 --> 01:14:37,473
But heed this warning:

1136
01:14:37,647 --> 01:14:40,998
The Master Emerald is guarded
by a fearsome warrior.

1137
01:14:41,172 --> 01:14:43,348
And to seize
this ultimate power,

1138
01:14:43,522 --> 01:14:45,437
you will have to go...

1139
01:14:45,611 --> 01:14:47,657
through him.

1140
01:14:49,136 --> 01:14:51,748
Okay, Wade...
all comes down to this.

1141
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:54,141
Last few seconds.

1142
01:14:54,315 --> 01:14:55,447
Whipple down the ice.

1143
01:14:55,621 --> 01:14:59,146
He shoots... he scores!

1144
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:02,367
Wade Whipple
is a champion again!

1145
01:15:08,286 --> 01:15:11,463
Oh, hey, Sonic. See my goal?
Pretty sick, right?

1146
01:15:11,637 --> 01:15:13,465
I'm here for the Emerald.

1147
01:15:13,639 --> 01:15:15,162
Look, Sonic, I'm sorry.

1148
01:15:15,336 --> 01:15:17,513
I promised to guard this emerald
with my life.

1149
01:15:17,687 --> 01:15:19,515
I will do whatever it takes--

1150
01:15:20,646 --> 01:15:21,734
Well, I tried.

1151
01:15:27,174 --> 01:15:28,175
Sonic!

1152
01:15:32,092 --> 01:15:33,093
Too bright!

1153
01:15:36,706 --> 01:15:39,752
<i>This is an urgent </i>
<i>national emergency broadcast.</i>

1154
01:15:39,926 --> 01:15:42,363
<i>A spacecraft designed</i>
<i>by the agency GUN</i>

1155
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:45,453
<i>has been hijacked and launched </i>
<i>out of the River Thames.</i>

1156
01:15:51,242 --> 01:15:54,288
<i>All residents are urged </i>
<i>to seek immediate shelter.</i>

1157
01:16:16,354 --> 01:16:18,617
It's time, Shadow.

1158
01:16:20,271 --> 01:16:24,362
Professor, is this really
what Maria would have wanted?

1159
01:16:27,147 --> 01:16:30,498
The question isn't
what Maria would have wanted.

1160
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:33,632
It's what do they deserve.

1161
01:16:34,633 --> 01:16:37,114
Remember what she meant to us.

1162
01:16:38,985 --> 01:16:41,901
Remember what they took from us.

1163
01:16:52,346 --> 01:16:53,391
Kids!

1164
01:16:53,565 --> 01:16:55,480
We have to go, now!

1165
01:17:00,703 --> 01:17:03,140
They want to take
Shadow away from us, Maria!

1166
01:17:11,757 --> 01:17:14,455
Hey! Hey! What are you doing?
Those are children.

1167
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,414
We've got our orders, Walters!Stand down!

1168
01:17:40,264 --> 01:17:41,482
Huh?

1169
01:17:43,049 --> 01:17:44,137
Maria!

1170
01:18:31,619 --> 01:18:34,622
Excuse me,
Grand Paso Doble.

1171
01:18:34,797 --> 01:18:37,756
What is that thermonuclear
gerbil doing?

1172
01:18:37,930 --> 01:18:40,280
Infusing the core...

1173
01:18:40,454 --> 01:18:41,934
with chaos energy.

1174
01:18:42,108 --> 01:18:44,720
That's my little secret.

1175
01:18:44,894 --> 01:18:47,505
The Eclipse Cannon
is about to turn this planet

1176
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:50,464
into a flaming pile
of rubble,

1177
01:18:50,638 --> 01:18:55,469
wiping out everything
in a 25,000-mile radius.

1178
01:18:58,646 --> 01:19:00,823
Including us.

1179
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:06,002
What?

1180
01:19:06,916 --> 01:19:10,006
We can't annihilate
the Earth!

1181
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:14,619
Hmm?By combining our genius,
we can rule humanity.

1182
01:19:14,793 --> 01:19:15,707
Together!

1183
01:19:15,881 --> 01:19:18,971
Humanity is a failed experiment.

1184
01:19:19,145 --> 01:19:21,365
If anyone should know that,
it's you.

1185
01:19:23,106 --> 01:19:26,022
All your life, you've been
rejected by this world.

1186
01:19:26,892 --> 01:19:28,546
You have nothing down there.

1187
01:19:30,156 --> 01:19:32,202
No one who cares about you.

1188
01:19:33,986 --> 01:19:35,553
But I have you now.

1189
01:19:38,251 --> 01:19:39,644
We're family.

1190
01:19:40,558 --> 01:19:42,168
We have each other.

1191
01:19:43,648 --> 01:19:44,910
Oh, Ivo...

1192
01:19:46,738 --> 01:19:48,435
you're no Maria.

1193
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:55,747
The moment I lost her,
my family was gone forever!

1194
01:19:57,401 --> 01:19:59,142
The only way
to give Maria's life meaning

1195
01:19:59,316 --> 01:20:01,579
is to destroy the world
that took her from me.

1196
01:20:02,449 --> 01:20:04,582
So I'm burning it all down!

1197
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:08,455
It's done.

1198
01:20:08,629 --> 01:20:10,936
Good work, Shadow.

1199
01:20:11,110 --> 01:20:12,982
I'm prepping
the firing sequence.

1200
01:20:13,156 --> 01:20:17,029
The weapon will be fully charged
in ten minutes.

1201
01:20:20,990 --> 01:20:23,079
It's almost finished, Maria.

1202
01:20:23,993 --> 01:20:26,343
You will have justice.

1203
01:20:30,738 --> 01:20:32,044
What is that?

1204
01:20:32,958 --> 01:20:35,918
Is GUN launching
missiles at us?

1205
01:20:36,092 --> 01:20:39,138
Impossible.
It's moving too fast.

1206
01:20:42,359 --> 01:20:43,882
It's him.

1207
01:20:52,369 --> 01:20:56,677
You hurt my family.
This ends now!

1208
01:20:56,852 --> 01:20:58,549
Now you know my anger.

1209
01:20:58,723 --> 01:21:01,595
The pain I've felt
for 50 years.

1210
01:21:01,769 --> 01:21:05,034
And you've made
the same choice I did.

1211
01:21:05,208 --> 01:21:06,774
I'm nothing like you!

1212
01:21:06,949 --> 01:21:08,037
We'll see.

1213
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:17,481
Show yourself, coward!

1214
01:21:49,295 --> 01:21:50,949
You were right about one thing.

1215
01:21:52,820 --> 01:21:55,171
This ends now.

1216
01:22:21,762 --> 01:22:22,807
What's happening?

1217
01:22:22,981 --> 01:22:24,113
Where are they?

1218
01:22:25,157 --> 01:22:26,419
Up there.Where?

1219
01:22:26,593 --> 01:22:27,507
Higher.Hmm?

1220
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:30,510
Left yourself open.

1221
01:22:30,684 --> 01:22:32,469
Ivo! What are you doing?

1222
01:22:32,643 --> 01:22:34,036
Thwarting your evil plan!

1223
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,918
Not the mustache!Agreed.

1224
01:22:47,092 --> 01:22:49,790
Let go on three.
One, two, three!

1225
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:58,234
Oh... a nano-fist.

1226
01:22:58,408 --> 01:23:02,107
I haven't seen that
since I hate-watched <i>Green Lantern</i>in 2011.

1227
01:23:02,281 --> 01:23:04,240
I was saving it for Comic-Con.

1228
01:23:04,414 --> 01:23:06,459
But now there won't
be a Comic-Con!

1229
01:23:29,091 --> 01:23:32,137
Why are you alone?
Where are your friends?

1230
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:36,402
They tried to stop you,
didn't they?

1231
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:38,056
But you came anyway.

1232
01:23:38,230 --> 01:23:40,667
Your anger was too much.

1233
01:23:40,841 --> 01:23:43,583
What kind of hero
abandons his friends

1234
01:23:43,757 --> 01:23:45,803
to pursue revenge?

1235
01:23:45,977 --> 01:23:48,284
Abandons his family!

1236
01:23:48,458 --> 01:23:51,069
Don't you dare talk
about my family.

1237
01:23:51,243 --> 01:23:53,985
And here I thought
you cared for them.

1238
01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:57,293
Especially the one...
What's his name?

1239
01:23:57,467 --> 01:23:58,685
Tom?

1240
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:27,453
Go ahead. Finish it!

1241
01:24:29,151 --> 01:24:31,501
What are you waiting for? Do it!

1242
01:24:31,675 --> 01:24:34,243
I'm right here!

1243
01:24:35,418 --> 01:24:37,550
You didn't let your pain
change who you are...

1244
01:24:38,986 --> 01:24:40,031
in here.

1245
01:24:48,474 --> 01:24:50,433
This is not who I am.

1246
01:24:51,129 --> 01:24:52,783
What are you doing?

1247
01:24:52,957 --> 01:24:55,829
You won. Take your revenge.

1248
01:24:57,701 --> 01:24:59,833
There are no winners
with revenge.

1249
01:25:13,151 --> 01:25:14,892
<i>Wow.</i>

1250
01:25:15,066 --> 01:25:16,502
Look at all those stars.

1251
01:25:17,982 --> 01:25:19,592
<i>They're like diamonds.</i>

1252
01:25:21,855 --> 01:25:25,207
The last time I sat
beneath stars like this...

1253
01:25:27,209 --> 01:25:28,775
I was with her.

1254
01:25:30,342 --> 01:25:32,866
I've felt this pain for so long.

1255
01:25:34,564 --> 01:25:36,261
It's all I know.

1256
01:25:36,435 --> 01:25:38,655
When I lost Longclaw...

1257
01:25:38,829 --> 01:25:40,526
I felt the same way.

1258
01:25:42,311 --> 01:25:44,748
Did your pain eventually
go away?

1259
01:25:44,922 --> 01:25:46,880
No.

1260
01:25:47,054 --> 01:25:48,969
But in time,
I learned there's something

1261
01:25:49,144 --> 01:25:51,450
even more powerful than pain.

1262
01:25:51,624 --> 01:25:53,713
The love we felt for each other.

1263
01:25:54,932 --> 01:25:56,760
That's what you need
to hold on to, Shadow.

1264
01:25:56,934 --> 01:25:59,154
Maria might be gone,

1265
01:25:59,328 --> 01:26:01,330
but your love
will always remain.

1266
01:26:15,996 --> 01:26:20,000
"The light shines
even though the star is gone."

1267
01:26:31,838 --> 01:26:33,753
This whole mess
is my fault.

1268
01:26:33,927 --> 01:26:36,756
I've been so blinded by rage,
I thought...

1269
01:26:37,453 --> 01:26:39,237
I had no choice.

1270
01:26:42,762 --> 01:26:45,156
You always have a choice.

1271
01:26:50,117 --> 01:26:52,859
But making the right one
is never easy.

1272
01:26:53,033 --> 01:26:54,731
One more thing I learned

1273
01:26:54,905 --> 01:26:57,690
is that when you
really screw something up,

1274
01:26:57,864 --> 01:26:59,344
you can't fix it
on your own.

1275
01:27:14,533 --> 01:27:16,187
Gotta go fast.

1276
01:27:16,361 --> 01:27:18,711
Don't tell me you've
got a catchphrase.

1277
01:27:18,885 --> 01:27:22,237
That's right, new hedgehog.
And everyone loves it.

1278
01:27:37,991 --> 01:27:41,168
I... will... not... try...

1279
01:27:41,343 --> 01:27:44,302
...to stop... my...
elders... from...

1280
01:27:44,476 --> 01:27:46,870
destroying... the... world!

1281
01:27:52,528 --> 01:27:54,443
Playtime is over.

1282
01:28:03,147 --> 01:28:05,367
There's no going back now.

1283
01:28:09,545 --> 01:28:11,895
Set up defense.

1284
01:28:13,853 --> 01:28:15,159
Damn you, autocorrect!

1285
01:28:21,034 --> 01:28:22,079
Mantis!

1286
01:28:24,037 --> 01:28:25,300
Oh!

1287
01:28:28,694 --> 01:28:29,782
Whee!

1288
01:28:31,871 --> 01:28:34,483
I'm right here,
arach-nerd.

1289
01:28:44,971 --> 01:28:47,713
That's what I call
mantis-scaping.

1290
01:28:47,887 --> 01:28:50,325
That's elder abuse!

1291
01:28:56,418 --> 01:28:59,638
<i>Alert! Alert! Alert!</i>

1292
01:28:59,812 --> 01:29:01,205
Shadow...

1293
01:29:01,379 --> 01:29:03,990
I see you've chosen betrayal.

1294
01:29:05,165 --> 01:29:07,820
And you were once
so useful to me.

1295
01:29:23,532 --> 01:29:25,708
Ready to recycle
some tin cans?

1296
01:29:25,882 --> 01:29:27,492
Just try to keep up.

1297
01:29:58,784 --> 01:30:00,177
Please, Grampsy,

1298
01:30:00,351 --> 01:30:02,092
don't do this!

1299
01:30:02,266 --> 01:30:04,355
Sorry, kiddo.

1300
01:30:04,529 --> 01:30:07,750
Bring Your Grandkid to Work Day
is over.

1301
01:30:13,930 --> 01:30:15,714
Any last words?

1302
01:30:15,888 --> 01:30:18,587
Just one thing...

1303
01:30:19,588 --> 01:30:21,677
that I never thought I'd say.

1304
01:30:21,851 --> 01:30:23,330
What is it?

1305
01:30:23,505 --> 01:30:25,985
"I love you"?

1306
01:30:26,638 --> 01:30:27,944
No.

1307
01:30:28,118 --> 01:30:30,033
It was something even better.

1308
01:30:30,207 --> 01:30:32,296
But I'm not gonna say it
if that's the way you're gonna be.

1309
01:30:32,470 --> 01:30:34,429
Okay. Bye.

1310
01:30:47,311 --> 01:30:49,182
Grandchildren.

1311
01:30:49,356 --> 01:30:52,969
All the fun
and none of the responsibility.

1312
01:30:55,101 --> 01:30:57,887
Who said life was pointless?

1313
01:30:58,670 --> 01:31:01,586
Huh?Oh, right. You did.

1314
01:31:07,418 --> 01:31:08,941
Victory!

1315
01:31:09,115 --> 01:31:11,466
Say what you want
about my granddad,

1316
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:13,468
he made one
hell of a bug zapper.

1317
01:31:15,687 --> 01:31:17,515
We got to stop that laser!

1318
01:31:17,689 --> 01:31:19,909
I knew there was something
I was forgetting.

1319
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:33,662
We're out of time.
The cannon is about to fire!

1320
01:31:33,836 --> 01:31:35,054
Where are you?

1321
01:31:35,228 --> 01:31:37,753
Oh, you know,
just making friends.

1322
01:31:37,927 --> 01:31:39,624
They're all yours.

1323
01:31:48,328 --> 01:31:49,852
Follow me!

1324
01:31:55,945 --> 01:31:58,513
Now, this might hurt a little!

1325
01:32:12,352 --> 01:32:15,138
So this was your plan?

1326
01:32:15,312 --> 01:32:16,835
Yeah...

1327
01:32:17,009 --> 01:32:20,491
Would someone mind
shutting down the giant death ray?

1328
01:32:22,928 --> 01:32:24,756
We can't stop the cannon
from firing...

1329
01:32:24,930 --> 01:32:27,019
But we can steer it away
from the Earth.

1330
01:32:27,193 --> 01:32:29,544
Coming around to starboard.Aye-aye, Doc.

1331
01:32:33,504 --> 01:32:35,550
Here we go.

1332
01:32:36,768 --> 01:32:38,596
It's a little tight.

1333
01:32:39,379 --> 01:32:41,599
Definitely not power steering.

1334
01:32:47,518 --> 01:32:50,434
Keep... turning.

1335
01:32:53,045 --> 01:32:54,873
Jump in anytime here, guys!

1336
01:33:00,531 --> 01:33:04,361
Can't... hold... much... longer.

1337
01:33:21,987 --> 01:33:23,119
Yes!

1338
01:33:23,293 --> 01:33:25,556
I did it! I did it!

1339
01:33:28,864 --> 01:33:30,561
Oh!Ooh!

1340
01:33:31,214 --> 01:33:32,345
Look what you did!

1341
01:33:32,519 --> 01:33:35,131
Hey, look down there!Sonic!

1342
01:33:41,224 --> 01:33:43,313
Oh, Knuckles,
please tell me you have a--

1343
01:33:43,487 --> 01:33:45,184
Last one.

1344
01:33:45,358 --> 01:33:46,751
Let's make it count.

1345
01:33:49,319 --> 01:33:51,364
Ready for a little base of ball?

1346
01:33:52,409 --> 01:33:54,019
Deep breath.

1347
01:33:54,193 --> 01:33:56,892
One... two... three!

1348
01:34:18,740 --> 01:34:20,872
Really!What's happening?

1349
01:34:21,046 --> 01:34:23,527
The reactor core is overloading.

1350
01:34:23,701 --> 01:34:26,051
It's only a matter of time
before it blows.

1351
01:34:26,225 --> 01:34:27,966
So what does that mean
for Earth?

1352
01:34:28,140 --> 01:34:30,795
A radioactive atmosphere.

1353
01:34:30,969 --> 01:34:33,450
Rain that kills the crops
and melts your flesh.

1354
01:34:33,624 --> 01:34:34,886
Other than that...

1355
01:34:35,060 --> 01:34:36,714
We're not done here!

1356
01:34:36,888 --> 01:34:38,803
You try to stabilize
the reactor.

1357
01:34:38,977 --> 01:34:40,196
Buy me some time.

1358
01:34:40,370 --> 01:34:42,415
I'll push the station
away from Earth

1359
01:34:42,589 --> 01:34:44,026
before it explodes.

1360
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:48,204
This is our last chance
to do the right thing.

1361
01:34:49,858 --> 01:34:52,469
Go with God

1362
01:34:52,643 --> 01:34:54,863
stinking hedgehog.

1363
01:34:56,125 --> 01:34:58,431
<i>Core integrity failing.</i>

1364
01:35:07,614 --> 01:35:09,268
I've got you, Sonic!

1365
01:35:42,606 --> 01:35:46,001
<i>Initializing</i>
<i>reactor core stabilizers.</i>

1366
01:36:04,715 --> 01:36:07,413
This is Doctor Ivo Robotnik,

1367
01:36:07,587 --> 01:36:10,329
dedicating my final livestream

1368
01:36:10,503 --> 01:36:13,245
to one very special henchman:

1369
01:36:13,855 --> 01:36:15,247
<i>Agent Stone.</i>

1370
01:36:15,421 --> 01:36:17,641
No, no. Doctor, wait!

1371
01:36:17,815 --> 01:36:20,209
<i>If I can't</i>
<i>rule the world...</i>

1372
01:36:21,210 --> 01:36:23,038
I might as well save it...

1373
01:36:23,212 --> 01:36:26,345
for the one and only person
who ever cared about me.

1374
01:36:26,519 --> 01:36:28,434
Don't do this, Doctor, please!

1375
01:36:28,608 --> 01:36:32,221
Stone, you were more
than a sycophant to me.

1376
01:36:35,093 --> 01:36:36,355
You were...

1377
01:36:37,835 --> 01:36:39,358
a syco-friend.

1378
01:36:44,929 --> 01:36:48,454
I'll miss your lattes
with steamed Austrian goat milk.

1379
01:36:50,413 --> 01:36:52,284
I love the way you make 'em!

1380
01:37:35,371 --> 01:37:39,201
So... I guess there's
only one thing left to say.

1381
01:37:43,988 --> 01:37:45,468
It's been a real drag.

1382
01:37:46,164 --> 01:37:47,644
Thanks for nothing.

1383
01:38:06,228 --> 01:38:07,403
Sonic, look.

1384
01:38:17,630 --> 01:38:19,502
Shadow and Robotnik.

1385
01:38:19,676 --> 01:38:21,896
They sacrificed
themselves...

1386
01:38:22,070 --> 01:38:24,072
to save everyone.

1387
01:38:24,811 --> 01:38:26,857
You always have a choice.

1388
01:38:28,119 --> 01:38:30,861
Guys, I'm really sorry
for running off like that.

1389
01:38:31,035 --> 01:38:32,645
I shouldn't have
left you behind.

1390
01:38:34,430 --> 01:38:36,040
The truth is...

1391
01:38:36,214 --> 01:38:38,869
you're the best teammates
a hedgehog could ever ask for.

1392
01:38:40,610 --> 01:38:42,438
And the best friends.

1393
01:38:42,612 --> 01:38:44,483
Can you ever forgive me?

1394
01:38:48,574 --> 01:38:50,359
Team Sonic?

1395
01:38:54,450 --> 01:38:57,061
How about just "team"?

1396
01:39:05,374 --> 01:39:06,984
Goodbye, Doctor.

1397
01:39:23,522 --> 01:39:25,829
Big finish.Mmm!

1398
01:39:27,352 --> 01:39:29,789
Now that's
what I call teamwork.

1399
01:39:29,964 --> 01:39:31,748
Okay! It's ready!

1400
01:39:34,925 --> 01:39:36,579
Knuckles,
how could you?

1401
01:39:36,753 --> 01:39:38,581
Gotta be faster than that!

1402
01:39:39,495 --> 01:39:40,583
Give me a break.

1403
01:39:40,757 --> 01:39:42,063
Still moving a little slow
over here.

1404
01:39:42,237 --> 01:39:44,021
Donut Lord!Yay!

1405
01:39:45,892 --> 01:39:48,547
Okay, Knuckles, that's...I am having the love.

1406
01:39:48,721 --> 01:39:50,071
I want the love!

1407
01:39:50,245 --> 01:39:52,943
Aww...Get in here, Ozzy.

1408
01:39:53,117 --> 01:39:54,814
It's great
to be back together.

1409
01:39:54,989 --> 01:39:56,816
We're stronger than ever.

1410
01:39:56,991 --> 01:39:59,428
And nothing is gonna
stand in our way.

1411
01:40:00,777 --> 01:40:04,607
Except that one piece
of unfinished business.

1412
01:40:13,659 --> 01:40:16,662
And way out in front, to the
surprise of absolutely no one,

1413
01:40:16,836 --> 01:40:18,012
it's the Blue Blur!

1414
01:40:18,186 --> 01:40:19,926
Often imitated,
never duplicated,

1415
01:40:20,101 --> 01:40:21,319
the one, the only...

1416
01:40:22,407 --> 01:40:23,887
Let's do this!

1417
01:40:24,061 --> 01:40:26,237
Yeah!

1418
01:40:26,411 --> 01:40:29,501
All right, boys,
try and keep up.

1419
01:42:25,922 --> 01:42:29,447
Sonic the Hedgehog
is Family Champion once again!

1420
01:42:30,100 --> 01:42:31,145
Tails?

1421
01:42:31,710 --> 01:42:33,234
Knuckles?

1422
01:42:34,887 --> 01:42:37,847
Okay. Yeah, I overshot
the finish line.

1423
01:42:46,769 --> 01:42:49,772
Okay,
so how do I get back?

1424
01:43:01,175 --> 01:43:02,263
Pro tip:

1425
01:43:02,437 --> 01:43:03,655
If you're gonna take a shot

1426
01:43:03,829 --> 01:43:05,962
at the fastest creature
in the universe...

1427
01:43:08,312 --> 01:43:09,922
you'd better not miss.

1428
01:43:13,752 --> 01:43:16,364
Um... I'm flattered
by the cosplay,

1429
01:43:16,538 --> 01:43:18,235
but you got
a few details wrong.

1430
01:43:18,409 --> 01:43:21,282
I can't blame you, though.
It's hard to copy perfection.

1431
01:43:31,379 --> 01:43:33,381
That's a neat trick.

1432
01:43:45,306 --> 01:43:47,221
What? Who are you?
