368
00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:11,435
[dragon whispering]
<i> Help us, Ping, help us.</i>

369
00:20:11,571 --> 00:20:13,735
<i> Only you can help us.</i>

370
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:17,113
Me? But I'm just a servant.

371
00:20:17,248 --> 00:20:19,448
<i> You are not a servant, Ping.</i>

372
00:20:20,577 --> 00:20:21,619
[Ping gasps]

00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,816

377
00:20:36,496 --> 00:20:39,127
[Ping breathing heavily]

378
00:20:42,204 --> 00:20:43,869
What is that?

379
00:20:44,305 --> 00:20:46,104
The Dragon Stone.

380
00:20:46,707 --> 00:20:49,874
One of the Honored Guests
has died.

381
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,643
No, Ping!

382
00:20:52,778 --> 00:20:54,209
Ping, wait!
Wait! Stay here!

383
00:20:54,345 --> 00:20:56,577
-[thunder rumbling]
-[Lao Ma] Don't go out there!

384
00:20:56,712 --> 00:20:57,616
What is it?

385
00:20:57,751 --> 00:21:00,852
[thunder rumbling]
[rain pattering]

386
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,321
[Master Lan] Hurry!

387
00:21:06,457 --> 00:21:09,395
We have to get the body out
before it loses its quality!

388
00:21:09,531 --> 00:21:11,995
You are making me lose money!

389
00:21:13,004 --> 00:21:14,068
Quickly, men!

390
00:21:14,204 --> 00:21:15,705
Hurry up! Hurry up!

391
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,970
[thunder rumbling]

392
00:21:18,339 --> 00:21:21,202

[horse neighs]

394
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,398
Bring me
something to carve it up.

395
00:21:42,364 --> 00:21:44,329
Get to task with it.

396
00:21:44,465 --> 00:21:46,803
[continues indistinctly]

397
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:49,538

[thunder rumbles]

399
00:21:53,643 --> 00:21:55,676
[Master Lan]
Don't damage the scales.

400
00:21:55,811 --> 00:21:58,443
[continues indistinctly]
[Hua Hua squeaking]

401
00:21:58,578 --> 00:22:01,275
Don't look. [sobbing]

402
00:22:05,487 --> 00:22:07,322
[dragon]<i> Help us, Ping.</i>

403
00:22:07,457 --> 00:22:11,120
<i> Help us. Only you can help us.</i>

404
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:14,728
[sobs] I can't.

405
00:22:15,694 --> 00:22:17,731
[Ping crying softly]

406
00:22:19,466 --> 00:22:21,537

[cart rumbling]

416
00:23:28,501 --> 00:23:29,305
[Ping gasps]

417
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,339
Watch where you're going, girl,

418
00:23:31,475 --> 00:23:34,170
if you don't want to get hurt.

419
00:23:38,173 --> 00:23:40,710
Ping, where were you last night?

420
00:23:40,846 --> 00:23:43,111
-I...
-Never mind.

421
00:23:43,414 --> 00:23:46,420
Take this to
the Great Lord in the main room

422
00:23:46,555 --> 00:23:48,921
and don't do anything silly.

423
00:23:49,056 --> 00:23:53,662
He is from Chang'an,
from the Imperial Palace.

424
00:23:54,297 --> 00:23:55,829
Hurry, hurry!

425
00:23:57,335 --> 00:24:00,003
[Master Lan] No, no! Have mercy!

426
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:02,437
Your excellency, please!

427
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,265
It's not my fault!
I didn't kill it!

428
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,674
You must understand.
It's all the iron.

429
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,269
-It poisons them, I beg of you!
-You there.

430
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:10,379
-[Master Lan] Have mercy!
-Don't let it go cold.

431
00:24:10,514 --> 00:24:11,743
[man] It's not going to be easy

432
00:24:11,878 --> 00:24:13,810
to bring
the dragon into the cage.

433
00:24:13,945 --> 00:24:15,650
It's too risky, Master Diao.

434
00:24:15,786 --> 00:24:17,417
We need to clear
the ice and bring the cage

435
00:24:17,553 --> 00:24:18,819
before the inner gates.

436
00:24:18,954 --> 00:24:22,751
The iron here
blocks the dragon's magic.

437
00:24:23,387 --> 00:24:25,920
Surely your man
can handle Long Danzi

438
00:24:26,056 --> 00:24:27,828
in his weakened condition.

439
00:24:27,963 --> 00:24:30,833
[man] To kill him
would be easy enough, but...

440
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:34,196
to force him into that cage
is another matter entirely.

441
00:24:34,332 --> 00:24:36,870
Long Danzi must
reach Chang'an alive.

442
00:24:37,006 --> 00:24:40,070
[grunts] His blood must
be fresh for the ritual.

443
00:24:40,205 --> 00:24:44,148
[man] We can't
underestimate the dragon.

444
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:47,379
Well, don't just
stand there, girl.

445
00:24:47,515 --> 00:24:48,948
Bring it here.

446
00:24:50,381 --> 00:24:53,788
The Emperor's life
hangs in the balance.

447
00:24:53,923 --> 00:24:57,759
I'm afraid we must
be on our way tomorrow.

448
00:24:59,565 --> 00:25:03,160
Haven't you been
taught any manners, girl?

449
00:25:03,296 --> 00:25:07,131
Do you not know how
to use your right hand?

450
00:25:08,031 --> 00:25:09,501
Or is it something else?

451
00:25:09,637 --> 00:25:10,703
[Hua Hua squeaking]

452
00:25:10,838 --> 00:25:12,335
[Ping gasps]
[Hua Hua squeaks]

453
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:17,581
Perhaps a left-handed
girl in a house of dragons.

454
00:25:18,548 --> 00:25:19,907
It can't be a coincidence.

455
00:25:20,043 --> 00:25:21,281
[Hua Hua squeaking]

456
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:22,685
[Ping gasps]

457
00:25:23,882 --> 00:25:26,018

00:25:28,457 --> 00:25:30,025
[pot clatters]

459
00:25:30,394 --> 00:25:32,992
[gasps] Wha...what?

460
00:25:34,859 --> 00:25:36,460
[Diao chuckles]

461
00:25:36,696 --> 00:25:38,232
Well, well, well.

462
00:25:39,134 --> 00:25:41,501
I think we may have
just discovered the solution

463
00:25:41,636 --> 00:25:43,630
to your problem, Captain.

464
00:25:44,466 --> 00:25:47,578
[mysterious music]
[doors rumbling]

465
00:26:08,926 --> 00:26:11,327
[door creaking]

466
00:26:11,595 --> 00:26:14,336
[man] This place was
designed to keep dragons in,

467
00:26:14,471 --> 00:26:15,495
not to take them out.

468
00:26:15,631 --> 00:26:18,500
[Diao] My dear captain,
as far as I know,

469
00:26:18,635 --> 00:26:21,938
there are no left-handed
people left in the empire.

470
00:26:22,074 --> 00:26:25,877
So this brave little girl here

471
00:26:26,012 --> 00:26:28,476
will give us a hand, won't you?

472
00:26:29,219 --> 00:26:30,621
S-sir?

473
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:36,984
You will convince
Long Danzi to come with us

474
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,853
to help the Emperor.

475
00:26:38,988 --> 00:26:40,693
Long Danzi?

476
00:26:41,196 --> 00:26:45,365
The strongest and
last of all Imperial dragons.

477
00:26:46,168 --> 00:26:50,674
He has one final service
to render for his majesty.

478
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:56,245
The Emperor
has need of his blood!

479
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:59,474
[Danzi roaring]

480
00:27:01,551 --> 00:27:04,314
[Ping breathing heavily]

481
00:27:05,818 --> 00:27:07,823
[Diao chuckles]

482
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:09,690
Calm down.

483
00:27:09,992 --> 00:27:13,257
It was merely
a simple experiment.

484
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:17,866
You see, Captain?

485
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:22,067
Now, I'm sure Long Danzi
will cooperate tomorrow.

486
00:27:22,403 --> 00:27:26,536
Dragons are strangely
attached to their Dragonkeepers.

487
00:27:26,671 --> 00:27:30,641
He won't let her die,
even if it means his own life.

488
00:27:30,777 --> 00:27:33,475
[Diao laughs]

489
00:27:34,044 --> 00:27:35,653
Foolish creature.

490
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:38,953
[tense dramatic music]

491
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,122

[music continues]
[footsteps thudding]

497
00:28:05,947 --> 00:28:09,214
[Diao] Oh, here he comes, girl.

498
00:28:09,948 --> 00:28:11,946
How exciting.

499
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:15,158
[footsteps thumping]
[Danzi growls]

500
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:17,458

[soldiers grunting]

502
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:26,927
[chuckles] I think our friend
needs a little encouragement.

[Ping groans]

-Well done. Well done.
-[Ping groaning]

506
00:28:33,402 --> 00:28:35,373
I believe we have his attention.

507
00:28:35,508 --> 00:28:38,781
-[Hua Hua squeaking]
-[Diao gasps] Oh, how sweet.

508
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:42,047
Even the vermin
comes out to protect you.

509
00:28:42,183 --> 00:28:43,652
[Hua Hua whimpers]
[Diao chuckles]

510
00:28:43,787 --> 00:28:47,254
Nobody wants to see you suffer.

511
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:48,250
No!

512
00:28:48,386 --> 00:28:50,926
-Honored Guest!
-[growling]

513
00:28:51,493 --> 00:28:52,290
Heave!

514
00:28:54,662 --> 00:28:55,994
No, no!

515
00:28:56,129 --> 00:28:57,994
-Lift the gate!
-[roaring]

516
00:28:58,129 --> 00:28:59,833
Don't go in the cage!

517
00:28:59,968 --> 00:29:02,897
[dramatic music]
[Diao] That's it.

518
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:04,099
Lovely.

519
00:29:04,502 --> 00:29:07,209
-[Ping grunting]
-[Diao] Nearly there.

520
00:29:07,344 --> 00:29:08,545
One more.

Honored Guest!

529
00:29:34,632 --> 00:29:36,735
-I've got a clear shot, sir.
-[man] Wait.

Go after the dragon.

If you please, Master Diao,

I should carry
it for safekeeping.

I'm a servant.

I can do what I want

669
00:37:23,372 --> 00:37:25,601

You can do it alone.

Okay, so you're listening.

697

What is this qi thing?
Why do I have it?

[Danzi wincing]

792
00:43:07,781 --> 00:43:09,946
<i>And did you pay good attention?</i>

793
00:43:10,081 --> 00:43:11,615
-More or less.
<i> -Ooh!</i>

794
00:43:11,751 --> 00:43:13,983
So you told me about qi,

795

my other questions?

<i> Ping, are you all right?</i>

823
00:45:23,587 --> 00:45:26,146
Something's wrong with Kai.

824
00:45:26,282 --> 00:45:28,450
[Danzi]<i> Hold on tight!</i>

825
00:45:29,818 --> 00:45:33,253
[Emperor] You've been of
great service, Master Diao.

826
00:45:33,388 --> 00:45:35,995
You shall be amply rewarded.

827
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:39,895
My reward is to serve,
Your Majesty.

828
00:45:40,298 --> 00:45:42,869
In fact, there is
a further service

829
00:45:43,005 --> 00:45:46,839
I may be allowed
to render, Your Majesty.

830
00:45:47,241 --> 00:45:50,441
The ancient scrolls
speak of the secrets

831
00:45:50,577 --> 00:45:55,081
of immortality being hidden
in the Pearl of Longevity.

832
00:45:55,217 --> 00:45:59,250
If Your Majesty
would allow me to perform--

833
00:46:01,054 --> 00:46:03,749
What do you think
about that, son?

834
00:46:03,885 --> 00:46:06,327
You'd like to pore over
the ancient scrolls too,

835
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:07,287
wouldn't you?

836
00:46:07,422 --> 00:46:08,897
The scroll said that immortality

837
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:12,132
is the gods' reward
for a virtuous life,

838
00:46:12,267 --> 00:46:15,935
but to seek it for oneself
is to defy the gods.

839
00:46:16,071 --> 00:46:18,704
So there you have it,
Master Diao.

840
00:46:18,973 --> 00:46:21,536
We should not anger the gods.

841
00:46:21,672 --> 00:46:26,046
Please forgive my foolishness,
Your Majesty.

842
00:46:27,011 --> 00:46:28,044
I only wish that--

843
00:46:28,179 --> 00:46:30,578
Master Diao, you look tired,

844
00:46:31,214 --> 00:46:32,815
you deserve some rest.

845
00:46:32,951 --> 00:46:34,252
Write some poetry

846
00:46:34,387 --> 00:46:39,092
or go back to your little
insects and butterflies.

847
00:46:40,927 --> 00:46:43,129
Thank you, Your Majesty.

848
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:45,059
Thank you.

849
00:46:45,194 --> 00:46:47,336
[ominous music]

850
00:46:47,472 --> 00:46:50,603
Poetry, butterflies.

851
00:46:50,739 --> 00:46:52,937
Of course, Your Majesty.

852
00:46:53,373 --> 00:46:56,736
Always at your service,
Your Majesty.

853
00:46:57,605 --> 00:47:01,279
Oh! I can't stand this anymore.

854
00:47:03,721 --> 00:47:05,511
Soon I will show Your Majesty

855
00:47:05,646 --> 00:47:09,089
the true face of
a god among men.

856
00:47:10,126 --> 00:47:13,087
-[low rumbling]
-Oh yes, Your Majesty.

857
00:47:13,222 --> 00:47:15,161
Soon you will pay.

858
00:47:17,533 --> 00:47:19,693
Soon. [chuckles]

859
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:23,565

Wang Chao! [groans]
Where are you?

864
00:48:01,479 --> 00:48:02,509
Where are you?

[hammer clanging]

866
00:48:03,537 --> 00:48:06,247
Oh, welcome back, Master!

867
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:08,314
I--Whoa!

868
00:48:08,583 --> 00:48:12,585
Oh! I do hope that you had
a pleasant trip! [chuckling]

869
00:48:12,721 --> 00:48:14,479
Whoa! Ow! Ooh!

870
00:48:14,882 --> 00:48:17,458
Not like the one
I just had. [chuckles]

871
00:48:17,593 --> 00:48:18,627
Any delays?

872
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:21,363
How was the, uh, the weather?
[grunts]

873
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:24,191
Is it ready?

874
00:48:24,327 --> 00:48:27,035
Yes, it's ready, Master.

875
00:48:28,133 --> 00:48:31,098
[Wang Chao groaning]

876
00:48:31,233 --> 00:48:32,203
[body thuds]

877
00:48:32,339 --> 00:48:35,103
But are you sure
this is wise, Master?

878
00:48:35,338 --> 00:48:37,936
How dare you question me!

879
00:48:38,072 --> 00:48:40,912
If it weren't for me,
you'd be in jail or dead!

880
00:48:41,047 --> 00:48:42,641
Or a mixture of both.

881
00:48:43,044 --> 00:48:46,482
Sorry! Yeah, yeah. Good point.
Yeah, it's ready.

882
00:48:46,617 --> 00:48:48,621
[stammering]
And it's wise and good.

883
00:48:48,756 --> 00:48:50,290
Oh, finally.

884
00:48:50,959 --> 00:48:53,624
Finally my time draws near.

885
00:48:54,327 --> 00:48:58,561
Soon I will join the gods!
[laughs]

886
00:48:59,969 --> 00:49:01,898
I just need to get the pearl.

887
00:49:02,033 --> 00:49:02,870
The pearl?

888
00:49:03,005 --> 00:49:04,671
-[mysterious music]
-Uh...

889
00:49:04,807 --> 00:49:08,072
Oh! No. Oh, I know.

Yes, yes, yes, yes! [laughs]

[Wang Chao shouts]

892
00:49:12,315 --> 00:49:14,879
I'll poison the water
in the palace! [laughs]

[Wang Chao shouts]

894
00:49:15,848 --> 00:49:16,748
Oh no.

[Wang Chao sighs]

896
00:49:17,853 --> 00:49:19,081
No, that won't work.

[Diao] Oh, ha ha! I know.

901
00:49:27,622 --> 00:49:29,228
I'll create a monkey spider

902
00:49:29,364 --> 00:49:33,161
and train it to
steal the pearl, that-

903

-[Diao groans]
-[vases shatter]

904

No, that will take too long!

I haven't got time for that.

How can I get the...

907
00:49:42,645 --> 00:49:44,446
Wang Chao!

908
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:46,477
Yes, Master?

909
00:49:46,613 --> 00:49:49,408
Is there something
you would like to tell me?

910
00:49:49,544 --> 00:49:51,281
Um, no, uh, nothing.

911
00:49:51,416 --> 00:49:52,454
Can't--can't think of anything.

912
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:55,321
[laughs] Really?

913
00:49:57,157 --> 00:49:59,493
I'm hearing them again.

914
00:49:59,728 --> 00:50:00,887
[Diao] Hmm.

915
00:50:02,865 --> 00:50:04,660
Well, my old friend.

916
00:50:05,795 --> 00:50:08,732
This is what
you're going to do.

917
00:50:09,368 --> 00:50:12,034
[Danzi]<i> There it is, Chang'an.</i>

918
00:50:12,569 --> 00:50:15,371
<i> It is extremely well guarded.</i>

919
00:50:15,507 --> 00:50:17,805
-We need a plan.
-[Danzi]<i> Yes.</i>

920
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:20,573
<i> You must always</i>
<i> look before you leap.</i>

921
00:50:20,709 --> 00:50:22,784
-But--
-[Danzi]<i> Hang on!</i>

922
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:24,916
[Ping] Thanks for the--whoa!

923
00:50:25,051 --> 00:50:26,455
[Ping shouting]

924
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:28,618
[dramatic music]

925
00:50:40,264 --> 00:50:42,929
[Ping coughing]

926
00:50:46,073 --> 00:50:48,009
You should... [coughs]

927
00:50:48,144 --> 00:50:50,603
-say something!
-[Danzi chuckles]

928
00:50:50,738 --> 00:50:52,980
<i>You must always be alert, Ping.</i>

929
00:50:53,116 --> 00:50:57,119
[Ping]
Oh! Stop being so dragon.

930
00:50:58,317 --> 00:51:00,285
I'm not laughing about it.

931
00:51:00,421 --> 00:51:02,517
You are always
doing whatever you want.

932
00:51:02,653 --> 00:51:05,186
-[Danzi chuckles]
-Great, great.

933
00:51:05,321 --> 00:51:06,627
Now I'm soaking.

934
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:08,658
[Danzi roars]

935
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,731
Nice. Very nice.

936
00:51:11,866 --> 00:51:12,734
Thank you.

937
00:51:13,203 --> 00:51:15,230
[Danzi]
<i> You're welcome.</i> [laughs]

938
00:51:15,366 --> 00:51:17,231
[Ping groans] Danzi!

939
00:51:17,367 --> 00:51:20,271
[Danzi roars]

940
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:23,370
[sighs] I can't
stand this anymore.

941
00:51:23,505 --> 00:51:25,207
[mysterious music]

942
00:51:25,343 --> 00:51:27,039
What is this place?

943
00:51:27,174 --> 00:51:30,149
[Danzi]
<i> Wu Ching. A very old place.</i>

944
00:51:30,284 --> 00:51:31,945
<i> It holds the memories of a war</i>

945
00:51:32,081 --> 00:51:35,448
<i> that happened</i>
<i> a long, long time ago.</i>

946
00:51:35,617 --> 00:51:37,753
[Hua Hua squeaking]

947
00:51:38,586 --> 00:51:39,689
[Ping] A war?

948
00:51:40,092 --> 00:51:40,954
Really?

949
00:51:42,623 --> 00:51:44,025
Who are they?

950
00:51:44,327 --> 00:51:47,529
[Danzi]<i> Well, the humans called</i>
<i> them the Necromancers.</i>

951
00:51:47,664 --> 00:51:49,667
<i> They caused great suffering</i>

952
00:51:49,803 --> 00:51:52,838
<i> and it took us great suffering</i>
<i> to defeat them.</i>

953
00:51:52,973 --> 00:51:54,875
And this is you?

954
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:56,503
[Danzi]<i> He was our king.</i>

955
00:51:56,639 --> 00:51:58,074
<i> He was mortally wounded.</i>

956
00:51:58,209 --> 00:52:02,543
<i> But we flew him across the</i>
<i> ocean to the waters of life.</i>

957
00:52:02,679 --> 00:52:05,520
<i> They can heal all wounds.</i>

958
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,246
<i> It was during this war</i>

959
00:52:07,382 --> 00:52:11,620
<i> that humans and dragons</i>
<i> first fought side by side.</i>

960
00:52:11,756 --> 00:52:15,725
But then why did
they put you in cages?

961
00:52:17,097 --> 00:52:19,058
[Danzi sighs]

962
00:52:29,208 --> 00:52:30,770
What? What is it?

963
00:52:31,372 --> 00:52:33,910
[Danzi]<i> The entrance to</i>
<i> Wu Ching is sealed.</i>

964
00:52:34,046 --> 00:52:37,450
<i> Its tunnels run deep</i>
<i> under the Imperial palace.</i>

965
00:52:37,585 --> 00:52:38,914
<i> We would have to break</i>
<i> the seal--</i>

966
00:52:39,049 --> 00:52:41,855
No, no, no! Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait!

967
00:52:41,991 --> 00:52:43,588
Ping, get behind me.

968
00:52:44,657 --> 00:52:47,988
Long Danzi,
you don't recognize me?

969
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:50,791
-[Danzi]<i> What?</i>
-Lu Yu's Dragonkeeper

970
00:52:50,927 --> 00:52:52,459
-from way back when.
-[Ping gasps]

971
00:52:52,594 --> 00:52:53,994
A Dragonkeeper.

972
00:52:54,828 --> 00:52:56,528
[Danzi]<i> Wang Chao?</i>

973
00:52:56,663 --> 00:52:58,770
[Danzi chuckles]

974
00:52:59,239 --> 00:53:01,408
Oh, you must be Ping.

975
00:53:02,511 --> 00:53:05,043
You can't go through
the Imperial seal, Danzi.

976
00:53:05,179 --> 00:53:06,882
It's too dangerous.

977
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:09,747
A dragon full of qi in Wu Ching?

978
00:53:09,882 --> 00:53:12,483
I mean, I can't even
begin to think what will happen.

979
00:53:12,619 --> 00:53:15,587
And it, it's forbidden.
[chuckles]

980
00:53:15,722 --> 00:53:19,258
Oh, Old Wang
knows a way to get in there.

981
00:53:19,393 --> 00:53:21,496
-Ha ha!
-[Danzi]<i> Ah.</i>

982
00:53:21,931 --> 00:53:23,897
[mysterious music]

983
00:53:24,033 --> 00:53:26,532
[Wang Chao humming]

984
00:53:35,043 --> 00:53:37,111
Ta-da! [chuckles]

985
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:41,648
[sighs] Only for small people.
Only for Wang.

986
00:53:42,084 --> 00:53:44,748
Maybe a little girl.

987
00:53:46,583 --> 00:53:48,453
Oh! Oh, look at that!

988
00:53:48,589 --> 00:53:50,755
Ha! Fortune favors us.
[chuckles]

989
00:53:50,891 --> 00:53:52,961
[Danzi]<i> She can't go</i>
<i> alone into the palace.</i>

990
00:53:53,097 --> 00:53:54,787
<i> She's just a little girl.</i>

991
00:53:54,922 --> 00:53:56,792
I'm not just a little girl.

992
00:53:56,927 --> 00:54:00,469
You must trust in Lu Yu.
She chose Ping.

993
00:54:00,871 --> 00:54:03,034
[growls softly]

994
00:54:03,637 --> 00:54:06,264
He will not hesitate
to attack us.

995
00:54:07,201 --> 00:54:11,104
They are very
dangerous animals.

996
00:54:12,047 --> 00:54:13,244
-[coughs]
-Father,

997
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:15,583
the pearl is losing color.

998
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:18,010
How long is it going to last?

999
00:54:18,146 --> 00:54:21,521
Until it is of no
use to me. [coughs]

1000
00:54:24,323 --> 00:54:25,585
Your Majesty.

1001
00:54:26,254 --> 00:54:30,530
[emperor continues coughing]
[tense music]

1002
00:54:35,367 --> 00:54:36,895
[Wang Chao] Ta-da!

1003
00:54:37,031 --> 00:54:40,100
Wu Ching, the Forgotten City.

1004
00:54:44,106 --> 00:54:48,074
Mmm. What you did
before with that boulder,

1005
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:52,084
with your hands,
with your face so focused.

1006
00:54:52,219 --> 00:54:54,183
It was awesome!

1007
00:54:54,886 --> 00:54:58,118
[laughs] Yeah,
it was, wasn't it?

1008
00:54:59,228 --> 00:55:03,189
But I can't control my qi.

1009
00:55:03,658 --> 00:55:06,128
Maybe you...

1010
00:55:06,964 --> 00:55:10,497
Maybe I could
teach you a trick or two?

1011
00:55:10,632 --> 00:55:11,497
You would?

1012
00:55:11,666 --> 00:55:13,700
Hmm, yeah.

1013
00:55:14,202 --> 00:55:16,970
But this is going
to be very dangerous.

1014
00:55:17,106 --> 00:55:19,876
This city is
very sensitive to qi.

1015
00:55:20,178 --> 00:55:24,085
And we can awaken old spirits
if too much is released.

1016
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:27,021
Let's see if you can invite

1017
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:30,155
these fireflies
into this basket.

1018
00:55:30,291 --> 00:55:31,159
Start with that one.

1019
00:55:31,294 --> 00:55:32,885
[Ping] This is gonna be so fun.

1020
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:36,794
But...but h-how do I use it?

1021
00:55:38,167 --> 00:55:40,726
Don't try to use your qi.

1022
00:55:40,862 --> 00:55:43,337
Let it flow through you.

1023
00:55:43,473 --> 00:55:46,670
The qi is the wind.
You are the sail.

1024
00:55:46,806 --> 00:55:49,043
Too little qi,
and the ship won't move.

1025
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,303
Too much and it will sink.

1026
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:54,474
I could move that rock.

1027
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:58,517
Not because I'm powerful, but
because I was able to feel it.

1028
00:55:58,653 --> 00:56:01,949
So should I feel
about the fireflies?

1029
00:56:02,085 --> 00:56:04,249
[Wang Chao]
You should, you must.

1030
00:56:04,384 --> 00:56:06,520
You must feel
everything around you.

1031
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,929
[Ping gasps]

1032
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:09,226
Thank you, Wang Chao.

1033
00:56:09,361 --> 00:56:10,562
Thank you.

1034
00:56:10,997 --> 00:56:13,368
It's a pity we didn't
find you sooner, you know?

1035
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:14,926
Because you're
such a great teacher.

1036
00:56:15,062 --> 00:56:16,229
We're lucky to have you

1037
00:56:16,364 --> 00:56:19,236
and I'm sure
that everything will be fine.

1038
00:56:19,371 --> 00:56:20,266
Ping, I...

1039
00:56:25,577 --> 00:56:28,281
Breathe, Ping. [inhales]

1040
00:56:28,416 --> 00:56:30,818
Fill your lungs with compassion.

1041
00:56:30,953 --> 00:56:32,421
Hey? Hmm?

1042
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:35,921
That will allow you
to feel the firefly.

1043
00:56:36,057 --> 00:56:37,855
Hmm.

1044
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:42,288
-[mysterious music]
-There, good. Yeah.

1045
00:56:43,164 --> 00:56:44,290
Be careful!

1046
00:56:44,793 --> 00:56:46,501
[Wang Chao gasps]

1047
00:56:47,928 --> 00:56:49,002
[Ping] What is it?

1048
00:56:49,137 --> 00:56:50,568
Oh, those...

1049
00:56:50,703 --> 00:56:52,667
those--those are
the Necromancers.

1050
00:56:52,802 --> 00:56:54,839
Shh, don't wake them!

1051
00:56:55,507 --> 00:56:57,076
They are dead?

1052
00:56:57,245 --> 00:56:58,577
Dead, asleep.

1053
00:56:58,712 --> 00:57:01,115
Doesn't matter.
Always dangerous.

1054
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,618
We have to hurry! Come on.

1055
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:08,985
We must be in position
before Danzi gets here.

1056
00:57:10,791 --> 00:57:13,190
Let's try to fill
a basket on the way.

1057
00:57:13,325 --> 00:57:14,628
Whoa!

1058
00:57:15,197 --> 00:57:16,663
Whoa, steady.

1059
00:57:18,832 --> 00:57:21,703
If I learn how
to control the qi,

1060
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:24,933
it means I'm a Dragonkeeper!

1061
00:57:25,069 --> 00:57:29,270
[Wang Chao laughs]
Ah, so young.

1062
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:31,540
Yeah, Dragonkeeper. Good.

1063
00:57:31,676 --> 00:57:33,541
[crickets chirping]

1064
00:57:33,677 --> 00:57:36,375
[tense music]

1065
00:57:49,661 --> 00:57:52,167
[suspenseful music]

1066
00:57:52,303 --> 00:57:54,328
Dragon attack! Dragon attack!

1067
00:57:54,464 --> 00:57:57,264
-[soldier] Dragon attack!
-[soldier 2] Dragon attack!

1068
00:57:57,399 --> 00:57:59,739
-[drums pounding]
-[soldier 3] Dragon attack!

1069
00:57:59,874 --> 00:58:04,909
[dramatic music]
[soldiers shouting indistinctly]

1070
00:58:08,108 --> 00:58:10,486
Wait until he's in range!

1071
00:58:12,418 --> 00:58:13,919
Get ready!

1072
00:58:14,322 --> 00:58:16,954
[music continues]

1073
00:58:23,629 --> 00:58:25,897
[soldiers shouting]

1074
00:58:26,762 --> 00:58:28,999
[water crashing]

1075
00:58:32,836 --> 00:58:33,940
[soldier] Wait for it!

1076
00:58:34,076 --> 00:58:34,873
Now!

1077
00:58:35,805 --> 00:58:36,978
[Danzi roars]

1078
00:58:37,113 --> 00:58:39,042
[drums pounding]

1079
00:58:40,782 --> 00:58:43,446
-Remember the plan?
-Yes, Teacher.

1080
00:58:43,581 --> 00:58:44,810
Be careful.

1081
00:58:44,945 --> 00:58:46,687

One has principles.

But you don't
have a choice, Old Wang.

1086
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:19,511
Not now.
Master Diao, he did save you.

1087
00:59:19,646 --> 00:59:23,316
And he can turn you
into a legless centipede.

It's not safe, Your Highness.

1097
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:13,870
You'll serve your majesty better
by following his commands.

1098
01:00:14,005 --> 01:00:16,203
But I always obey his commands,

1099
01:00:16,339 --> 01:00:18,378
yet he never
lets me do anything!

1100
01:00:18,513 --> 01:00:20,605
This is not fair! Why?

1101
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:23,878
I have to obey everything

The dragon's broken through.
It's getting closer.

1105
01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:41,166
Your Majesty, we must
move you to a safer location.

1106
01:00:41,302 --> 01:00:45,771
Is the Imperial throne
not safe for the son of heaven?

1107
01:00:45,907 --> 01:00:49,000
Get out there
and stop the dragon.

1108

I didn't mean

You should be
ashamed of yourself.

1133

What you did to
the Honored Guests is very bad.

1134
