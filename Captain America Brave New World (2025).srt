00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000


2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000


3
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,660
Sir, one minute warning.

4
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,500
Congratulations again.

5
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,660
Heard anything from Betty,
from my daughter?

6
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,670
No, sir.
We tried her several times.

7
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,460
Okay.

8
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,570
Thank you.

9
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,490
All right, New Hampshire,

10
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,530
we are moments away.

11
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,660
Are you ready?

12
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,610
Ready for Ross!
Ready for Ross!

13
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,640
Ready for Ross!
Ready for Ross!

14
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,680
Ready for Ross!
Ready for Ross!

15
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,630
Ladies and gentlemen,

16
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,660
the next President of
the United States of America,

17
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,490
Thaddeus Ross!

18
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:50,630
Thank you.

19
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,550
Tonight, America has spoken

20
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:01,550
in one of the most important
elections of our lifetimes.

21
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:05,480
We've recognized the urgency
of this moment.

22
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,650
From the disappearance
of half of mankind

23
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:12,640
to the emergence
of a celestial mass

24
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,640
in the Indian Ocean,

25
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:18,660
the threats we face show
no signs of slowing down.

26
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:24,680
But the only way we can
overcome them is together!

27
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,470
Tonight, President Ross

28
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:28,660
embraced
the theme of togetherness

29
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,480
in his acceptance speech,

30
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,500
but his past
tells a different story,

31
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,570
especially when it comes to
working with heroes

32
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,670
like Captain America.

33
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,550
As two of our nation's
most important leaders,

34
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,560
some question
if they can overcome

35
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,670
their at-times
tumultuous history

36
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,630
to face the challenges ahead.

37
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:45,630
Here you go, Cap.

38
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,640
During his time as a...

39
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,440
Put your money away.
It's on the house.

40
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,550
Thanks, Charlie.

41
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,490
...leading to Ross

42
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,660
being branded with the moniker
of "the Hulk Hunter."

43
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,610
Following Hulk
and the Abomination's

44
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,680
destruction of Harlem,

45
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,530
Ross was criticized
for what some called

46
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,610
"an unwarranted outburst"
during a press conference.

47
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,520
In fact, many blamed Ross
for the collateral damage,

48
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,480
believing it was his
relentless pursuit

49
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,670
of Banner's Hulk
that led to the rampage.

50
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,480
It also resulted in
the President-elect's

51
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,620
estrangement from
his daughter,

52
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,520
Doctor Betty Ross,
Bruce Banner's ex-girlfriend.

53
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,670
But in a surprising turn
of events,

54
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,560
he managed to
shift the narrative,

55
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,560
and silence
his harshest critics

56
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,590
by apprehending
the man responsible

57
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:29,670
for the Abomination.

58
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,550
How we lookin' down there?

59
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,530
Well, SERPENT mercenaries

60
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,480
entered with a package
about an hour ago.

61
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,550
They're handing it
to the buyer any minute.

62
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,440
We know what they're carrying?

63
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,680
That is classified
per the White House.

64
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,560
Of course it is.

65
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,450
Where's Eagle-One?
We have strike authorization.

66
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,680
Eagle-One is entering
the target airspace now.

67
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,560
Upload the compound's
covert entry points.

68
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,480
Covert? Really?
You must be new.

69
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,650
Wait for it.

70
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,570
Sam, SEAL team
is six minutes out.

71
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:56,570
Copy that.

72
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,470
How the hell
did he just do that?

73
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,620
Cap's gear was a gift
from the Wakandans

74
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,620
for helping them out.

75
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,580
I heard even the wrapping
paper was made of vibranium.

76
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,560
No, man. I'm kidding. Come on.

77
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,450
Joaquin, Redwing's pickin' up
hostages inside.

78
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,620
-I'm goin' in.
-Negative.

79
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,660
The package is the priority.

80
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,590
Have
the SEALs track the package.

81
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,470
I'm on the hostages.

82
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,620
Redwing, send them a scan
of the building.

83
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,530
What is it?

84
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,560
That's Sidewinder.

85
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,550
He's the head of SERPENT.

86
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,500
He's not supposed to be here.

87
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,620
Ah.

88
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,660
You're praying, Padre.

89
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:07,680
Padre.

90
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:17,540
Padre. Padre, Padre, Padre.

91
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:33,630
Kill them.

92
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,470
- No. No!
- Kill them one at a time.

93
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:38,650
Silencio!

94
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,670
Captain America is here.

95
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:40,650
Do you copy?

96
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,610
Move, move, move!

97
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:45,460
Vámonos, vámonos.

98
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,630
Get the package outta here.

99
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,670
SERPENT's on the move
with the canister, Sam.

100
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,630
I'm kinda busy right now!

101
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,670
Redwing, on my mark.

102
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,470
Stop.

103
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,670
Stay back!
Or we'll shoot them.

104
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,460
SERPENT's gettin' farther away
with the canister, Sam,

105
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,620
and Sidewinder's
headed to the chapel.

106
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,550
I already know
what you're trying to do.

107
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,490
You can't be at two places
at once.

108
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,630
All right, this time.

109
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,460
But don't get yourself killed.

110
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,460
No dying. Copy that.

111
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,650
Buyer didn't show.

112
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,560
Looks like you need
better clients.

113
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,500
You don't need to worry.

114
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,560
I'll find whoever
wasted my time.

115
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,490
You have bigger concerns.

116
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,600
The Captain America
I dreamt of killing

117
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,620
was bigger than you.

118
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,570
I'm happy to disappoint.

119
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,620
I bet you break easy.

120
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,580
Not that easy.

121
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,580
Not that hard.

122
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,530
I heard your rib go.

123
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,520
You need a minute?

124
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,570
Nope. Nope,
let's get this over with.

125
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,550
I got shit to do today.

126
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,620
Whoo-hoo!

127
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,670
Damn.

128
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,540
Nobody saw that.

129
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,470
Sam, package is secured.

130
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,630
I'll add your star
to my collection.

131
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,570
Need a minute?

132
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,500
That's what I thought.

133
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,640
Save some for us, Cap.

134
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,670
He has a fractured arm,
so be gentle.

135
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,550
"Keep your face

136
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,440
always to the sunshine,

137
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,520
and the shadows
will fall behind you."

138
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,660
The quote was Betty's idea.

139
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,660
She's still not speaking
with you?

140
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,680
No.

141
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,520
She doesn't believe
I've changed.

142
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,530
Really changed.

143
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,610
I don't think I'm gonna get
another shot.

144
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:28,580
Comin' up on the end of
my first hundred days, Leila.

145
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,600
They're gonna define me.

146
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,520
This treaty's gotta work.

147
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,450
Hello.

148
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,480
Mr. President,
the mission was a success.

149
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,440
All right, fill me in.

150
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,620
Cap and the
SEAL team saved the hostages.

151
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,680
The package is secure
and en route to the US.

152
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,480
How's your brother?

153
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,640
Oh, wow, you remember.

154
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,560
-He's in the Air Force.
-Yeah.

155
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,450
Probably 'cause of you.

156
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,650
I try not to hold that
against him.

157
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,590
It's a weird place

158
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,460
-for a handoff, right?
-Mm-hmm.

159
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,440
Wide open, soft perimeter.

160
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,650
You think the buyer
ever intended on showin' up?

161
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,530
You think SERPENT got played?

162
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,550
What are they sayin'?

163
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,630
Same thing.
Contract was anonymous.

164
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:14,680
Fifty mil to steal the
canister en route to Japan.

165
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,620
Then show up here
and meet the buyer.

166
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:18,490
Hmm.

167
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,460
Let us know if you get a trace
on Sidewinder.

168
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,590
-Good work.
-Thank you.

169
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,660
You'll notice, I did not die,

170
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,440
and people are saying
I did not die in style.

171
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,480
Who is saying that?

172
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:36,650
-People.
-What people?

173
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,660
Everybody.

174
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,560
Everybody is saying that.

175
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,540
Look, tell me I don't make
your old gear look brand-new.

176
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,660
You've got on the greaves
upside down.

177
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,490
I'm joking.

178
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,630
You look good, man.

179
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,460
All right. Fair enough.

180
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,580
That means that
you're finally gonna

181
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,590
introduce me to Ant-Man?

182
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,640
Nope.

183
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:54,660
Well, at least
you gotta teach me

184
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,460
your aerial kick, man.

185
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,520
Look, if I'm gonna be Falcon,
I gotta know everything.

186
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,480
In no way
are you ready for that.

187
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,460
But I got a guy who'll
teach you the fundamentals

188
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,470
from the ground up

189
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:05,490
Absolutely.

190
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,480
Now, he's not a people person.

191
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,450
So you gotta learn
how to keep your mouth shut.

192
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,490
Can you do that?

193
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,540
He's gonna love me, bro!
Are you kidding me?

194
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,640
-That's not the right answer.
-He's gonna love me.

195
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,640
What's up, OG?

196
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,480
Who's the pretty boy?

197
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,680
"Pretty boy"? You didn't
tell gramps about me?

198
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,450
I'm the new Falcon.

199
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,630
-No, you're not.
-Yes, I am.

200
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,600
This is Joaquin Torres.

201
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,550
Been workin' with him
for three years.

202
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:36,520
I haven't figured out
how to shut him up yet.

203
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,610
So what are we doing here?
Orthopedics? Uh...

204
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,630
How to relearn how to walk
after you break a hip?

205
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,470
Oh, sh--

206
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,470
Oh, shit.

207
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,590
That's Isaiah Bradley.

208
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,650
The-- The Isaiah Bradley?

209
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,440
You brought me to
the forgotten Cap?

210
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,460
Why didn't you say something?

211
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,470
It is a pleasure to meet you.

212
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:00,640
Your missions in Korea
are legendary.

213
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,530
And what, and after that,
no action?

214
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,640
I mean, a lot's changed
in the world.

215
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,500
We could've used
another super soldier.

216
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,580
The United States government

217
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,640
threw me in prison
for 30 years.

218
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,670
They experimented on me
for decades.

219
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,530
Yikes, that's-- that sucks.

220
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,600
Can we start?

221
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,580
Let's do it.

222
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,490
No vibranium wings,

223
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,560
no shield,
no super soldier serum.

224
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,550
I wanna see
if he's got three in him.

225
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,540
Get those flags, Sam!

226
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,620
Cap v Cap!

227
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,680
That's one.

228
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,480
Let's go!

229
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,460
Orthopedic.

230
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,680
That's two.

231
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,590
I'm sorry.
What were you sayin'?

232
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,450
See? Not a people person.

233
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:03,470
-In a fight, the last hit...
-Is the only hit that matters.

234
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:04,670
I know. Shut up, but thanks.

235
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,620
All right, that's it.
Tag me in. I'm ready.

236
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,520
Captain America doesn't
get to take five. Let's go.

237
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,640
I need to take this.

238
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,680
I'm not takin' five.

239
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,460
-You still got the plastic on.
-No! I don't...

240
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,540
Maybe I wanted it on there.

241
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,670
Oh, you want me
to make the text bigger?

242
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,590
So you can read it?

243
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,520
Yeah, I'll hold
for the President.

244
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,440
Where you going?

245
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,540
You wanna talk about it?

246
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:51,600
It just doesn't
sit right with me.

247
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:55,500
Captain America,
answering to the President.

248
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,660
The President of the country
who stole your life?

249
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,440
It's not just that.

250
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,660
We're talkin' about
Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross.

251
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,650
Son of a bitch
earned that nickname, too.

252
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:07,450
Look, I know, Isaiah,
firsthand.

253
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,590
Remember,
Ross threw me in the Raft.

254
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:12,540
Hounded me, Steve and Natasha
for years.

255
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,530
So why are you
workin' for him?

256
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,620
As long as you do,

257
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,680
Captain America
stands for people like him.

258
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,570
You've got no business
workin' for the government.

259
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,500
You see what's going on
out there?

260
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,640
The country is lost.

261
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,660
Standing next to
the President,

262
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,490
even if it's Ross...

263
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,640
it gives people hope.

264
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,570
Now, come on,
give me some credit.

265
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,580
I have a friend who works
in the White House.

266
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,560
She'll let me know if Ross
starts acting out of turn.

267
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,440
None of this means
I forgot about you.

268
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,600
I see what you're doin'.

269
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,470
What?

270
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:49,610
Pullin' that counseling
bullshit on me.

271
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,450
Look, trust me.

272
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,550
My eyes are wide open on
this, okay?

273
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:58,520
I know Ross will never change,

274
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,550
but he is the President.

275
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,650
So you gonna tell me
what he wanted

276
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,610
or are you plannin' on
makin' me guess?

277
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:09,620
He invited Joaquin and I
to the White House,

278
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,540
and I said
under one condition.

279
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,610
If he extended an invitation
to you as well.

280
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,530
I know you're gonna say no,

281
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,580
but it would mean a lot to me
if you were there.

282
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,640
We just...

283
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:25,500
gotta get you a suit.

284
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:26,670
I have a damn suit.

285
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,500
For real?

286
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,600
Then why are you
always wearin'

287
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,520
that ratty-ass sweatsuit?

288
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,460
Come on,
you gonna come or what?

289
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,480
See, Isaiah? This is
what I'm talking about.

290
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,660
Now you're going to
the White House. Look at that.

291
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,520
- You look good, OG.
- Wow, man. Damn.

292
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,440
I told you I was gonna get you
out of those sweats.

293
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,620
Look at you now, man.

294
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,470
Yeah, I didn't know
Men's Warehouse
made that size.

295
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,650
Hey, Faith and I
got married in this.

296
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,580
Okay, all right, all right.

297
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,600
I'm sure she would be proud.

298
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,450
I hope so.

299
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,640
Feels strange to walk right
into the belly of the beast.

300
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,620
Hey, I'm sure
it can't be easy.

301
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,600
It ain't.

302
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,650
Which is why
we gotta celebrate.

303
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:12,530
I don't care
if it is Ross in charge.

304
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,540
We are guests of honor
at the White House, man!

305
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,660
- When does that ever happen?
- Right.

306
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,540
And they sent us a limo, man.

307
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,610
What?

308
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,550
And we look good.

309
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,530
- Yeah.
- What?

310
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,550
Old school,
you got your smell-good on.

311
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:24,580
What?

312
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,530
And you got
the houndstooth on.

313
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,650
And we got the good stuff.

314
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:31,450
It's party time.

315
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,440
Captain America!

316
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,660
Captain, Captain, over here.

317
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,500
- Cap, over here!
- Mr. Bradley.

318
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:48,530
Over here!

319
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,660
-Hey, Isaiah. Check it out.
-Oh.

320
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,540
Whoa, man, look at this!

321
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,470
Oh, we gotta get a pic.

322
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,490
Let's do it.

323
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,620
Tres amigos on three.

324
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,630
Uno, dos, tres. Ah!

325
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,600
Yeah, that's my
new wallpaper. Look at that.

326
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,630
- Pretty good.
- It's good?

327
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,610
Can you send it to me?

328
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,520
Yeah, I'll AirDrop it to you
right now.

329
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,520
You do know
what AirDrop is, right?

330
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,540
Of course,
I know what AirDrop is.

331
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,500
What's AirDrop?

332
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,640
You see, you should have it.

333
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,520
Just hit "Accept"
and it pops up.

334
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,520
- I did that.
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

335
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,480
The President
needs Mr. Wilson.

336
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,590
I'll see you guys inside.

337
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,610
-Hey.
-Hey.

338
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,490
Sam, just keep an open mind.

339
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,480
Why? What am I walking into?

340
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,580
Thi-- This is not
the picture you took.

341
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,440
Oh, I sent you
the wrong picture.

342
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,460
Oh, my Lord.

343
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,640
Well, that's
a very good point.

344
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,660
I'll consider it.

345
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:51,630
Wilson.

346
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,600
Folks, can you give us
the room?

347
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,620
Uh...

348
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,640
Thanks.

349
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,500
Doctor's orders.

350
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,620
Not quite a cigar,
but better than that damn gum.

351
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,640
Hmm.

352
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,660
Thanks for comin' in.

353
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,570
Welcome to the White House.

354
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,500
Well, thank you
for the invite, sir.

355
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:15,620
I have to admit, I'm still
gettin' used to the new look.

356
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,620
Yeah, well,
they said lose the mustache

357
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,470
or lose the election.

358
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,490
Thanks for your help
down in Mexico.

359
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,560
Retrieving that canister might
just have saved this treaty.

360
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,550
I was just doing my job, sir.

361
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:32,630
You and I
haven't always agreed

362
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:37,470
on how much latitude
enhanced individuals deserve.

363
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,660
But what you've accomplished

364
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,450
has given me reason
to reconsider.

365
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:46,500
Which is why I want you,
Captain America,

366
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:49,550
to help me
rebuild the Avengers.

367
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,580
-The Avengers?
-Yes, sir.

368
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,480
Well, with
all due respect, sir,

369
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,620
when you passed
the Sokovia Accords,

370
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,460
you tore the Avengers apart.

371
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,490
Why the change of heart?

372
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,440
I represent all Americans now.

373
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,660
Hell, half of 'em
wouldn't even
be here without the Avengers.

374
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,680
The country needs this.

375
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,600
And when we disagree on
how to manage a situation...

376
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,610
what happens then?

377
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,580
We figure it out together.

378
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,650
Look, you don't have to
give me an answer now.

379
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,670
Just think about it.

380
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,620
Prime Minister Ozaki.

381
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,530
-Great to see you, sir.
-And you.

382
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,600
Thank you for being here.

383
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,570
Here we are.

384
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:48,480
Sam Wilson,
Prime Minister Ozaki.

385
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,500
Not bad.

386
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:54,560
Would you like a picture?

387
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,560
Sure.

388
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,630
Sam, please.

389
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,540
Now,
stand a little bit closer.

390
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,460
-Thank you, gentlemen.
-Thank you.

391
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,570
Thank you.

392
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,620
Work with me, Sam.

393
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,620
We'll show the world
a better way forward.

394
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:19,630
That was unexpected.

395
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,560
Maybe it's an opportunity.

396
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,550
So?

397
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:29,640
How was it?

398
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,670
He asked me
to restart the Avengers.

399
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,470
Wait, what now?

400
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,630
-That's huge, man.
-I don't know.

401
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,530
We'd have to work for him.

402
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,570
Ladies and gentlemen,

403
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:43,470
the President of the
United States, Thaddeus Ross.

404
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:45,610
Good evening, everyone.
Good evening.

405
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,660
It's my great privilege
to host you

406
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:53,490
at the White House
on this historic evening.

407
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,440
When the celestial mass
emerged in the Indian Ocean,

408
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:01,570
we did what we often do.

409
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,590
We squabbled over it.

410
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:07,470
Countries rushed in
to claim it as their own,

411
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:12,450
setting up research facilities
to exploit its resources.

412
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,500
What was found
inside that island

413
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:18,560
is nothing short of
the discovery
of the millennium.

414
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:23,440
Its potential applications
in tech, in medicine,

415
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,650
in defense are immeasurable.

416
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:30,600
It's even more indestructible
than vibranium.

417
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,680
And it's not controlled
by an isolationist nation.

418
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:37,650
Ladies and gentlemen,

419
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:39,560
I present to you...

420
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,480
adamantium.

421
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:49,530
The first and only
refined sample

422
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:51,620
was stolen from
a Japanese mining site.

423
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:56,530
But happily,
it's been recovered
and is in a secure location.

424
00:23:56,550 --> 00:24:01,500
And we have two incredibly
brave men to thank for that.

425
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:05,680
Joaquin Torres and our own
Captain America, Sam Wilson.

426
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,570
What we do next
with this discovery

427
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,480
will determine
how history judges us.

428
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,490
If we ratify this treaty,

429
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,630
together we can produce
enough adamantium

430
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:32,670
to fairly and equitably
distribute it
around the world.

431
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,660
Sir, you need to sit down.

432
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:43,440
Isaiah! What are you doing?

433
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,560
Sam!

434
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:00,560
-Sir, are you hit?
-No.

435
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,480
Go, go, go!

436
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,680
Mr. President, come with me.

437
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:57,650
Shit.

438
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,560
Isaiah!

439
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:32,650
-Get on the ground now!
-Do not move.

440
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,680
What's happening?

441
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,520
I don't know.
But you gotta stop.

442
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,640
- Stop!
- Don't!

443
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,650
I can't go back inside, Sam.

444
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:56,530
Run, and it'll be
worse than that.

445
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:02,440
Please, Isaiah.

446
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,550
Hey, take it easy!

447
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,670
Watch my suit.

448
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,450
Please, watch my suit.

449
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,590
Cap, I can't let you in.

450
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:42,490
Hey!

451
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,580
Sam!

452
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,470
Sir, you can't-- you can't--

453
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:47,660
Sir!

454
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,590
- Sorry, Mr. President.
- Hey, hey, hey.

455
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:51,660
He stays.

456
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,550
Everybody else, out.

457
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,640
Agent Taylor, you too.

458
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,590
Are you okay?

459
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,500
I should be asking
you that, sir.

460
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:13,680
Not my first time
being shot at.

461
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:15,560
Look, I know how
this must look, but...

462
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,650
Can we have a minute?

463
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:22,610
She stays.

464
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:28,470
Meet Ruth Bat-Seraph,
my security advisor.

465
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,500
Sir, there's no way
Isaiah could have done this.

466
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,450
-Except he did.
-Maybe somebody got to him.

467
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,530
You're really defending a man

468
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,590
who just tried to kill
the President in front...

469
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:41,590
-We don't know what happened.
-Enough.

470
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:44,600
What do we know?

471
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:45,680
There were five shooters.

472
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,640
Isaiah was one of them.

473
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,680
As was Secret Service
and active military.

474
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:52,590
This was a coordinated
terrorist attack, sir.

475
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,580
What else do you have?

476
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,540
The song
that preceded the shooting,

477
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,480
we think it was a cue
for the attack.

478
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,450
Sir, Isaiah looked like
he wasn't in control.

479
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,620
He had no idea where he was.

480
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,580
So you're suggesting what?

481
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,650
Let me investigate.

482
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,490
Don't you think you're
a little too close to this?

483
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,520
Sir, your inner circle
has been compromised.

484
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,560
There's possibility
of another attack now.

485
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,450
And what exactly
do you have to offer

486
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:21,670
that our entire intelligence
and defense apparatus can't?

487
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,580
Well, I won't sit around
and let Isaiah...

488
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,490
Look, I know how important
Bradley is to you.

489
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,470
But consider the optics.

490
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:33,660
Captain America conducts
a personal investigation

491
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,600
of a friend who tried
to assassinate the President.

492
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,610
Isaiah sacrificed everything
for this country.

493
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,680
He's a soldier. A patriot.

494
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,550
He had no reason to do this.

495
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:46,520
He had every reason.

496
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,610
Bradley was in prison
for rescuing his own men,

497
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:51,480
experimented on for 30 years.

498
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,650
The things done to him are
enough to make anyone snap.

499
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:56,590
Sir, you invited me here
to work together.

500
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:59,560
-So let's work together.
-I'm afraid that offer expired

501
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,530
when your friend tried
to kill me.

502
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:10,570
Sam, you shouldn't even be
in these situations.

503
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,460
You're not Steve Rogers.

504
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,650
Ruth,

505
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:20,530
you have my full authority
to put this thing to bed.

506
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,660
Before this treaty
gets compromised any further.

507
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,560
So that's it?

508
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,640
I'm done?

509
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,600
You're done.

510
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,620
This is bullshit,
and you know it.

511
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,480
This is politics.

512
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,660
So you better wise up, son.

513
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:42,660
"Son." Who you calling "son"?

514
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,650
Sam. What the hell
are you doing?

515
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:46,460
I'm going to clear Isaiah.

516
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,620
Storming in there
ain't gonna help him.

517
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,630
-You need Ross on your side.
-Ross?

518
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:51,590
Open your eyes.

519
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:53,480
I offer to help,
and he sends me packin'.

520
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,680
Ross is on his own side.
He always has been.

521
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:58,460
Either you can't see that,
or you don't want to.

522
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,440
Hey.

523
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,480
Don't be that guy.

524
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,670
And what guy is that?

525
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,590
The one who has to do it
the hard way.

526
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:12,610
Looks like I am that guy.

527
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,450
The nation remains
on high alert.

528
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:41,490
The Justice Department has
signaled a death penalty case

529
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,680
will be pursued
against Isaiah Bradley.

530
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:45,630
Just five minutes, Cap.

531
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,670
I could be court-martialed
for this.

532
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,490
I appreciate it, Payumo.

533
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,520
Yes, sir.

534
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:21,550
How you holdin' up?

535
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,470
Not so good, brother Sam.

536
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:26,530
Isaiah.

537
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,550
Look me in the eye.

538
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:30,630
Tell me you didn't
conspire to kill Ross.

539
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:31,670
Of course I didn't.

540
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,460
What in the world happened

541
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,610
to make you shoot
at the President?

542
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:35,630
I don't know.

543
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:37,630
You gotta give me more
than "I don't know."

544
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,540
Is there anything
you remember?

545
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,550
I got a haircut,

546
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:44,640
picked my suit up at
the cleaners and came to you.

547
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,480
We rode in the limo,

548
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:51,540
took our photo.

549
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,680
But my phone was on the fritz.

550
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:58,610
And then, we went over
to the East Room.

551
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:01,630
One moment I'm sittin' there,

552
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,650
the next I'm standin'
in that park.

553
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:08,550
I should have stayed
in my damn house,

554
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,680
minded my business.

555
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,440
No, this isn't on you.

556
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,590
Someone's behind all this.

557
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:16,610
Sam, the last thing I want
is for this to touch you.

558
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,650
Besides...

559
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:33,680
Look, there ain't no escapin'
for me this time.

560
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,610
I'm gonna die in here.

561
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:39,560
No, you're not.

562
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,640
I'm gonna get you out.

563
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,600
- You wanna help me?
- Of course.

564
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,480
Don't come back.

565
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,520
Guard.

566
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:17,680
Sergeant Payumo, get me
a copy of that conversation.

567
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:20,540
I wanna take another look.

568
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,570
Yes, ma'am.

569
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:23,580
And good work with Wilson.

570
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,440
Let me know
if he pays another visit.

571
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,460
Roger that.

572
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,520
You get in?

573
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,550
I think I committed
treason and espionage,

574
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:36,630
but I made it into
the White House's CCTV system.

575
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:38,480
What am I lookin' for?

576
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,450
When Isaiah went off
in the White House,

577
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:41,680
it made me think
of a friend of mine.

578
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:44,490
He was being controlled
by trigger words.

579
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,550
Do you see any strangers
talkin' to Isaiah?

580
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:49,500
No, well,
we got there, took a picture,

581
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:51,530
I AirDropped it to him,
but nothin' crazy.

582
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,590
Yeah, but he said his phone
was on the fritz.

583
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:54,630
Ah. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

584
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:56,450
Sam, I think I got something.

585
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:58,620
What is it?

586
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,450
His phone is like
flashing at him.

587
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,470
Oh, shit, I got
the same thing happening

588
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:06,570
to one of the other shooters.

589
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,520
What the hell?

590
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:37,660
Warden Cooper, Ross here.

591
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,620
The prisoner, he's secure?

592
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,650
I can confirm the prisoner
is in his cell.

593
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,560
Do we have eyes
on the bastard?

594
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,570
Personally.

595
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,520
I'm looking at him
right now, sir.

596
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,570
Thank you, Cooper.

597
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:51,680
Thank you, Mr. President.

598
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,570
I keep goin' back to Mexico.

599
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,620
We were at the White House

600
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,460
because the buyer
never showed.

601
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:07,620
Why hire SERPENT if you have
no intention on collecting?

602
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,610
Maybe they were expecting
Captain America to come.

603
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,680
What if the buyer wanted
Captain America to come?

604
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:13,620
And what if they wanted us
at the White House?

605
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,470
But how would
the buyer predict

606
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:18,650
that we'd get the invite, or
that you would invite Isaiah?

607
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,660
The buyer must be
watching us somehow.

608
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,650
Another thing.

609
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:26,560
Ruth Bat-Seraph,
Ross's security advisor,

610
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,660
find out what you can
about her.

611
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,460
Copy that.

612
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,550
I'll call you back later.

613
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:04,450
Target eliminated.

614
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,590
Stand by for proof of death.

615
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,500
Hmm.

616
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,630
No way you came
all the way from Mexico

617
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:35,500
just to blow up my car.

618
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:37,530
So you must have made up
with the buyer.

619
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,520
Get him on the phone.

620
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,450
Let me see
if I can resolve this.

621
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,480
"Resolve this"?

622
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:47,680
The buyer told me everything.

623
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:52,570
He mentioned that if you
survived the grenade,

624
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:58,550
there was a 77% chance
you'd try to talk me down.

625
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,440
Hmm.

626
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,500
Look at that.

627
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,660
The buyer told me
a lot actually.

628
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,650
After he didn't show
in Mexico,

629
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:40,580
he agreed to pay me double
to take you out.

630
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:45,500
What he doesn't know is that
I would kill you for free.

631
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:50,550
How often do you get a chance
to kill Captain America?

632
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,530
You're desperate
without your gear.

633
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,530
Nope.

634
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,640
Just a little meaner.

635
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,500
Hello.

636
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:23,650
Well done, Captain.

637
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:26,540
But you're not going to like
what's coming next.

638
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,600
Who is this?

639
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:38,520
How can we trust you to lead

640
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:41,590
when you can't even keep
your own house in order?

641
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:45,490
We have the shooters
in custody.

642
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,460
All I'm asking for
is patience.

643
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,620
Patience?

644
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,540
From the Hulk Hunter?

645
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,540
That was a long time ago.

646
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,520
Well, Mr. President,

647
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:59,670
I was almost killed
in your home yesterday.

648
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,560
And today, you are still
locked in your bunker.

649
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:06,650
You are not in a position
to be asking for anything.

650
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,670
I agree.

651
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,610
We should continue this
conversation another time.

652
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,600
Gentlemen, wait.

653
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,670
Please.

654
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,620
This treaty is too important
to let it fall apart now.

655
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,560
We made a promise
to our people.

656
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,620
We made a promise
to the world.

657
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,530
We must prevail.

658
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,490
We'll need Japan to proceed.

659
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,500
And
Prime Minister Ozaki's absence

660
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:33,610
speaks volumes.

661
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,660
I'll get Japan back
to the table.

662
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,470
Ozaki and I go back
a long way.

663
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,630
He's running for re-election.

664
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:43,670
He needs to assert leadership
on this treaty.

665
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:48,550
All right, Mr. President,
we'll remain patient

666
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:51,500
while you try
to get Japan on board.

667
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,470
But if you don't,

668
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:56,590
we'll have to take
measures into our own hands.

669
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:03,500
I've gotta get out of here.

670
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:04,500
Sit down.

671
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:05,630
Sir, the sweep's not complete.

672
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,560
The longer I stay here,

673
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:10,630
the weaker I look.

674
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:22,500
The hell happened to you?

675
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,650
Sidewinder tracked me down.

676
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:28,470
Well, it looks like
he did a lot more than that.

677
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,650
He's in police custody now.

678
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:35,570
-Shit, you good?
-I will be.

679
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:37,550
Last call, trace it.

680
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,620
All right.

681
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,450
Yo, get this.

682
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,540
Ross' advisor,
Ruth Bat-Seraph,

683
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:52,590
she was born in Israel
and trained in the Red Room.

684
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:53,600
She's ex-Widow.

685
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,640
That basically means
stay the hell out of her way.

686
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:56,640
Trust me.

687
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,680
Yep.

688
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,450
Now, this is weird.

689
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:09,550
Isaiah had Ross
in his crosshairs.

690
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,490
Couldn't miss.

691
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,500
I don't get it.

692
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,610
Why go through all that
trouble just to not kill Ross?

693
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:16,480
I don't know.

694
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,460
Oh, shit.

695
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,540
I think I located
Sidewinder's last caller.

696
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,610
It's in the middle of nowhere,
West Virginia.

697
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:25,520
It's just, like,
near some forest.

698
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,530
Database only shows one name.

699
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:29,440
Camp Echo One.

700
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:31,680
No satellite imagery.

701
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,530
Away from air traffic.

702
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,610
No infrastructure in the area.

703
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:39,600
-Do you think it's military?
-Yep.

704
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,670
It's a place they send you
and you never leave.

705
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,600
Ross told me stay out of this.

706
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,600
Eh, he's just the President
of the United States.

707
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,640
You don't have to come
with me.

708
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,470
Duh, I know.
That's what makes it so noble.

709
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,560
Pack as much gear
as you can carry.

710
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:19,480
I don't know
when we'll be back.

711
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,630
What, you mean like,
"right now" right now?

712
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:24,440
Yeah.

713
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,460
Oh, shit. Okay.

714
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:28,580
Well, it's a long-ass drive
to West Virginia,

715
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,670
so we're gonna need
some snacks.

716
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,590
Why did I invite you?

717
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,460
What? Wait, wait, wait.

718
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:37,460
Wait up!

719
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,670
Ruth Bat-Seraph.

720
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,470
Isaiah Bradley's
in holding cell 14.

721
00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:43,460
-The other shooters are in 15.
-Okay.

722
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,520
Do you need an escort?

723
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:46,630
Think I'll be just fine.

724
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:48,470
-Thanks.
-Yes, ma'am.

725
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:57,600
I'd like to speak to them
one at a time.

726
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,580
Can you... Excuse me?

727
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,680
Payumo.
I'm talking to you. Hey.

728
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:05,640
Stop! Drop your weapon!

729
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:09,580
Payumo, what are you doing?

730
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:11,530
Drop it.

731
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:33,590
Increase that cadence

732
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:34,640
and resistance.

733
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:36,490
Or do whatever the hell
you need to do to get there,

734
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,520
all right?

735
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:40,640
Just stay in your lane.
Stay in your lane. Here we go.

736
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:42,540
Out to third!

737
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,540
Eye on the prize.
Eye on the target, baby.

738
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,600
- That's enough.
- Don't think about speed now.

739
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:48,520
Think about direction.
Think about intention.

740
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:51,460
If Doctor Eccles asks,

741
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:55,660
you tell her
I did the whole five miles.

742
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,450
That look.

743
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:03,660
We touch down in Tokyo
at 0600.

744
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:08,490
You still think
this is a bad idea?

745
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,610
Sir, whoever orchestrated
the attack

746
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:11,630
on the White House is still
in the wild.

747
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:13,670
International travel
brings security risks

748
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,490
we can't anticipate.

749
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:19,460
We barely got Congress
together on this thing.

750
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:22,500
If we lose
our international partners,

751
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,610
this treaty's toast.

752
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,650
I have to make this work.

753
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:30,630
Three miles and change.

754
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:32,560
I'll let Dr. Eccles know.

755
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,440
Five.

756
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:35,640
-Five.
-Five.

757
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:37,530
Do we have eyes on Wilson?

758
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:39,660
He left the base a few hours
ago with Joaquin Torres.

759
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,440
They ditched
their smartphones.

760
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:42,560
They're off-grid.

761
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:44,460
Well, I don't want a variable
out there

762
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,620
that I can't control.

763
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,480
Get a team,
pick him up, bring him in.

764
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:49,600
-Yes, sir.
-Yeah.

765
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:51,660
Breaking
news out of Washington,

766
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,630
President Ross is
on his way to Japan

767
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:55,680
just a day after surviving
an assassination attempt...

768
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:58,500
Bet you used to play this
old-ass game all the time.

769
00:45:58,530 --> 00:45:59,530
Damn it.
This is hard.

770
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:00,530
Right.

771
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:01,630
The high-stakes
diplomatic visit...

772
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:03,520
How far are we
from Camp Echo One?

773
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:06,610
...over control
of Celestial Island.

774
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:09,440
We're about, like,
an hour away.

775
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:17,500
Sam, shit. They just
shot up Isaiah's prison.

776
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:19,470
Is he okay?

777
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:20,660
Yeah, Isaiah's good,
but the others...

778
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:22,550
they're dead.

779
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:23,610
Shit.

780
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,650
Should we go back?

781
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,480
No.

782
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:30,490
We keep going.

783
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:33,490
The buyer is pretty smart,
but we're not taking the bait.

784
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,530
Only way to help Isaiah is to
figure out who's behind this.

785
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:37,660
And whoever is behind it,

786
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:40,560
they do not want
us getting closer.

787
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:47,470
Cooper.

788
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,600
What's happening?

789
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:51,560
Mr. President,
as a precautionary measure,

790
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:53,450
I have moved the prisoner to--

791
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:59,480
President Ross,
I miss our little visits.

792
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:00,650
Tell me something.

793
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:03,500
Do you ever stop
to ask yourself

794
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:04,660
who's playing the music?

795
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,480
It's you.

796
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,530
The White House,

797
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:09,650
the assassination attempt.

798
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:11,650
That's a way of putting it.

799
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:14,680
I helped you more
than anyone else.

800
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:16,590
Only to get what you want.

801
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:17,610
What do you want?

802
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:21,540
I wanted my life back, but
it's too late for that now.

803
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,600
You've gotta--

804
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:24,620
You gotta understand
my position.

805
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,590
-I...
-Oh, I do.

806
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:30,520
You let me rot in this prison.

807
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:32,630
And it was my curse
to watch your betrayal

808
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:34,600
written in probabilities.

809
00:47:35,610 --> 00:47:38,570
I'm making my own choices now.

810
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:41,440
So many surprises left.

811
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,460
When I'm done,

812
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,470
everyone will know
just who you are,

813
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:48,490
and Betty will despise you
even more.

814
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:50,550
Goodbye, Mr. President.

815
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:55,530
The hell is going on?

816
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:57,570
I'm putting you in solitary.

817
00:47:57,590 --> 00:47:58,590
Yeah.

818
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,560
Nobody's gonna put me
in solitary ever again.

819
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:02,660
It's for your protection.

820
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:06,620
I'll tell you this one more
time for your protection,

821
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,550
I ain't goin'
in a box ever again.

822
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:12,630
I won't be able to
guarantee your safety.

823
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:14,640
Safety ain't all
it's cracked up to be.

824
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,460
You still think

825
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:18,590
I had somethin'
to do with all of this?

826
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:20,570
I don't know.

827
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,600
Mr. President.

828
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:29,570
I need you
to drop whatever you're doin'.

829
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:31,490
Camp Echo One's
been compromised.

830
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:33,440
Yes, Mr. President.

831
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:01,660
This is it.

832
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:03,650
Camp Echo One.

833
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:08,540
Telescopes must be a facade.

834
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,440
We gotta see
what's underneath.

835
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:15,660
We've got cameras and guards.

836
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,500
Redwing, cut the fence
and go loop the feed.

837
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:26,660
Yeah, we got a 28-second
window to get past the guards.

838
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,610
We gotta do the door manually.

839
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:32,650
Three, two, one,

840
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:34,490
go.

841
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:48,670
15 seconds.

842
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,590
I'm trying, man!

843
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:52,580
Shit!

844
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,620
There's no prisoners in here.

845
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:32,620
Why is there a lab
in this prison?

846
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:42,520
What the hell is this place?

847
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:56,570
What the hell?

848
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:04,580
Ozaki-san,

849
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,460
I want to assure you

850
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,520
America remains committed
to sharing our adamantium

851
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:11,490
with the rest of the world.

852
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,600
I trust Japan shares
that commitment.

853
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,460
The world needs this treaty.

854
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:22,550
Diplomacy must be hard
for you

855
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:24,640
A man in a country

856
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:27,530
so used to taking
whatever he wants by force.

857
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,550
Excuse me?

858
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:31,670
How else to explain your theft
of our adamantium,

859
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:35,460
only to return it to us
in Washington.

860
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:38,590
What you're accusing us of
is baseless

861
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:40,630
and insulting.

862
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:44,560
So, the information
my intelligence team received

863
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:45,680
and verified

864
00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:47,630
is incorrect?

865
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:54,460
Wh--

866
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,480
I'm a fool.

867
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,650
I'm a fool to negotiate
with someone so naive

868
00:54:06,670 --> 00:54:09,530
they don't realize
they're being played.

869
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:11,490
Naive?

870
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,540
If I'd stolen the sample,

871
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:18,630
why would I order Captain
America to retrieve it?

872
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:21,580
I suppose
we'll never know the truth.

873
00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:30,620
Whatever game you're playing,
Japan wants no part in it.

874
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:33,490
Don't test us, Mr. President.

875
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,640
He's got optogenetic data
on a lot of people.

876
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,550
Don't make me look up words,
Joaquin.

877
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:47,490
I think he's figured out a way
to plant commands

878
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,520
into people's subconscious

879
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:50,440
using flashes of light.

880
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:53,470
This "Mr. Blue" song seems
to be some kind of trigger.

881
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:54,530
Mind control.

882
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:56,450
Yeah.

883
00:54:56,470 --> 00:54:57,630
That explains Isaiah.

884
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:05,640
And that's more important.

885
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:07,530
Take risks.

886
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,520
Use those incredible brains
of yours.

887
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,560
Wasn't
half bad-looking, was I?

888
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:20,520
Samuel Sterns.

889
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:26,460
You know, it takes
an awful lot to surprise me.

890
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:31,590
There was an 89% chance
you'd turn around

891
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:33,670
if I put Isaiah Bradley
at risk,

892
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:36,620
yet here you stand.

893
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:39,530
You're the buyer.

894
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:40,550
Indeed.

895
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:43,450
Hiring SERPENT was
a necessary step

896
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:46,490
to create a chain
of statistical certainties.

897
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,470
Maybe you're not as smart
as you think you are.

898
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:51,470
I am, actually.

899
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:54,440
My mind sees it all,
every probable outcome.

900
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:57,640
So you hire SERPENT
to steal the adamantium,

901
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:00,490
shoot up Ross' summit
announcing it

902
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,540
and now you're just
sitting here, waiting.

903
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:05,450
Why do you wanna kill Ross?

904
00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:09,440
Why does everyone think that
I wanna kill Ross?

905
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:13,570
Is it because he imprisoned me
here without a trial

906
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:16,530
after an infusion of gamma
warped the structure

907
00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:17,550
of my brain?

908
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:23,500
Damn.

909
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:26,460
Once Ross discovered
how useful I could be,

910
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,490
he kept me here for 16 years,

911
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,460
turning my mind
to solving his problems.

912
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:35,680
My solutions brought him the
highest office in the country.

913
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:40,670
If I wanted Ross dead,
he'd be dead.

914
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,440
Well, whatever you're doing,

915
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:46,540
you're hurting a lot of
people, including my friend.

916
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:49,490
So this is the last chance
I'm gonna give you to stop it.

917
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,480
Why are you protecting him?

918
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:54,520
Ross knows I'm responsible
for the White House,

919
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:57,500
yet he's still letting Isaiah
sit in prison for it.

920
00:56:57,530 --> 00:56:58,620
You know he'll never change.

921
00:56:59,530 --> 00:57:00,570
Let me finish my work.

922
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:02,450
I'm afraid I can't do that.

923
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:10,530
Please don't be boring!

924
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:19,550
You think they'll stop us?

925
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:20,660
For long enough.

926
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,600
You're a fascinating problem.

927
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:25,670
But soon
you'll be off the board,

928
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:27,680
so you don't
surprise me again.

929
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:31,540
This is messed up, man.
It's not even their choice.

930
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,480
I know.
Just try and neutralize.

931
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:41,650
Punk-ass.

932
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,530
Stand down!

933
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:02,660
I'm taking them in.

934
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,650
I'll deal with these two.

935
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:08,620
Okay.

936
00:59:33,590 --> 00:59:35,490
What the hell
are you guys doing here?

937
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,520
Well, that's what
I should be asking you.

938
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:38,640
Where's Sterns?

939
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:42,620
If Sterns is in the wind,
we need to set a perimeter,

940
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,490
roadblocks, air support.

941
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,610
He can't have gone far.

942
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:46,680
Why are you helping us?

943
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,640
'Cause you were right.
I thought that was obvious.

944
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:51,630
- Freeze!
- Oh. It's okay.

945
00:59:51,650 --> 00:59:54,450
We have orders to take
Captain America into custody.

946
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:55,660
You already have one
Captain America in custody.

947
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,470
You want another?

948
00:59:57,490 --> 00:59:58,600
You're under arrest
for trespassing

949
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:00,550
on restricted
government property.

950
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:03,480
Being right
always go like this?

951
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:04,560
Most of the time.

952
01:00:07,450 --> 01:00:09,520
I have the clearances.
It's been a long day.

953
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:11,650
She's ex-Widow.
Just zap the guy.

954
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:14,470
These orders come
from the President himself.

955
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:15,580
Get them out of here.

956
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:16,670
Then we'll just call him.

957
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:20,570
Ruth, uncuff us now!

958
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:24,620
Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit.
Not again.

959
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,630
- Run!
- Go, go, go. Come on.

960
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:35,610
Go!

961
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:41,600
Mr. President,

962
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:44,450
Japan's claim
seems to be true.

963
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:46,660
We're trying to determine
the point of the breach.

964
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,650
Sir, we have to tell
Ozaki's team something.

965
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:51,480
We've got to stop
the bleeding.

966
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:52,610
I need some time alone.

967
01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:54,460
We don't have much time, sir.

968
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:57,460
Ozaki just decided to advance
his navy on Celestial Island.

969
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,610
He intends to secure
the adamantium for himself.

970
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:00,630
Jesus.

971
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:02,640
France and India are drawing
up occupation strategies...

972
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:05,450
Mr. President, I suggest that
we return to DC immediately.

973
01:01:05,470 --> 01:01:06,500
-No, I disagree.
-Immediately.

974
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:07,640
We are going to lose
our opportunity with Ozaki.

975
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:09,600
We need to regroup and figure
out a different solution.

976
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:11,540
We can't do that.
No, absolutely not!

977
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:12,570
We need to ask
for another meeting, sir.

978
01:01:12,590 --> 01:01:13,560
If we call on Ozaki now,

979
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:15,590
and try to reach out to him,
we can...

980
01:01:15,610 --> 01:01:17,490
We're not gonna miss
the opportunity.

981
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:18,680
We have to have
another meeting!

982
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:37,550
I want Carrier Strike Group
Five deployed immediately.

983
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:39,440
Tell 'em
I'm on my way there now.

984
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:41,620
Sir, are we seriously
talking about taking control

985
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:42,650
of Japan's adamantium?

986
01:01:42,670 --> 01:01:45,600
I'm not going home
empty-handed.

987
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:49,480
If only one country is going
to control adamantium,

988
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,670
it's going to be us.

989
01:01:55,650 --> 01:01:57,610
Make the call!

990
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:01,610
Taylor!

991
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:02,650
The President has informed me

992
01:02:02,670 --> 01:02:04,480
that we need to move
Strike Group Five

993
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:05,640
to Celestial Island
immediately.

994
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:09,650
I want to be en route to the
Indian Ocean within the hour.

995
01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:13,560
Mr. President,
this is extremely dangerous.

996
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:15,580
If a war breaks out...

997
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,490
I was a wartime general.

998
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:20,530
Now I'm a wartime president.

999
01:02:23,530 --> 01:02:24,670
Yes, sir, Mr. President.

1000
01:02:49,490 --> 01:02:50,530
What are we doing here?

1001
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:52,640
You say Ross' orders was
to take us into custody

1002
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:54,600
so I called in a favor.

1003
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:56,590
Thanks for doing this.

1004
01:02:56,610 --> 01:02:59,530
No problem, Cap. Brass never
makes it down here.

1005
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:01,440
Terminal's set up,
ready to go.

1006
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:04,440
You sure you can knock out
Sterns' mind control?

1007
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:05,540
I should be able
to run a program

1008
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:06,610
that blocks the light signals

1009
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:09,520
that Sterns has been
sending out to control people.

1010
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:11,560
What if
he's already gotten someone?

1011
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:13,590
That's a good point.

1012
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:18,680
Are you crazy?

1013
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:27,590
We're clear here, at least.

1014
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:29,490
You have anybody
that you trust

1015
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,530
that can take a look at these
and tell me what's in 'em?

1016
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:32,650
Sure, I got someone.

1017
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:34,440
I'll get on it.

1018
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:36,470
-Thanks. Our guy here?
-Through there.

1019
01:03:37,470 --> 01:03:38,470
Listen in.

1020
01:03:42,490 --> 01:03:44,610
I'm amazed
you're still standing. Hmm.

1021
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:47,640
Most men don't survive
an axe to the gut.

1022
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:49,540
Kevlar weave, I presume?

1023
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:50,610
Perks of the job.

1024
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:54,520
You said you were gonna find
the man who wasted your time.

1025
01:03:54,650 --> 01:03:56,450
I wanna know what you learned.

1026
01:03:56,470 --> 01:03:57,530
Samuel Sterns.

1027
01:03:57,550 --> 01:03:59,540
Gruesome fella,
don't you think?

1028
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:01,440
I've seen worse.

1029
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:02,530
Not without your Avengers.

1030
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:05,680
Full immunity and I'll talk.

1031
01:04:06,450 --> 01:04:07,500
You're crazy.

1032
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:08,530
Who you kiddin'?

1033
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:10,450
You're here because
you're all out of options.

1034
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:11,650
You heard
what he did to those shooters.

1035
01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:14,620
A guy like Sterns doesn't like
loose ends alive.

1036
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:19,640
Reduced sentence,
Allenwood, my own cell.

1037
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,480
Lemme hear what you got first.

1038
01:04:24,670 --> 01:04:27,630
You know, it was my old unit
that found Sterns

1039
01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:28,660
in the wreckage of Harlem.

1040
01:04:29,630 --> 01:04:32,470
They said he'd been infected
with Bruce Banner's blood,

1041
01:04:32,490 --> 01:04:33,660
but it didn't
give him strength.

1042
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:34,660
What did it give him?

1043
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:38,450
A mind capable
of impossible calculations.

1044
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:40,620
Ross being Ross,

1045
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,470
he saw an opportunity.

1046
01:04:42,610 --> 01:04:45,590
Instead of removing the gamma
from Sterns' blood,

1047
01:04:45,610 --> 01:04:47,660
he upped the dose.

1048
01:04:48,610 --> 01:04:51,600
Made Sterns his own
personal think tank,

1049
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,520
creating technology
and weapons for the state.

1050
01:04:55,650 --> 01:04:57,600
Holy shit.

1051
01:04:57,620 --> 01:04:59,640
Why did Sterns
go along with it?

1052
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:02,560
Camp Echo One was the stick.

1053
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:05,520
I imagine
a pardon was the carrot.

1054
01:05:07,550 --> 01:05:11,560
Ross told Sterns he'd let him
go once he became president.

1055
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:13,680
And yet, here we are.

1056
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:19,620
So Sterns hired you
to steal Japan's adamantium

1057
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:21,660
knowing it would divide
the two countries.

1058
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,680
He paid us
through a CIA black fund.

1059
01:05:27,450 --> 01:05:29,610
That could kill the treaty
and start a war.

1060
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,570
And Ross would be blamed
for the chaos.

1061
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:35,540
How do you think a man
with Ross' temperament

1062
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:38,580
will deal with being caught
in a trap?

1063
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:43,530
If you break out of Allenwood,
I'll find you.

1064
01:05:43,550 --> 01:05:46,520
When I break out, Captain,

1065
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:48,600
you won't walk away alive.

1066
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:51,680
-Did you know?
-Of course not.

1067
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:54,470
But Ross is not
that man anymore.

1068
01:05:54,490 --> 01:05:56,560
None of us have to be
defined by our past.

1069
01:05:56,580 --> 01:05:59,490
Cap, my guy needs 24 hours
on the pills.

1070
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:00,580
Okay. We need to get to DC

1071
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:02,560
and tell Ross
what Sterns is planning.

1072
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:03,660
President Ross isn't in DC.

1073
01:06:04,550 --> 01:06:05,670
He's on the USS Milius.

1074
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:07,630
They just moved
into the Indian Ocean.

1075
01:06:07,650 --> 01:06:09,640
Japan's warships are also
in proximity.

1076
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:12,480
Shit. Suit up.
We need to move.

1077
01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:20,450
May I help you?

1078
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:21,520
Hello, Admiral.

1079
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:23,470
May I use your phone?

1080
01:06:23,490 --> 01:06:25,450
Hey, honey.
Who's at the door?

1081
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:31,500
Holy shit.

1082
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:32,670
You ever see
anything like this?

1083
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:34,500
No, I haven't.

1084
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:03,480
Let me do the talking
or he'll never listen.

1085
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:05,550
I haven't seen Ross like this
since the army.

1086
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:06,590
He better snap out of it.

1087
01:07:06,610 --> 01:07:09,600
Because whatever Sterns is
planning, it's happening soon.

1088
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:13,640
I want a fleet of F-18s
ready to catapult.

1089
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:16,440
If they turn that ship around,
I want...

1090
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:19,440
What's he doing here?

1091
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:21,440
I told you not
to get involved, Wilson.

1092
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:22,520
I brought him, sir.

1093
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:23,540
I want him outta here!

1094
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:25,590
Sir, you asked me
to run this investigation,

1095
01:07:25,610 --> 01:07:28,590
-and the situation is--
-Don't bother with excuses.

1096
01:07:28,610 --> 01:07:31,450
You had a simple job
and you failed.

1097
01:07:31,470 --> 01:07:32,470
Mr. President,

1098
01:07:33,490 --> 01:07:35,600
we've uncovered intel
at Camp Echo One

1099
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:38,500
that could put millions
of lives at risk.

1100
01:07:38,530 --> 01:07:40,540
Now, you and I both know
Isaiah's innocent.

1101
01:07:41,610 --> 01:07:44,480
I'm happy to have
this conversation in public,

1102
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:45,500
if you like.

1103
01:07:52,630 --> 01:07:55,480
This is crazy.
Japan's supposed to be our--

1104
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:57,550
Jackal?

1105
01:07:57,570 --> 01:07:58,620
Jackal, do you copy?

1106
01:08:04,550 --> 01:08:05,650
Make it quick, Wilson.

1107
01:08:07,590 --> 01:08:09,580
I've got Japan's fleet
on my ass

1108
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,580
trying to make it to
that island before we do.

1109
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:13,440
That's exactly what he wants.

1110
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:16,440
Sterns has been pulling
the strings on everything.

1111
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:17,670
SERPENT's theft
of the adamantium,

1112
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:19,570
the attack on the White House.

1113
01:08:19,590 --> 01:08:21,520
The CIA leak to Japan.

1114
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:24,530
He's pitting you and Japan
against each other

1115
01:08:24,550 --> 01:08:26,530
to ensure that
this moment happens.

1116
01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:28,580
How the hell did he do
all that from prison?

1117
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:31,610
Mind control.
He created a technology

1118
01:08:31,630 --> 01:08:33,520
that allowed him
to control the minds

1119
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:34,650
of anyone he targeted.

1120
01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:36,640
Including maybe you, sir.

1121
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:44,640
Have you been feelin'
like yourself lately?

1122
01:08:51,490 --> 01:08:52,620
Of course I have.

1123
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,630
But he has
your data, sir. Why?

1124
01:08:54,650 --> 01:08:55,660
I don't know.

1125
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:00,480
If he can control minds,
surely he can hack files.

1126
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:03,520
The logs show that you visited
Camp Echo One numerous times.

1127
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:07,650
To ensure a high-value
prisoner was secure.

1128
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:09,490
Yeah, but the scans, the EKG,

1129
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,470
the blood work
was all taken there, sir.

1130
01:09:11,490 --> 01:09:12,500
This is ridiculous.

1131
01:09:12,530 --> 01:09:14,440
Mr. President,
answer the question.

1132
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:16,480
I don't have to answer you!

1133
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:17,540
Why visit a Black Site,

1134
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:19,490
-in the middle of nowhere...
-Wilson, stop!

1135
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,570
I order you to stop!

1136
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:22,470
-...to conduct these tests?
-I order you to stop!

1137
01:09:22,490 --> 01:09:24,560
-Why?
-Because I was dying,

1138
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:25,620
goddamn it!

1139
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:32,680
Because my heart was failing!

1140
01:09:34,650 --> 01:09:37,460
No one could figure it out
until he did.

1141
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:45,470
These things
have kept me alive.

1142
01:09:46,530 --> 01:09:49,470
And in return, I gave him hope

1143
01:09:49,490 --> 01:09:51,460
that he might get
his life back.

1144
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:55,580
He got a lab to do the work.

1145
01:09:56,540 --> 01:09:58,550
I even tried
to get him moved but--

1146
01:09:58,570 --> 01:10:00,490
But you couldn't risk
losing the pills.

1147
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:08,660
After your friend the Hulk
and the Abomination

1148
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:12,650
destroyed Harlem,
someone had to take the fall.

1149
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:14,600
Sterns was just...

1150
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:17,530
collateral damage.

1151
01:10:20,670 --> 01:10:23,540
I have dedicated
my entire life

1152
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:26,470
to serving this country.

1153
01:10:30,470 --> 01:10:32,470
The one person that matters...

1154
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:35,650
doesn't seem to understand.

1155
01:10:36,670 --> 01:10:43,540
Betty never forgave me for
sending the army after Banner.

1156
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:48,450
I had to survive...

1157
01:10:52,670 --> 01:10:55,550
...so that my daughter knew

1158
01:10:55,570 --> 01:10:57,660
that there was more
to her father.

1159
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:00,670
That I'm the same man
that used to take her

1160
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:02,610
to see the cherry blossoms.

1161
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:06,550
She still can, sir.

1162
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:10,560
I know what it's like...

1163
01:11:12,650 --> 01:11:15,440
to feel you have
somethin' to prove.

1164
01:11:16,580 --> 01:11:18,590
Everyone only seeing
one thing.

1165
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:22,590
But when showing
there's more to you,

1166
01:11:23,550 --> 01:11:25,600
it's not about
when times are easy.

1167
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:28,680
It's about moments like this.

1168
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:34,460
Now, we're here
because Sterns wants revenge

1169
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:36,570
and doesn't care
if he incites a war.

1170
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:38,660
We're playing right
into his hand.

1171
01:11:39,550 --> 01:11:41,550
Mr. President,
two of our F-18s

1172
01:11:41,570 --> 01:11:43,630
just fired
on the Japanese fleet.

1173
01:11:46,610 --> 01:11:48,610
Keep hailing those pilots.

1174
01:11:49,630 --> 01:11:52,450
Damage
to Japanese fleet minimal.

1175
01:11:52,610 --> 01:11:54,520
Ready air defense systems.

1176
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:56,540
What the hell
are those pilots doing?

1177
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:57,560
Call them back in.

1178
01:11:57,580 --> 01:11:58,580
We tried, sir.

1179
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:00,460
Jackal and Whiskey
won't respond.

1180
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,470
We gotta get our birds
in the air.

1181
01:12:02,490 --> 01:12:04,490
You have two ready
to fly now, sir.

1182
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:06,650
Go.

1183
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:23,520
Sterns got to our pilots

1184
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:24,610
before I shut down the system.

1185
01:12:25,570 --> 01:12:27,630
We need to get the Japanese
out of the air.

1186
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,500
Stay close
and don't get yourself killed.

1187
01:12:30,530 --> 01:12:31,670
No dying, copy that.

1188
01:12:38,450 --> 01:12:39,640
Return to your fleet.

1189
01:12:57,630 --> 01:12:59,660
Jackal's headed towards
the Japanese fleet.

1190
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:03,440
Shit! He just fired on them.

1191
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:06,470
Mr. President,
do not send more fighters up.

1192
01:13:06,490 --> 01:13:08,600
We need Japan to see
we're trying to deescalate.

1193
01:13:23,530 --> 01:13:25,610
Sir,
six Japanese missiles inbound.

1194
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:29,680
Launch intercept missiles.

1195
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:44,550
Damn, two got through.

1196
01:13:44,570 --> 01:13:45,670
Take the one on the right.

1197
01:13:52,540 --> 01:13:53,660
Redwing, a little help.

1198
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:16,490
Sir, you need to convince
Japan to ground their planes.

1199
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:22,440
This is what we expected

1200
01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:23,440
from a Ross presidency.

1201
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:26,640
Mr. Prime Minister, two
of our pilots have gone rogue.

1202
01:14:26,660 --> 01:14:29,470
Call off your planes.
We're being manipulated.

1203
01:14:29,490 --> 01:14:30,450
Certainly.

1204
01:14:30,590 --> 01:14:31,550
By you.

1205
01:14:31,570 --> 01:14:33,660
Hiding your assassins
behind Captain America.

1206
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:38,580
He's trying
to bring them down now, sir.

1207
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:41,600
If those pilots are not
taking orders from you,

1208
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:45,450
then who gives them
their commands?

1209
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:47,660
That's what I thought.

1210
01:14:52,590 --> 01:14:53,640
Mr. President?

1211
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:01,530
Ah,
now we're getting somewhere.

1212
01:15:01,550 --> 01:15:05,440
That fire in the belly.
The rage.

1213
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:07,460
Why don't you just let it out?

1214
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:08,560
Are you all right, sir?

1215
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:12,610
I just need a moment.

1216
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:20,550
Joaquin,
Whiskey's coming at you.

1217
01:15:20,570 --> 01:15:21,680
Copy that.

1218
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:32,520
Sam, once we're done,
you gotta teach me your moves!

1219
01:15:39,470 --> 01:15:41,490
Altitude. Altitude.

1220
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:45,650
Altitude.

1221
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:49,670
Whiskey's away.
Send rescue.

1222
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:51,550
Roger, sending rescue.

1223
01:15:51,570 --> 01:15:53,550
You have two Japanese fighters
coming up on your tail.

1224
01:15:53,570 --> 01:15:55,540
Why the hell
are they still chasing us?

1225
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:56,560
We're trying to help them.

1226
01:15:56,580 --> 01:15:59,480
Because Ross won't tell
them who's really behind this.

1227
01:16:02,610 --> 01:16:05,470
All that hatred
you try to hide,

1228
01:16:05,610 --> 01:16:09,570
all the ugliness,
it's still there, Ross,

1229
01:16:10,450 --> 01:16:12,640
smoldering behind the eyes.

1230
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:31,560
Joaquin,
I'm goin' after Jackal.

1231
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:35,550
Roger that.
I'll keep these guys busy.

1232
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,600
What have you done to me,
you bastard?

1233
01:16:42,620 --> 01:16:46,470
What we agreed on.
Maybe a hair more.

1234
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:47,630
You poisoned me!

1235
01:16:47,650 --> 01:16:49,670
Stop taking the pills then.

1236
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:52,490
But we both know you won't.

1237
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:56,500
Give me what I want.
Stop fighting it.

1238
01:16:56,530 --> 01:16:57,600
No!

1239
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:30,590
Sam, Jackal
just fired his last missiles!

1240
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:37,600
I got one.
Going after the another.

1241
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:39,660
- Back off! I'll get it!
- No, no! I got it.

1242
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:41,500
-Back off!
-I got it.

1243
01:17:44,580 --> 01:17:45,660
Joaquin!

1244
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:55,550
Joaquin's down!
I'm goin' after him.

1245
01:17:55,570 --> 01:17:56,620
We'll send search and rescue.

1246
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,560
You have to stop Jackal.

1247
01:17:58,580 --> 01:17:59,600
Damn it!

1248
01:17:59,620 --> 01:18:01,680
I'm putting an end
to this now.

1249
01:18:02,450 --> 01:18:03,670
Give in to your rage.

1250
01:18:04,630 --> 01:18:07,660
I'm taking your legacy
as we speak.

1251
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:10,550
Come on, Ross.
You're almost there.

1252
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:15,590
You can rip their fleet apart
with your bare hands,

1253
01:18:15,610 --> 01:18:17,500
and kill Captain America.

1254
01:18:22,650 --> 01:18:23,620
Oh, shit.

1255
01:18:30,550 --> 01:18:32,670
Let the monster
inside you out.

1256
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:43,560
Altitude, altitude, altitude.

1257
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:46,610
Altitude, altitude, altitude.

1258
01:18:47,490 --> 01:18:49,500
Unleash your anger.

1259
01:18:49,530 --> 01:18:51,450
Unleash your hatred.

1260
01:18:51,470 --> 01:18:52,590
Redwing, stabilize!

1261
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:00,520
Nothing can stop you, Ross.

1262
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:02,460
You can crush them all.

1263
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:18,530
Mr. President?

1264
01:19:19,650 --> 01:19:22,520
Sir. Are you okay?

1265
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:24,650
Captain America neutralized
the rogue pilots.

1266
01:19:24,670 --> 01:19:26,670
Japan's recalling
their planes.

1267
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,580
Get Ozaki back on the line.

1268
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:32,480
We can fix this.

1269
01:19:50,470 --> 01:19:51,520
Where's Joaquin?

1270
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:53,440
Med-evac just got to him.

1271
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:54,550
Thank God.

1272
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:04,600
A crisis was narrowly avoided

1273
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:06,530
when a brief dogfight
broke out

1274
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:08,580
between Japanese
and US military forces

1275
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:10,560
over Celestial Island.

1276
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:12,570
US Air Force Lieutenant
Joaquin Torres

1277
01:20:12,590 --> 01:20:14,570
was shot down
during the skirmish,

1278
01:20:14,590 --> 01:20:15,640
and is now in surgery at

1279
01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:18,560
Walter Reed National Military
Medical Center.

1280
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:20,580
His condition is critical.

1281
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:21,650
Here, give me that clamp.

1282
01:20:21,670 --> 01:20:23,460
Gonna need to pack this!

1283
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:24,600
The pressure's stable.

1284
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:26,440
Suction!

1285
01:20:27,550 --> 01:20:29,520
I can't see anything.
More suction.

1286
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:31,480
Retractors.

1287
01:20:36,450 --> 01:20:37,590
It's a private room.

1288
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:40,680
Go away.

1289
01:20:47,470 --> 01:20:48,480
I missed you, too.

1290
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:59,600
I hate to admit it,
I'm glad you're here.

1291
01:21:06,630 --> 01:21:09,440
You looked good out there
on that six o'clock.

1292
01:21:09,650 --> 01:21:11,520
But then I saw this.

1293
01:21:12,570 --> 01:21:14,620
The doctors had to
restart his heart.

1294
01:21:16,630 --> 01:21:18,440
They don't know if...

1295
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:22,550
This isn't your fault.

1296
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:25,570
It makes me think of Steve.

1297
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:29,670
How many alien invasions
did he stop again?

1298
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:31,490
Two.

1299
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:32,500
Two.

1300
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:35,480
Wow.

1301
01:21:37,570 --> 01:21:39,660
What made me think
I could follow that?

1302
01:21:42,670 --> 01:21:47,480
I should've took the serum.
Like Steve, like you.

1303
01:21:48,650 --> 01:21:49,650
Why?

1304
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:56,550
Because this is all startin'
to seem much bigger than me.

1305
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:03,480
Ross, he asked me
to restart the Avengers, Buck.

1306
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:05,440
But Joaquin's in here,

1307
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:08,460
Isaiah's in prison,
and Sterns...

1308
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:13,500
I had him. I had Sterns
right in my hands.

1309
01:22:14,540 --> 01:22:15,600
And he got away.

1310
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:18,580
He damn near pushed us
to the brink of war,

1311
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,440
because I wasn't...

1312
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:23,680
Say what you need to say.

1313
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:31,590
Steve made a mistake.

1314
01:22:32,660 --> 01:22:34,490
No, he didn't.

1315
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:36,470
He gave you that shield

1316
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:39,440
not because
you're the strongest,

1317
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:40,540
but because you're you.

1318
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:46,580
You think
if you had that serum

1319
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:49,450
you'd be able to protect
all the people you care about.

1320
01:22:49,590 --> 01:22:52,440
Steve had it, and he couldn't.

1321
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:55,580
You're a human being,
and you're doing your best.

1322
01:22:56,650 --> 01:22:58,600
Steve gave people
something to believe in.

1323
01:22:58,620 --> 01:22:59,620
But you...

1324
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:03,440
you give 'em
something to aspire to.

1325
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:08,640
Did your speechwriters
help you with that?

1326
01:23:08,660 --> 01:23:10,550
They did, yeah.
The ending, a little bit.

1327
01:23:10,570 --> 01:23:11,550
Well, did you like it?

1328
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:13,600
No, no, it was good.
Solid B-plus.

1329
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:15,680
-Emotional.
-Yeah, very. I felt it.

1330
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:17,480
But just enough.

1331
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:18,470
Yeah.

1332
01:23:19,610 --> 01:23:21,640
Listen, I gotta catch a plane.

1333
01:23:21,660 --> 01:23:24,570
I have a campaign fundraiser.
It's so stupid.

1334
01:23:29,490 --> 01:23:31,440
It's gonna be all right, man.

1335
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:38,520
Thanks, Buck.

1336
01:23:39,580 --> 01:23:41,480
I love you, buddy.

1337
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:52,500
-Was that...
-Yep.

1338
01:23:52,650 --> 01:23:56,500
Future Congressman
James Buchanan Barnes.

1339
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:03,500
He's taller in real life,
nice smile too,

1340
01:24:03,530 --> 01:24:05,660
good amount of teeth,
great posture.

1341
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:07,640
He's 110 years old.

1342
01:24:08,550 --> 01:24:09,520
I can work with that.

1343
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:10,610
While the investigation

1344
01:24:10,630 --> 01:24:12,640
into the White House
assassination attempt

1345
01:24:12,660 --> 01:24:14,500
and the shocking shooting at

1346
01:24:14,530 --> 01:24:17,500
Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling
is still under way,

1347
01:24:17,530 --> 01:24:19,560
Isaiah Bradley is set to go

1348
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:20,610
before a military judge
tomorrow.

1349
01:24:20,630 --> 01:24:21,640
I need some air.

1350
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:24,520
It's a stunning
fall from grace for a man

1351
01:24:24,540 --> 01:24:27,480
brought out from the shadows
by Captain America.

1352
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:29,570
Just two years after
being exonerated

1353
01:24:29,590 --> 01:24:30,650
for unjust charges,

1354
01:24:30,670 --> 01:24:34,470
Bradley now finds himself
held in solitary confinement

1355
01:24:34,490 --> 01:24:37,550
and facing a possible
death sentence.

1356
01:24:49,490 --> 01:24:51,560
Okay, reset.
Let's go again.

1357
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:54,590
Talk to me.

1358
01:24:54,610 --> 01:24:56,530
Dunphy,
you check out my report?

1359
01:24:56,550 --> 01:24:57,570
All right,
what am I looking at?

1360
01:24:57,590 --> 01:24:59,500
Those pills you gave me,

1361
01:24:59,530 --> 01:25:00,580
they're loaded
with gamma radiation,

1362
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:02,620
engineered to be
absorbed into the blood.

1363
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:04,520
Where the hell
did you get these?

1364
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:06,470
Shit. I gotta make a call.

1365
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:17,650
This sound is currently
affecting your equilibrium.

1366
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,460
When I turn this dial,

1367
01:25:20,610 --> 01:25:22,640
it will disrupt
your heartbeat.

1368
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:26,460
I take no pleasure
in your death,

1369
01:25:26,590 --> 01:25:28,650
but I can't have you
calling the Captain.

1370
01:25:28,670 --> 01:25:31,600
Who are you?

1371
01:25:32,610 --> 01:25:34,550
Isn't it obvious?

1372
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:36,650
I'm the hero.

1373
01:25:59,470 --> 01:26:00,530
Sir.

1374
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:03,630
Agent Taylor.

1375
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:05,520
Just wanted to let you know

1376
01:26:05,540 --> 01:26:06,580
that every guest
has been screened,

1377
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:08,600
and we also did three sweeps
of the Rose Garden.

1378
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:10,480
Thank you.

1379
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:12,630
-See you out there.
-Yes, sir.

1380
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:34,500
Hello?

1381
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:37,560
Hello. Hi.

1382
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:40,560
I... how are you?

1383
01:26:42,610 --> 01:26:44,490
I'm sorry,
I should have called

1384
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:46,540
after the attack
at the White House.

1385
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:47,640
Are you okay?

1386
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:48,660
Oh...

1387
01:26:49,570 --> 01:26:50,620
I'm fine.

1388
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:53,530
It's really good
to hear your voice.

1389
01:26:55,550 --> 01:26:57,440
I didn't think you'd answer.

1390
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:02,640
Betty, I... I know I've made
a lot of mistakes.

1391
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:09,590
But I'm trying to change,
to be a better person.

1392
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:12,440
Um...

1393
01:27:13,490 --> 01:27:17,580
Maybe we could take a...
a walk sometime?

1394
01:27:18,540 --> 01:27:23,560
See the cherry blossoms,
like the old days.

1395
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:30,630
Yeah. That could be nice.

1396
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:36,460
Okay. I love you.

1397
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:38,470
Bye, Dad.

1398
01:27:58,600 --> 01:27:59,620
Please.

1399
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:02,490
Good afternoon, everyone.

1400
01:28:05,590 --> 01:28:07,450
When I took office,

1401
01:28:07,470 --> 01:28:12,540
I promised we would create
a true, lasting peace.

1402
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:17,600
Today, we begin
to realize that promise.

1403
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:20,620
Captain America...

1404
01:28:23,610 --> 01:28:24,680
would you do me the kindness

1405
01:28:25,450 --> 01:28:29,520
of counseling a bitter man
at the end of his rope?

1406
01:28:29,540 --> 01:28:31,460
That's what you do, isn't it?

1407
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:33,580
Guess we have five minutes

1408
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:35,610
until the MPs drag your ass
outta here.

1409
01:28:35,630 --> 01:28:39,480
You ruined my grand finale
on the Indian Ocean.

1410
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:41,500
So now I'm forced
to turn myself in

1411
01:28:41,530 --> 01:28:42,530
to get what I want.

1412
01:28:42,550 --> 01:28:44,610
Well, if you're waitin'
for an apology,

1413
01:28:44,630 --> 01:28:46,440
we'll be here awhile.

1414
01:28:46,460 --> 01:28:47,660
I'm waiting for you to realize

1415
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:49,680
that we both want
the same thing,

1416
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:52,640
for the world to see Ross
as he truly is.

1417
01:28:53,550 --> 01:28:58,450
I'm proud to say our treaty
will finally be signed.

1418
01:28:58,580 --> 01:29:00,490
I'll take a couple questions.

1419
01:29:00,630 --> 01:29:02,480
Sir, what do you say
to reports

1420
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:03,680
that relations with Japan
broke down

1421
01:29:04,450 --> 01:29:05,440
over your handling

1422
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:06,630
of the White House
assassination attempt?

1423
01:29:06,650 --> 01:29:09,600
Despite fabrications
that some have used

1424
01:29:09,620 --> 01:29:11,560
to turn us against each other,

1425
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:14,590
our bonds have proved strong.

1426
01:29:14,610 --> 01:29:17,440
You kept Ross alive for years.

1427
01:29:17,650 --> 01:29:20,580
Didn't kill him when you had
the chance at the White House.

1428
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:23,520
The way I see it,

1429
01:29:24,570 --> 01:29:27,590
the Indian Ocean
wasn't about starting a war.

1430
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:30,640
You wanted to
destroy his legacy.

1431
01:29:31,650 --> 01:29:33,440
Yes.

1432
01:29:34,570 --> 01:29:36,520
But you haven't
figured out how.

1433
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:37,670
The pills.

1434
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:39,550
I got somebody on that, too.

1435
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:41,610
Not anymore, you don't.

1436
01:29:42,580 --> 01:29:44,590
Is it true hostilities
in the Indian Ocean

1437
01:29:44,610 --> 01:29:46,590
occurred because
the Japanese discovered

1438
01:29:46,610 --> 01:29:48,490
it was, in fact,
your government

1439
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:50,470
who paid for the SERPENT
mercenary group

1440
01:29:50,490 --> 01:29:51,640
to steal their adamantium?

1441
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:54,540
We did not pay them.

1442
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:56,530
Ross turned me into a monster.

1443
01:29:56,650 --> 01:29:59,600
It's only right that I do
the same thing to him.

1444
01:30:00,610 --> 01:30:01,670
Why aren't you smiling?

1445
01:30:02,550 --> 01:30:04,520
-On the ground!
-Hold it!

1446
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,500
You ever use
that big brain of yours

1447
01:30:11,530 --> 01:30:14,530
to consider that maybe
you're wrong about Ross?

1448
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:15,660
Wanna bet?

1449
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:16,650
Yeah.

1450
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:20,530
-Where are you going?
-To stop this.

1451
01:30:21,530 --> 01:30:22,670
Get on the ground, now.

1452
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:25,620
You have the right
to remain silent...

1453
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:26,680
Captain America!

1454
01:30:27,590 --> 01:30:31,560
If I'm right about Ross,
you're going to die.

1455
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:33,570
You're going to die!

1456
01:30:34,660 --> 01:30:37,480
Mr. President,
Dr. Samuel Sterns

1457
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:38,640
just turned himself in.

1458
01:30:39,540 --> 01:30:41,540
He claims you
promised him a pardon

1459
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:44,480
if he worked on secret
government projects for you.

1460
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:45,520
That is a lie.

1461
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:47,660
President Ross,

1462
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:48,680
I miss our little visits.

1463
01:30:49,450 --> 01:30:50,610
What do you want?

1464
01:30:50,630 --> 01:30:52,480
I wanted my life back,

1465
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:53,580
but it's too late
for that now.

1466
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:54,610
Sir...

1467
01:30:54,630 --> 01:30:56,440
I helped you
more than anyone.

1468
01:30:56,460 --> 01:30:57,560
Well, let me explain.

1469
01:30:57,580 --> 01:30:58,620
They have to know.

1470
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:00,580
You gotta
understand my position.

1471
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:04,480
Oh, I do.
You let me rot in this prison.

1472
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:05,610
Leave me alone!

1473
01:31:05,630 --> 01:31:07,580
- Leave me! Let me go!
- Sir! Sir!

1474
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:08,680
I cannot let you.

1475
01:31:09,450 --> 01:31:11,450
-You can't let me? Let me?
-I cannot...

1476
01:31:11,470 --> 01:31:14,660
Everyone will know
just who you are.

1477
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:17,490
And Betty will despise you
even more.

1478
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:18,680
Sir, please.

1479
01:31:28,620 --> 01:31:29,630
Sir.

1480
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:37,640
Oh, my God.

1481
01:31:58,640 --> 01:32:00,540
Since when were they red?

1482
01:32:05,620 --> 01:32:07,450
President Ross?

1483
01:32:10,570 --> 01:32:11,630
Agent Taylor, do we fire?

1484
01:32:48,470 --> 01:32:49,660
This is what Sterns wanted.

1485
01:32:59,650 --> 01:33:00,660
Jesus.

1486
01:33:06,670 --> 01:33:08,570
Sam, I gotta get these people
outta here.

1487
01:33:08,590 --> 01:33:09,630
Set a perimeter
around the White House.

1488
01:33:38,550 --> 01:33:39,590
No.

1489
01:33:39,610 --> 01:33:41,530
Fall back. Fall back!

1490
01:33:48,470 --> 01:33:49,480
Get down!

1491
01:33:51,670 --> 01:33:53,490
Sam, drones incoming.

1492
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:40,470
Ruth, I need you to
clear Hains Point.

1493
01:34:40,490 --> 01:34:41,610
I'll lure Ross there.

1494
01:34:41,630 --> 01:34:43,680
Sam, are you crazy?
He'll kill you.

1495
01:34:44,450 --> 01:34:45,480
Do it!

1496
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:44,550
You can still fight this,
Ross.

1497
01:35:44,570 --> 01:35:46,450
Do you see where you are?

1498
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:50,460
You remember this place?

1499
01:35:51,490 --> 01:35:53,460
You used to come here
with Betty.

1500
01:35:56,540 --> 01:35:57,570
That didn't work.

1501
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:07,520
Okay.

1502
01:36:07,540 --> 01:36:08,560
You want me?

1503
01:36:09,630 --> 01:36:11,470
Come and get me!

1504
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:01,630
Sam?
Sam, can you hear me?

1505
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:03,640
Sam, are you okay?

1506
01:38:10,610 --> 01:38:13,440
Please tell me I knocked
that son of a bitch out.

1507
01:38:19,670 --> 01:38:20,670
Shit.

1508
01:38:26,580 --> 01:38:28,480
Backup's five minutes away.

1509
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:30,500
No, tell them wait.

1510
01:38:30,530 --> 01:38:31,600
What?

1511
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:42,640
Should've taken that serum.

1512
01:38:42,660 --> 01:38:44,620
Bucky is full of shit.

1513
01:38:49,460 --> 01:38:50,580
I'm gonna lose that bet.

1514
01:38:57,640 --> 01:38:58,650
Ross.

1515
01:38:58,670 --> 01:39:01,640
We both know you can
take me out with one punch,

1516
01:39:02,550 --> 01:39:04,480
but I don't think
you wanna do that.

1517
01:39:11,660 --> 01:39:14,670
I know you've done
some terrible things.

1518
01:39:16,650 --> 01:39:18,460
Now, I might be crazy...

1519
01:39:19,530 --> 01:39:21,590
but I think you're
trying to change.

1520
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:24,600
Now's the time to prove it
to the world.

1521
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:27,440
Prove it to Betty.

1522
01:40:22,540 --> 01:40:25,440
The army is transferring
Sterns to a secure facility.

1523
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:27,670
We should get you
to the hospital.

1524
01:40:29,450 --> 01:40:31,450
There's somewhere
we gotta go first.

1525
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:44,670
That's three, old man.

1526
01:40:47,450 --> 01:40:48,560
I told you I'd get you out.

1527
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:50,620
Took you so long?

1528
01:40:55,460 --> 01:40:56,500
Thank you, Sam.

1529
01:40:56,640 --> 01:40:58,470
I got you.

1530
01:40:58,490 --> 01:41:00,440
I have a few broken bones,
so...

1531
01:41:03,610 --> 01:41:05,450
Come on, Mr. Bradley.

1532
01:41:05,470 --> 01:41:07,460
We got a little paperwork
to fill out,

1533
01:41:07,480 --> 01:41:09,440
and then you're free to go.

1534
01:41:15,590 --> 01:41:17,460
Worldwide talks continue

1535
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:20,490
in the arms race
for the new element

1536
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:23,580
as we enter the
brave new world of adamantium.

1537
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:25,660
Back in our nation's capital,
ground was broken

1538
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:28,440
on the restoration
of the White House,

1539
01:41:28,460 --> 01:41:30,600
marking a significant step
towards normalcy

1540
01:41:30,620 --> 01:41:31,590
for the country.

1541
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:51,500
Right this way.

1542
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:03,480
Mr. President.
How're your digs?

1543
01:42:10,660 --> 01:42:12,640
Intentionally uncomfortable.

1544
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:16,530
I heard the food
hasn't got any better either.

1545
01:42:16,550 --> 01:42:18,520
You heard right.

1546
01:42:19,450 --> 01:42:20,530
Bradley got out?

1547
01:42:20,550 --> 01:42:21,520
Yes, sir.

1548
01:42:21,630 --> 01:42:22,660
That's good.

1549
01:42:23,540 --> 01:42:25,540
Mr. President,
about your blood work.

1550
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:27,670
It seems Sterns raised
the level of gamma

1551
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:29,670
in those pills over time.

1552
01:42:30,440 --> 01:42:32,570
It built up in your body
over the years.

1553
01:42:32,590 --> 01:42:33,550
That led to your...

1554
01:42:33,570 --> 01:42:35,460
Led to my little tantrum.

1555
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:37,600
Which is why I have to be
in here.

1556
01:42:39,650 --> 01:42:41,670
Good solid walls, these.

1557
01:42:42,440 --> 01:42:43,460
Yeah.

1558
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:44,670
But I have to say,

1559
01:42:45,550 --> 01:42:46,590
it wasn't nothin' to see you

1560
01:42:46,610 --> 01:42:49,550
take full responsibility
for your actions.

1561
01:42:50,460 --> 01:42:54,450
Give up your office.
Accept your sentence.

1562
01:42:54,470 --> 01:42:56,470
I had to let the country
move on.

1563
01:42:57,540 --> 01:42:59,590
Japan decided to uphold
the treaty, by the way.

1564
01:42:59,610 --> 01:43:00,570
Us too.

1565
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:03,580
The Ozaki-Ross Accords.

1566
01:43:04,530 --> 01:43:05,540
You did it.

1567
01:43:06,440 --> 01:43:07,600
Sam, why are you here?

1568
01:43:08,630 --> 01:43:09,630
Sir?

1569
01:43:11,610 --> 01:43:13,570
We were on different sides
of this thing

1570
01:43:13,590 --> 01:43:14,660
every step of the way.

1571
01:43:16,630 --> 01:43:18,600
Look, if we can't see
the good in each other,

1572
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:21,550
we've already lost the fight.

1573
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:26,540
Besides, I wanted to make sure
an old soldier was okay.

1574
01:43:28,670 --> 01:43:32,550
I'd love to stay, but looks
like you have another visitor.

1575
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:42,640
Hi, Dad.

1576
01:43:46,630 --> 01:43:50,450
I guess I have to give you
a raincheck on that walk.

1577
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:52,600
It's all right.

1578
01:43:54,610 --> 01:43:56,680
We could just sit and talk
for a little while.

1579
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:00,490
I'd like that.

1580
01:44:01,670 --> 01:44:03,470
Me too.

1581
01:44:16,610 --> 01:44:18,450
How's the kid doin' today?

1582
01:44:18,470 --> 01:44:21,480
He's still a little out of it
but doin' better.

1583
01:44:22,550 --> 01:44:23,610
I'm gonna let you two
catch up.

1584
01:44:23,630 --> 01:44:25,680
Hey, where you headed?
Back to Baltimore?

1585
01:44:26,570 --> 01:44:27,570
No.

1586
01:44:28,530 --> 01:44:31,570
I got Ruth and me tickets
for tonight's game, courtside.

1587
01:44:32,450 --> 01:44:34,490
It's the least I could do
for gettin' me out.

1588
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:35,650
You know,
I'm happy you found a friend

1589
01:44:35,670 --> 01:44:37,650
as grumpy as you are
to go to games with.

1590
01:44:40,490 --> 01:44:41,490
Say it again.

1591
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:47,470
I'm playing.
Got you.

1592
01:44:53,470 --> 01:44:55,600
The Falcon awakens.

1593
01:44:57,550 --> 01:44:58,630
Couldn't let you
have all the fun.

1594
01:45:04,540 --> 01:45:06,550
I'm sorry I screwed up.

1595
01:45:06,570 --> 01:45:08,530
Screwed up? Get out of here.

1596
01:45:08,550 --> 01:45:09,590
I did.

1597
01:45:10,470 --> 01:45:11,580
You never messed up
like I have.

1598
01:45:12,650 --> 01:45:14,600
You never got
shot out of the sky

1599
01:45:14,620 --> 01:45:17,610
and nosedived into
the Indian Ocean.

1600
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:20,450
You're always on point.

1601
01:45:22,450 --> 01:45:23,450
Yeah.

1602
01:45:25,470 --> 01:45:26,680
Because if I'm not on point...

1603
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:32,560
I feel like I let down

1604
01:45:32,580 --> 01:45:35,520
everyone else who was fightin'
for a seat at that table.

1605
01:45:38,540 --> 01:45:40,450
That's pressure, man.

1606
01:45:42,470 --> 01:45:43,580
It weighs on you.

1607
01:45:46,660 --> 01:45:49,540
Makes you wonder
if you'll ever just be...

1608
01:45:51,540 --> 01:45:52,600
enough.

1609
01:46:01,680 --> 01:46:03,440
Where I grew up,

1610
01:46:04,540 --> 01:46:06,600
I only ever got
to see heroes online.

1611
01:46:07,470 --> 01:46:08,560
Or on TV.

1612
01:46:10,450 --> 01:46:11,600
It always felt so far away.

1613
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:15,540
And I kept thinkin' maybe
if I get out of Miami,

1614
01:46:16,640 --> 01:46:18,500
you know,
maybe one day I could be...

1615
01:46:18,530 --> 01:46:20,440
Don't say Ant-Man.

1616
01:46:23,530 --> 01:46:24,670
No, man.

1617
01:46:29,450 --> 01:46:30,490
I wanted to be you.

1618
01:46:31,630 --> 01:46:32,590
Well...

1619
01:46:32,610 --> 01:46:34,440
Sam Wilson.

1620
01:46:35,530 --> 01:46:39,540
Because that guy?
That guy won't ever give up.

1621
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:43,450
That pressure,
that responsibility

1622
01:46:43,470 --> 01:46:44,480
you talk about?

1623
01:46:44,650 --> 01:46:46,560
I want that too, man.

1624
01:46:56,440 --> 01:46:57,620
You know it's all
about timin', right?

1625
01:46:58,680 --> 01:47:03,560
Control your spin, then hit
your thruster before you kick.

1626
01:47:07,680 --> 01:47:10,470
- No.
- Yeah.

1627
01:47:10,490 --> 01:47:11,590
No. That's...

1628
01:47:12,470 --> 01:47:13,480
That's it.

1629
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:15,670
I should get shot out
of the sky more often.

1630
01:47:16,440 --> 01:47:17,520
Yeah, you will.

1631
01:47:17,540 --> 01:47:19,560
Okay.

1632
01:47:20,550 --> 01:47:22,550
You know, you're gonna
come back from this.

1633
01:47:23,450 --> 01:47:24,450
I know.

1634
01:47:25,570 --> 01:47:29,630
And when that time comes,
make sure the suit's ready,

1635
01:47:29,650 --> 01:47:31,670
'cause Ross was right
about one thing.

1636
01:47:32,660 --> 01:47:35,470
The world needs the Avengers.

1637
01:47:35,490 --> 01:47:37,550
-For real?
-Yeah.

1638
01:47:37,570 --> 01:47:39,450
Hell, yeah.

1639
01:47:40,660 --> 01:47:42,460
I wasn't thinking
about it before,

1640
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:43,660
but now that
you bring it up...

1641
01:47:43,680 --> 01:47:44,640
Oh, boy.

1642
01:47:44,660 --> 01:47:46,540
...since the wings
are damaged,

1643
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:48,440
I was thinking, I'm like,
what could make--

1644
01:47:48,460 --> 01:47:49,460
No.

1645
01:47:49,480 --> 01:47:50,440
You didn't hear

1646
01:47:50,460 --> 01:47:52,440
-what I was gonna ask you.
-No. Whatever you ask, nope.

1647
01:47:52,460 --> 01:47:54,520
I'm just saying,
maybe you have, like,

1648
01:47:54,540 --> 01:47:55,650
the Wakandans on speed dial

1649
01:47:55,670 --> 01:47:57,480
and could get me some...

1650
01:47:57,500 --> 01:48:00,660
A hookup on an upgrade
on the wings.

1651
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:04,600
You're gonna ask the Wakandans
for a hookup?

1652
01:48:04,620 --> 01:48:05,590
Yeah.

1653
01:48:05,610 --> 01:48:07,530
That is the most Miami thing
in the world.

1654
01:48:07,550 --> 01:48:10,470
Are you kidding? They gonna
hook me up, man. Yo.

1655
01:50:57,060 --> 01:50:58,990
Told you you were gonna
lose that bet.

1656
01:51:00,240 --> 01:51:01,630
You wanna know what's funny?

1657
01:51:02,180 --> 01:51:04,550
I'm not in the mood
for your jokes.

1658
01:51:04,680 --> 01:51:07,580
You killed a lot of good men
trying to get your revenge.

1659
01:51:07,600 --> 01:51:10,540
Trust me, we don't share
the same sense of humor.

1660
01:51:10,830 --> 01:51:13,660
We share the same world,
don't we?

1661
01:51:14,290 --> 01:51:16,390
This world you would
die to save?

1662
01:51:18,550 --> 01:51:19,600
It's coming.

1663
01:51:20,530 --> 01:51:22,500
I've seen it
in the probabilities,

1664
01:51:22,520 --> 01:51:24,500
seen it plain as day.

1665
01:51:25,540 --> 01:51:28,490
All you heroes
protecting this world...

1666
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:31,040
do you think
you're the only ones?

1667
01:51:32,350 --> 01:51:34,460
Do you think
this is the only world?

1668
01:51:36,330 --> 01:51:37,530
We'll see what happens

1669
01:51:37,550 --> 01:51:42,060
when you have to protect
this place from the others.
