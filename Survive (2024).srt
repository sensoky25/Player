1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000


2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000


3
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:20,880
<i>Since its formation, the Earth
has experienced five mass extinctions.</i>

4
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,050
<i>The sixth is just beginning.</i>

5
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:40,090
<i>CARIBBEAN SEA
off the coast of Puerto Rico</i>

6
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,460
Eating that crap again?

7
00:03:03,546 --> 00:03:05,280
Gimme a break. Give it back.

8
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,670
Eat some fruit.

9
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,960
Back off.

10
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Tom!

11
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,130
Help!

12
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:54,920
Help!

13
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:25,460
How about I lock in the kids?

14
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,500
Silly.

15
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,550
- You made a wish?
- Sure, I did.

16
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,250
A good luck charm
to ward off evil spirits.

17
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,590
So soon?

18
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:49,710
- Ben, you good?
- Yeah.

19
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,960
- Okay, Cassie?
- Yes.

20
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,340
What was that?

21
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,750
Be careful.

22
00:14:50,773 --> 00:14:51,840
Hold still.

23
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,920
If you keep moving, I can't do it.

24
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,750
Fucking hell!

25
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,960
Ben, seriously? We're in deep shit here!

26
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,880
Beat it.

27
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,710
Get off my bed. Move!

28
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,300
Fucking move!

29
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,920
It's gross.
You got crumbs everywhere.

30
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,340
Shit!

31
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,670
Watch out!

32
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,670
Mom...

33
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,710
Kids?

34
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:10,590
What?

35
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,340
Honey...

36
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,300
We don't know for sure.

37
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,750
Don't go imagining the worst.

38
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,066
Come on.

39
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,670
Go away.

40
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:01,420
Go away, will you!

41
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,710
We gotta go. Pack up your stuff.

42
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,460
Come on, let's go.

43
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,460
Come with me.

44
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,630
Stop it! Stop!

45
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,300
Cassie!

46
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,420
Mom!

47
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,750
What's going on?

48
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,920
Hide back there!

49
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,420
Mom?

50
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,090
There! Move it!

51
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,210
Get in.

52
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,050
Fast! Come on!

53
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,750
If it's not me, the flare's loaded.

54
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,630
Shoot!

55
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,460
Get it? Shoot if it's not me.

56
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,840
Shoot.

57
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:01,210
Shoot!

58
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,050
Get out!

59
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Get out.

60
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:28,050
Mom, what the hell are you doing?

61
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,050
Forget the supplies!

62
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:36,960
Hurry!

63
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,880
Forget the bags!

64
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,050
Let's go!

65
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:24,210
Drink. A few sips.

66
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:30,590
You think he saw the balloons?

67
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:32,170
What?

68
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:36,250
The psycho.
You think he saw the balloons?

69
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:40,670
Stop.

70
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:41,960
Don't say that.

71
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,170
Don't blame yourself.

72
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,920
There was no way of knowing.

73
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:57,340
Don't blame yourself, okay?

74
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,550
It's not your fault. Got it?

75
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,050
It's not your fault.

76
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,550
I'll do all I can to protect you.

77
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:09,590
I won't let anyone hurt you.

78
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:11,380
No one.

79
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:07,090
What?

80
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:16,590
Come on!

81
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:39,960
Go!

82
00:48:58,170 --> 00:48:59,170
Keep going!

83
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:43,630
What's wrong?

84
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,420
Dehydration. You need fluids.

85
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:49,380
Hold on.

86
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:06,550
Who the hell did this?

87
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:08,710
Drink what's left.

88
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:13,920
I think I left it unscrewed.

89
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:15,706
Shit, Cassie, it's empty!

90
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:17,420
It wasn't on purpose.

91
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:19,380
How do we survive without water?

92
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:21,460
Don't yell at me. Back off.

93
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:24,170
It's not like we won't die anyway.

94
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:26,840
- Don't say that!
- Why? We're gonna croak.

95
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,400
It's the truth!
You think you can save us

96
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,986
but you can't!

97
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:32,186
Nobody can save us.

98
00:50:32,213 --> 00:50:35,130
We're gonna croak here.
Dad got slaughtered by a freak.

99
00:50:35,173 --> 00:50:38,540
and you're obsessed about a bottle.
A fucking bottle!

100
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:39,800
Enough!

101
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,893
Shut up, that's enough!

102
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:42,920
Shut up!

103
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:29,880
Go right.

104
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:51,750
Thanks.

105
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:58,380
Try to get some sleep.

106
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:37,380
I can't believe he's gone forever.

107
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:40,550
I feel like...

108
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:44,550
I've fallen off a cliff.

109
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:48,210
I know.

110
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,920
Tell me the story of how you met again.

111
00:54:01,333 --> 00:54:03,130
The first time I saw him,

112
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:05,210
I was 22.

113
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,340
I was training

114
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:11,800
at the hospital in Nice.

115
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:14,550
And one morning...

116
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:19,250
a German was brought in
after a diving accident.

117
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:21,300
What was he doing?

118
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,840
Research for his thesis

119
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:28,300
on red gorgonians dying out
in the Mediterranean.

120
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:30,000
On what?

121
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,130
They look like coral.

122
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:35,500
Anyway, he'd had a...

123
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:39,840
decompression issue on a dive.

124
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:45,960
He spent three days
in a hyperbaric chamber.

125
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,520
There are better first meetings.

126
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:51,550
As soon as he got out,
he started hitting on me.

127
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:53,300
It worked?

128
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:55,090
Not right away.

129
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:56,630
I set him straight.

130
00:54:57,630 --> 00:54:58,340
As his doctor.

131
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:02,380
As if that would stop him.

132
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:06,170
Two days later,
outside the hospital,

133
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:09,420
he was waiting with flowers.

134
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:11,250
Old school.

135
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,380
We spent a whole week together.

136
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:15,210
It was...

137
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:20,960
He had to go back to Germany.

138
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:23,250
I thought...

139
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:26,000
I'd never see him again.

140
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:30,420
And then?

141
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,500
Six months later, he...

142
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:37,130
He was there,
outside the hospital.

143
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:39,420
And...

144
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:42,630
he declared his undying love.

145
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:45,210
With a poem by Victor Hugo.

146
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:51,000
"It's enough for you to fly away.

147
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:55,170
"For me to fly too."

148
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:01,000
Then,

149
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:03,380
he explained

150
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:05,250
he'd got his degree

151
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:07,590
and been offered a job in Miami.

152
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:10,550
And he'd only accept it

153
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:13,500
if I agreed to go with him.

154
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:15,710
Not an easy decision.

155
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:19,050
To practice in the USA,
I had to requalify.

156
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,880
You know what he said?

157
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,250
Every problem has a solution.

158
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,800
Every problem has a solution.

159
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:26,130
What could have done this?

160
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:29,050
Whatever it was, it's not human.

161
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:32,460
So there's something out there
even nastier than this wacko.

162
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:47,170
Come on.

163
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,590
Let's go.

164
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:31,800
Wait!

165
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:42,590
Where you going?

166
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:44,130
Wait for us.

167
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:02,346
Get out of there right now!

168
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:03,710
Don't!

169
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:08,670
Are you nuts? You'll get sick!

170
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:10,300
Kids!

171
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:12,670
We can't stay here.

172
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:14,750
What's going on?

173
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,080
Move it!

174
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:50,800
Look!

175
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:52,710
People.

176
01:04:54,380 --> 01:04:55,550
Let's go.

177
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:05,920
There's a woman and children!

178
01:05:06,090 --> 01:05:07,340
Forget about it.

179
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,050
Look, behind them!

180
01:05:11,090 --> 01:05:11,960
Help!

181
01:05:12,130 --> 01:05:14,420
There's more of them. Get inside!

182
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:15,750
Help us!

183
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,590
Go on, Cassie, climb up.

184
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:54,960
Keep going!

185
01:05:58,250 --> 01:05:59,300
C'mon, kids.

186
01:05:59,550 --> 01:06:00,800
Back up.

187
01:08:34,130 --> 01:08:35,340
Mom!

188
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,210
We went for help. There's no one!

189
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:49,670
Where's Ben?

190
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:02,420
Where'd you learn to do that?

191
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:26,420
Cassie, keep watch.

192
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:30,420
Shit, a radio!

193
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:32,453
Grab that gun!

194
01:10:59,090 --> 01:11:00,420
Work, dammit.

195
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:03,880
Channel 16.

196
01:11:05,130 --> 01:11:06,170
Work.

197
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:11,420
Nao?

198
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,500
Look, over there.

199
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:37,840
Shit...

200
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,090
That rift.

201
01:13:49,670 --> 01:13:50,460
Let's go.

202
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:57,880
What's with "save my children" earlier?

203
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:00,386
Ben, c'mon!

204
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:45,550
Mom, all good?

205
01:14:45,710 --> 01:14:46,800
Keep going.

206
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:12,550
Watch out!

207
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:14,000
Hurry!

208
01:15:36,050 --> 01:15:37,420
Here we go again.

209
01:15:41,050 --> 01:15:41,960
Shit!

210
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:46,500
Watch out!

211
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:22,960
Mom?

212
01:16:29,170 --> 01:16:30,300
Climb over!

213
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:32,340
Hold on, listen to me.

214
01:16:33,090 --> 01:16:34,170
Keep going!

215
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,550
- What?
- Just go!

216
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:40,300
No!

217
01:16:42,090 --> 01:16:44,000
Keep going, I said!

218
01:16:44,170 --> 01:16:45,630
No, climb over it!

219
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:47,050
Just go!

220
01:16:47,210 --> 01:16:48,380
Climb over it!

221
01:16:48,630 --> 01:16:49,750
Hurry!

222
01:16:50,170 --> 01:16:51,050
Climb!

223
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:58,590
Mom, we're not going anywhere.

224
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:01,920
Come with us, for fuck's sake!

225
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:05,800
Not without you!

226
01:17:09,813 --> 01:17:12,160
Take Ben and go!

227
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:14,380
You hear me? Just go!

228
01:17:22,050 --> 01:17:23,250
I'll find you.

229
01:17:24,210 --> 01:17:25,840
I'll find you. Now go!

230
01:17:29,550 --> 01:17:31,626
We're going. Come on!

231
01:17:43,466 --> 01:17:44,710
Careful.

232
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:57,590
There!

233
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:15,420
Nao!

234
01:18:58,130 --> 01:18:59,000
Wait!

235
01:19:58,710 --> 01:19:59,500
Come on.

236
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:01,670
Grab my hand.
There's room for you.

237
01:20:59,550 --> 01:21:00,840
Climb up, come on.

238
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:05,300
Give me that.

239
01:21:05,630 --> 01:21:06,500
Give me that.

240
01:21:06,670 --> 01:21:07,340
Inside!

241
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:08,550
Go on, get in.

242
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:10,170
C'mon, now!

243
01:21:10,420 --> 01:21:11,800
- Fast!
- Get inside!

244
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:13,130
Hurry up, Ben!

245
01:21:27,710 --> 01:21:28,750
How does this shut?

246
01:21:30,340 --> 01:21:31,460
Turn it.

247
01:21:32,130 --> 01:21:33,170
We're good.

248
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:36,090
Push it.

249
01:22:01,630 --> 01:22:03,920
Sit down. Get in your seats!

250
01:22:04,340 --> 01:22:05,250
Fast!

251
01:22:07,710 --> 01:22:08,920
Strap in!

252
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:14,630
- Fuck it!
- Look...

253
01:22:15,210 --> 01:22:16,460
Cross them in front.

254
01:25:37,170 --> 01:25:40,380
SURVIVE
