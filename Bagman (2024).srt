1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000


2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000


3
00:00:38,588 --> 00:00:39,681
Beautiful.

4
00:00:39,681 --> 00:00:42,487
Focus more on the arm whip
than wrist snap, okay?

5
00:00:43,893 --> 00:00:45,424
It'll give you more velocity.

6
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:49,824
I had a long talk
with Mom this morning.

7
00:00:51,364 --> 00:00:53,432
She said your bad dreams
are getting worse.

8
00:00:55,132 --> 00:00:57,038
She also said

9
00:00:57,038 --> 00:00:58,701
there was something
you needed to tell me.

10
00:01:00,338 --> 00:01:02,339
Remember... Remember that day

11
00:01:02,339 --> 00:01:05,211
you let me ride my bike
to practice?

12
00:01:05,211 --> 00:01:07,174
You rode through
the storm drain, didn't you?

13
00:01:07,174 --> 00:01:08,579
By the old mine.

14
00:01:09,313 --> 00:01:10,482
Why? Did something happen?

15
00:01:11,447 --> 00:01:13,285
No. Nothing happened, Dad.

16
00:01:13,285 --> 00:01:15,586
I just freaked myself out a bit.
That's all.

17
00:01:18,461 --> 00:01:20,591
Is that why you
started carrying around
Bunny Bear again?

18
00:01:25,999 --> 00:01:27,528
Before you say no,

19
00:01:27,528 --> 00:01:29,235
Mom thinks
one way of tackling this

20
00:01:29,235 --> 00:01:31,301
is for you to let go
of some of the things

21
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:33,373
you needed
when you were little.

22
00:01:34,972 --> 00:01:36,473
I agree.

23
00:01:36,473 --> 00:01:39,780
But we also agree
that when that happens,

24
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,150
it's entirely up to you.

25
00:01:43,448 --> 00:01:44,513
Let me toss the gear
in the shed,

26
00:01:44,513 --> 00:01:45,616
and then we can
go grab some pizza.

27
00:02:29,026 --> 00:02:30,232
Dad?

28
00:02:37,768 --> 00:02:38,669
Dad?

29
00:02:40,172 --> 00:02:41,375
Dad, are you in there?

30
00:02:44,547 --> 00:02:45,610
Dad?

31
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:09,969
Dad?

32
00:03:09,969 --> 00:03:11,202
Dad, what's happening?

33
00:03:11,202 --> 00:03:12,736
Dad!

34
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:15,204
Run!

35
00:03:15,204 --> 00:03:16,707
No!

36
00:05:40,116 --> 00:05:42,917
<i>♪ Deep in the green wood

00:05:42,917 --> 00:05:45,188

41
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,308
Five more minutes. Okay, dude?

42
00:05:59,308 --> 00:06:01,370
I thought we said
no more <i>Bunny Hop.</i>

43
00:06:02,704 --> 00:06:04,439
It's better than
<i>Little Baby Bum.</i>

44
00:06:07,046 --> 00:06:08,048
Hey.

45
00:06:08,048 --> 00:06:10,083
Hey, babe. You look awful.

46
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,915
You look like a waffle.

47
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,087
Yeah, well,
I didn't sleep for shit.

48
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:20,388
I thought you said you were
gonna stop working so late.

49
00:06:20,388 --> 00:06:22,426
It wasn't that.

50
00:06:22,426 --> 00:06:23,559
There were deer or something

51
00:06:23,559 --> 00:06:25,632
- in the backyard again.
- Hmm.

52
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,436
What time is it?

53
00:06:28,936 --> 00:06:30,439
10:17.

54
00:06:31,235 --> 00:06:32,401
Why?

55
00:06:32,401 --> 00:06:33,873
Oh, I don't know.

56
00:06:33,873 --> 00:06:35,070
My sister?

57
00:06:36,078 --> 00:06:37,076
Liam and the girls?

58
00:06:37,076 --> 00:06:38,612
11:00 a.m. brunch?

59
00:06:39,578 --> 00:06:41,577
Family brunch.

60
00:06:41,577 --> 00:06:43,914
Okay. I am going to shower.

61
00:06:45,288 --> 00:06:46,851
Come on.

62
00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:52,589
You're a zombie.
You're a zombie.

63
00:06:52,589 --> 00:06:54,756
I'm gonna... Come.
I'll get you!

64
00:06:54,756 --> 00:06:55,890
You're gonna
give him nightmares.

65
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,562
You're a zombie!
Please, he loves it.

66
00:06:57,562 --> 00:06:58,560
Don't you, <i>ti cheri?</i>

67
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,967
Yes, let Auntie eat you!

68
00:07:02,665 --> 00:07:04,435
Was there a blackout
last night?

69
00:07:04,435 --> 00:07:07,268
Uh, no,
not that I know of. Why?

70
00:07:07,268 --> 00:07:10,006
Clocks are all out of whack,
and the fridge is defrosted.

71
00:07:11,046 --> 00:07:11,942
Oh!

72
00:07:14,113 --> 00:07:15,481
Oh, wow.

73
00:07:15,481 --> 00:07:17,215
Yeah, the place
looks amazing, Karina.

74
00:07:17,215 --> 00:07:18,316
Thank you, Arlene.

75
00:07:18,316 --> 00:07:20,251
Yeah, it's getting there.

76
00:07:20,251 --> 00:07:21,182
Yeah, it's great.

77
00:07:23,555 --> 00:07:24,823
It's so not getting there.

78
00:07:25,356 --> 00:07:26,754
Mmm.

79
00:07:26,754 --> 00:07:28,563
It was probably just a possum.

80
00:07:30,126 --> 00:07:32,193
I caught one under my grill
the other night.

81
00:07:33,201 --> 00:07:34,729
Almost shat myself.

82
00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:36,131
It sounded like
a person to me.

83
00:07:37,504 --> 00:07:38,833
Then it was kids
drinking forties

84
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:39,904
in the woods like
we used to do.

85
00:07:40,869 --> 00:07:42,973
It sounded like one person.

86
00:07:44,676 --> 00:07:45,679
Got a gun in the house?

87
00:07:46,378 --> 00:07:48,416
Are you nuts?

88
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,346
All Dad ever needed
was his Henry Aaron.

89
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,522
Different era, my friend.

90
00:07:58,259 --> 00:07:59,055
Hey, check this out.

91
00:08:03,961 --> 00:08:06,667
Finally got the mechanics
working perfect.

92
00:08:13,908 --> 00:08:17,478
My loan agent might be willing
to give me an extension.

93
00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:21,011
But only if I cut
production costs by half.

94
00:08:24,953 --> 00:08:26,248
I, uh...

95
00:08:26,248 --> 00:08:29,183
You know, I thought we agreed
you were gonna let that go.

96
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,021
That you were gonna
get those loans paid off.

97
00:08:39,601 --> 00:08:42,837
Whatever you say, boss.

98
00:08:42,837 --> 00:08:45,607
<i>So how's Pat doing with
the move back to New Jersey?</i>

99
00:08:46,206 --> 00:08:47,208
Stressed.

100
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,907
- Mmm.
- Barely sleeping.

101
00:08:49,808 --> 00:08:50,706
It killed him
to come back here

102
00:08:50,706 --> 00:08:51,941
and take the job with Liam,

103
00:08:51,941 --> 00:08:54,312
but the reality
is he couldn't find anyone

104
00:08:54,312 --> 00:08:56,044
to fund his designs.

105
00:08:56,044 --> 00:08:58,484
Our medical benefits
are about to expire.

106
00:08:58,484 --> 00:08:59,849
If his mom
hadn't moved to Arizona,

107
00:08:59,849 --> 00:09:01,816
we would be
at the YMCA right now.

108
00:09:01,816 --> 00:09:03,222
Ahh!

109
00:09:03,222 --> 00:09:05,021
Hey, honey.

110
00:09:05,021 --> 00:09:07,761
Please, please don't play
Fute so loud. Okay?

111
00:10:44,755 --> 00:10:45,925
Screw this.

112
00:10:59,937 --> 00:11:01,171
Hey, listen.

113
00:11:05,244 --> 00:11:07,375
It's fine with me if you guys
are partying out here.

114
00:11:15,319 --> 00:11:17,491
But don't blame me
if I bash someone's face in

115
00:11:17,491 --> 00:11:18,727
'cause you don't
wanna get caught.

116
00:11:33,603 --> 00:11:34,435
Shit.

117
00:11:36,407 --> 00:11:37,273
Oh, my God.

118
00:12:15,483 --> 00:12:16,312
Listen, Patty.

119
00:12:18,921 --> 00:12:21,550
I know you're still down
about how things played out,

120
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,023
but you should be proud
that you had the balls
to go for it.

121
00:12:24,923 --> 00:12:26,256
Be careful what you wish for.

122
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:30,128
Remember when I took over
the yard after Dad died?

123
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,435
Had nightmares
every goddamn night

124
00:12:33,435 --> 00:12:36,701
about them
repossessing our car

125
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:38,004
or foreclosing on the house.

126
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,041
Those are my good dreams,
Liam.

127
00:12:46,681 --> 00:12:49,315
Ever since we moved back home,

128
00:12:49,315 --> 00:12:51,820
I've been having
these white-knucklers about
Jake getting snatched.

129
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,149
We're in the backyard.

130
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:58,153
Or maybe it's a park
or a playground.

131
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:00,290
I just get this bad feeling,
you know?

132
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,326
You know
who I blame for that shit?

133
00:13:12,236 --> 00:13:13,809
Yeah, I could really
use him right now.

134
00:13:14,407 --> 00:13:15,772
Yeah.

135
00:13:15,772 --> 00:13:17,307
You and me both, brother.

136
00:13:20,815 --> 00:13:22,312
Meet me over
at the kiln in 20.

137
00:13:23,218 --> 00:13:24,215
Yeah.

138
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:33,026
<i>Can you
please stop doing that
for three seconds?</i>

139
00:13:35,028 --> 00:13:36,292
This is Irish Walnut.

140
00:13:36,292 --> 00:13:37,931
If I leave it for too long,
it'll get chalky.

141
00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:39,499
I don't care
if it's Scottish scrotum.

142
00:13:39,499 --> 00:13:40,929
We're on a mission here.

143
00:13:42,464 --> 00:13:44,202
Dad always says
to never come down here.

144
00:13:44,202 --> 00:13:46,302
"Dad always said
never to come down here."

145
00:13:46,302 --> 00:13:48,505
You're just scared of what
might be inside there.

146
00:13:51,042 --> 00:13:53,846
Liam, have you ever thought...

147
00:13:53,846 --> 00:13:55,345
What if the things
they say are true?

148
00:13:56,147 --> 00:13:57,983
Don't be a moron.

149
00:13:57,983 --> 00:14:00,350
I hate to be the one
to tell you this, but...

150
00:14:01,355 --> 00:14:02,352
Bingo!

151
00:14:11,228 --> 00:14:12,901
Okay, we saw it.
Can we go home now?

152
00:14:14,097 --> 00:14:15,101
I dare you to go over there.

153
00:14:16,703 --> 00:14:17,937
I double dare you.

154
00:14:17,937 --> 00:14:19,237
Or I'll tell everybody
what a pussy you were.

155
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,136
I triple dare you to do it.

156
00:14:21,136 --> 00:14:22,436
I already did it,
like, 10 times.

157
00:14:22,436 --> 00:14:23,739
Then you shouldn't
be afraid to do it again.

158
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:24,605
Should you?

159
00:14:40,825 --> 00:14:42,062
I wanna go home.

160
00:14:42,792 --> 00:14:43,998
Yeah.

161
00:14:44,961 --> 00:14:46,132
Yeah, me too.

162
00:14:47,798 --> 00:14:48,629
Holy crap.

163
00:14:51,236 --> 00:14:53,371
- That's a wild plum tree.
- Who cares?

164
00:14:53,371 --> 00:14:55,770
Grandpa said
it's the softest wood
in the entire world.

165
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:56,637
Patty.

166
00:14:59,908 --> 00:15:01,114
Pat.

167
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,117
Pat!

168
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,580
Get away from there, Patty.

169
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,116
Help me
pull this tree down first.

170
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,518
No frickin' way.

171
00:15:09,518 --> 00:15:10,990
I'm not leaving
until I get a piece!

172
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,353
If you don't let go right now,

173
00:15:12,353 --> 00:15:13,695
I'm totally telling Dad
we came here.

174
00:15:13,695 --> 00:15:15,895
- Dude. You're the pussy.
- Screw you.

175
00:15:15,895 --> 00:15:17,365
I'm leaving
if you don't get away...

176
00:15:23,132 --> 00:15:24,372
Sweet.

177
00:15:24,372 --> 00:15:25,571
You're too close.

178
00:15:25,571 --> 00:15:27,008
Seriously, Patty.

179
00:15:41,284 --> 00:15:42,452
Almost got it.

180
00:16:16,023 --> 00:16:17,886
- Are you holding on?
- Yes, I am.

181
00:16:17,886 --> 00:16:19,453
Okay, good.

182
00:16:19,453 --> 00:16:21,527
How many more times
you wanna do it?

183
00:16:21,527 --> 00:16:22,663
One thousand.

184
00:16:22,663 --> 00:16:24,491
- I gotta stop, okay?
- Again.

185
00:16:24,491 --> 00:16:26,534
No. I know you want
to go again, baby,

186
00:16:26,534 --> 00:16:27,497
but I have to work, okay?

187
00:16:28,031 --> 00:16:29,130
Stop.

188
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,839
All right. I know.

189
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,603
Come on, then.
Let's go over here.

190
00:16:33,603 --> 00:16:35,805
So maybe we can go when Daddy
gets back from work, okay?

191
00:16:35,805 --> 00:16:36,704
Okay.

192
00:16:48,388 --> 00:16:49,519
Jakie.

193
00:16:54,926 --> 00:16:56,361
Jakie, stop.

194
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,035
I said stop!

195
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:04,369
I'm sorry.

196
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:08,335
Mommy just needs
some quiet for a bit. Okay?

197
00:17:08,335 --> 00:17:09,539
Can you do that for me, please?

198
00:17:10,975 --> 00:17:12,245
Okay.

199
00:17:13,042 --> 00:17:14,313
Thank you.

200
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,116
Jake?

201
00:17:50,782 --> 00:17:51,949
Jake?

202
00:17:51,949 --> 00:17:53,583
Jakie, where are you?

203
00:17:55,787 --> 00:17:56,652
Jake?

204
00:17:59,956 --> 00:18:01,096
Jakie?

205
00:18:02,427 --> 00:18:04,027
If you don't come out
in three seconds,

206
00:18:04,027 --> 00:18:05,430
no dessert tonight, okay?

207
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:10,798
Jakie?

208
00:18:12,441 --> 00:18:13,504
Jakie?

209
00:18:15,004 --> 00:18:15,805
Jakie!

210
00:18:15,805 --> 00:18:17,139
Jake?

211
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:19,147
Jakie! Where are you?

212
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,129
I'll take the one.
That's the one.

213
00:18:39,129 --> 00:18:41,631
Jakie! Come to Mommy, okay?

214
00:19:01,922 --> 00:19:03,191
Hello. We're here.

215
00:19:06,124 --> 00:19:08,328
Ooh! Look at this!

216
00:19:09,325 --> 00:19:10,396
Jakie! Come out!

217
00:19:14,063 --> 00:19:15,401
Jakie!

218
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:18,803
Jakie!

219
00:19:20,707 --> 00:19:21,671
Jakie?

220
00:19:22,238 --> 00:19:24,006
Jakie? Jakie!

221
00:19:24,006 --> 00:19:25,873
Jakie! Jakie!

222
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:27,240
Jake.

223
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,810
Oh, my God.

224
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:31,477
Don't you ever run away
from me like that again, okay?

225
00:19:31,477 --> 00:19:32,948
Let's go home. Okay, baby?

226
00:19:32,948 --> 00:19:34,215
Okay?

227
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:44,760
Let's go home, baby, okay?

228
00:19:45,569 --> 00:19:46,597
We go home.

229
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:17,628
Hey, buddy.

230
00:20:21,831 --> 00:20:23,897
How's your day been?

231
00:20:23,897 --> 00:20:26,274
Good, good.
"Good, good," good?

232
00:20:31,245 --> 00:20:32,677
Okay. All right.

233
00:20:32,677 --> 00:20:34,744
- That's enough Fute now, okay?
-Slow down, buddy.

234
00:20:36,482 --> 00:20:37,780
Jakie!

235
00:20:40,283 --> 00:20:41,751
Oh, poor Daddy.

236
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:48,123
Oh, my God.

237
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:49,495
Put him down.

238
00:20:53,527 --> 00:20:57,998
<i>♪ Ding, ding, dong ♪</i>

239
00:21:11,482 --> 00:21:12,713
<i>Wanna watch that show</i>

240
00:21:12,713 --> 00:21:14,347
<i>your sister
was telling us about?</i>

241
00:21:14,347 --> 00:21:15,653
It's too heavy.

242
00:21:16,353 --> 00:21:17,787
Anything on the queue?

243
00:21:18,286 --> 00:21:19,555
Mm-hmm.

244
00:21:19,555 --> 00:21:22,462
250 movies
we'll never actually watch.

245
00:21:31,235 --> 00:21:32,472
What's wrong?

246
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,684
I almost lost him today.

247
00:21:50,221 --> 00:21:51,991
Lost him how?

248
00:21:51,991 --> 00:21:53,689
I... I was trying to work,

249
00:21:53,689 --> 00:21:56,260
and he was just playing
the stupid recorder

250
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,762
and I just lost it. I snapped.

251
00:22:00,335 --> 00:22:02,465
I took my eye off him
for one second,

252
00:22:02,465 --> 00:22:03,965
and he wandered
into the woods...

253
00:22:03,965 --> 00:22:06,836
and I... I panicked, and all
I could think about was...

254
00:22:16,886 --> 00:22:17,847
Are we gonna be okay?

255
00:24:20,173 --> 00:24:21,303
Again.

256
00:24:27,345 --> 00:24:28,142
Again, again.

257
00:24:31,013 --> 00:24:33,348
Hey, who you
talking to, buddy?

258
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:34,654
Dolly.

259
00:24:35,484 --> 00:24:36,689
To Dolly?

260
00:24:37,223 --> 00:24:38,152
Dolly.

261
00:24:40,323 --> 00:24:42,057
Dolly.

262
00:24:51,568 --> 00:24:53,270
Is there a moth in here?

263
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,537
Mmm-mmm. Just Dolly.

264
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:58,007
Come on. Lie down, kiddo.

265
00:24:59,213 --> 00:25:00,141
Let's get you tucked in.

266
00:25:03,349 --> 00:25:05,014
Where did you go?
Where'd you go?

267
00:25:07,751 --> 00:25:11,722
Okay, buddy, go into the light.

268
00:25:11,722 --> 00:25:13,792
There's peace and tranquility
in the light.

269
00:25:15,463 --> 00:25:17,191
All are welcome.

270
00:25:18,297 --> 00:25:20,562
All are welcome.

271
00:25:25,903 --> 00:25:27,608
All are not welcome.

272
00:26:46,748 --> 00:26:47,952
Pat?

273
00:26:51,487 --> 00:26:52,319
Pat?

274
00:26:54,257 --> 00:26:55,157
I'm here.

275
00:26:58,761 --> 00:26:59,964
What are you doing?

276
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:03,066
I think there's somebody
out there.

277
00:27:04,204 --> 00:27:06,135
Oh. What?

278
00:27:09,104 --> 00:27:11,112
Don't bother.

279
00:27:11,112 --> 00:27:12,141
The power's out again.

280
00:27:13,645 --> 00:27:14,847
Just come here and listen.

281
00:27:15,878 --> 00:27:17,080
You're freaking me out, Pat.

282
00:27:17,612 --> 00:27:18,818
Just...

283
00:27:21,387 --> 00:27:22,684
Just listen.

284
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:23,784
What am I listening for?

285
00:27:23,784 --> 00:27:27,090
This weird zipping sound.

286
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:29,664
I couldn't, for the life of me,
place it until just now.

287
00:27:30,663 --> 00:27:32,828
Like a rucksack or duffel bag.

288
00:27:32,828 --> 00:27:34,531
Somebody's opening
and closing it

289
00:27:34,531 --> 00:27:35,901
just to mess with my head.

290
00:27:36,667 --> 00:27:37,936
Come on, Pat. Seriously?

291
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:42,807
As soon as I figure out
where this asshole is hiding,

292
00:27:42,807 --> 00:27:44,374
I'm gonna kick his goddamn...

293
00:27:44,374 --> 00:27:45,507
Oh, shit, Jake.

294
00:27:46,609 --> 00:27:48,042
Hello. Hi. Yeah.

295
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:49,148
Yeah, someone's breaking
into our house.

296
00:27:49,148 --> 00:27:50,110
Jake?

297
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,618
Yeah,
it's 109 Walter Ave.

298
00:27:51,618 --> 00:27:52,948
Hey, buddy. Hey, buddy.
Daddy's here, all right?

299
00:27:52,948 --> 00:27:54,381
- Yes. Yeah, please hurry.
- I got you.

300
00:27:55,587 --> 00:27:56,916
Thank you. Please.

301
00:28:00,923 --> 00:28:02,125
Go ahead, take him.

302
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:05,091
Where're you going?

303
00:28:05,091 --> 00:28:06,728
- I'm going downstairs.
- Pat, no.

304
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:09,300
Just stay inside, okay?

305
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,199
Close the door.

306
00:29:16,196 --> 00:29:17,772
You wanna
mess with me, man?

307
00:29:18,703 --> 00:29:19,939
Yeah, I'm right here.

308
00:29:21,606 --> 00:29:22,403
I'm right here!

309
00:29:49,832 --> 00:29:50,964
Pat.

310
00:29:50,964 --> 00:29:52,601
I said stay upstairs!

311
00:29:54,673 --> 00:29:55,909
What the hell is going on?

312
00:29:58,577 --> 00:29:59,440
Are you okay?

313
00:30:00,811 --> 00:30:02,014
Are you okay, babe?

314
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:04,346
Come on. Go for it.

315
00:30:18,531 --> 00:30:19,560
Hey.

316
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,126
Hey.

317
00:30:21,126 --> 00:30:22,934
I'd say welcome home, Pat,

318
00:30:22,934 --> 00:30:25,466
but somebody obviously
beat me to the punch.

319
00:30:26,906 --> 00:30:29,038
- You must be Karina. Hey.
- Hi.

320
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:31,874
As far as the perp
gettin' inside...

321
00:30:31,874 --> 00:30:34,341
there's not a lot to go on.

322
00:30:34,341 --> 00:30:37,011
Well, I know for a fact
the doors were locked.

323
00:30:37,011 --> 00:30:38,479
You guys have a hide-a-key?

324
00:30:39,386 --> 00:30:40,485
Oh, yeah.

325
00:30:40,485 --> 00:30:41,581
Yes. Yeah, we do.

326
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,858
Right here.

327
00:30:50,858 --> 00:30:52,498
Ah. Okay.

328
00:30:52,498 --> 00:30:54,560
Most likely scenario is,

329
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,967
somebody saw the length
of the grass in your yard,

330
00:30:57,967 --> 00:30:59,299
thought you might be
outta town

331
00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:01,367
and decided to make
an impulse buy.

332
00:31:01,367 --> 00:31:04,811
So, why didn't
they steal anything?

333
00:31:04,811 --> 00:31:06,375
You're positive
nothing's missing?

334
00:31:07,715 --> 00:31:09,917
Yeah, not as far
as we can tell.

335
00:31:09,917 --> 00:31:12,348
Do me a favor.
Go through the house again.

336
00:31:12,348 --> 00:31:14,886
Make a list of anything
that's not where it should be.

337
00:31:14,886 --> 00:31:16,919
No matter
how small or insignificant.

338
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:19,354
Yeah. I'll start
in the kitchen.

339
00:31:19,354 --> 00:31:21,594
Yeah, it felt more like
he was trying to scare us.

340
00:31:21,594 --> 00:31:23,392
Yeah, he did a good job too.

341
00:31:25,525 --> 00:31:27,528
Hey, Chief, you're gonna
wanna take a look at this.

342
00:31:28,797 --> 00:31:29,997
Pat...

343
00:31:29,997 --> 00:31:31,334
Can you come upstairs?

344
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:34,469
Sure.

345
00:31:36,472 --> 00:31:38,339
A lot of these break-ins
where it looks like

346
00:31:38,339 --> 00:31:40,781
there was an ulterior motive
to robbery,

347
00:31:40,781 --> 00:31:43,181
turns out somebody
is sendin' a message.

348
00:31:46,315 --> 00:31:48,954
You sure
you didn't know this guy?

349
00:31:48,954 --> 00:31:50,419
Well, I mean,
I never got a look at him.

350
00:31:53,654 --> 00:31:56,326
You let me know
if you remember anything else.

351
00:31:57,364 --> 00:31:58,361
Okay?

352
00:31:58,761 --> 00:32:00,099
Okay.

353
00:32:02,471 --> 00:32:03,771
What do we got, Rawls?

354
00:32:03,771 --> 00:32:05,431
Well,
I'm not entirely sure, sir.

355
00:32:05,431 --> 00:32:07,370
Don't suppose
you made these?

356
00:32:09,642 --> 00:32:10,976
Yeah.

357
00:32:10,976 --> 00:32:13,673
Uh, yeah,
all the time when I was a kid.

358
00:32:14,982 --> 00:32:16,945
There're boxes of 'em
in the garage.

359
00:32:16,945 --> 00:32:19,479
You know, it seems to me like
someone was squatting here
like this, and, you know,

360
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,920
tossing them. Like so.

361
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,320
Maybe drawin'
your son's attention?

362
00:32:24,019 --> 00:32:25,058
Look...

363
00:32:25,824 --> 00:32:27,124
Tell 'em I sent you.

364
00:32:27,124 --> 00:32:29,091
They'll rig your whole house
for a song.

365
00:32:29,091 --> 00:32:32,131
And mow your lawn,
for chrissake.

366
00:32:56,689 --> 00:32:57,486
Jakie.

367
00:33:26,388 --> 00:33:27,450
Holy shit.

368
00:33:32,187 --> 00:33:35,022
Daddy, look at this.

369
00:33:35,022 --> 00:33:36,525
Very cool, buddy.

370
00:33:36,525 --> 00:33:39,528
Hey, so, pile on the right
goes back on the shelves.

371
00:33:39,528 --> 00:33:42,362
Everything on the left,
we can bag and toss outside.

372
00:33:42,362 --> 00:33:44,231
This asshole
really did rob us,

373
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:45,303
he needs a new line of work.

374
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,437
Where the hell
did you find this?

375
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:52,673
Uh, I've never seen that
before in my life.

376
00:33:52,673 --> 00:33:54,711
So, what's it doing in
the bottom of the wastebasket

377
00:33:54,711 --> 00:33:55,676
in my office?

378
00:33:56,483 --> 00:33:57,480
No idea.

379
00:33:58,553 --> 00:34:00,052
It's, uh...

380
00:34:00,052 --> 00:34:01,550
It's one of the first things
I ever carved.

381
00:34:04,824 --> 00:34:05,719
Lost it years ago.

382
00:34:07,622 --> 00:34:10,625
Speaking of things
carved out of wood...

383
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:14,734
Can you...

384
00:34:14,734 --> 00:34:16,136
ditch this for me somewhere?

385
00:34:16,636 --> 00:34:18,202
What for?

386
00:34:18,202 --> 00:34:19,965
It's literally
his favorite thing in the world.

387
00:34:19,965 --> 00:34:21,936
Yeah, and you need to find him
a new favorite thing, my love.

388
00:34:21,936 --> 00:34:23,539
A quieter thing,

389
00:34:23,539 --> 00:34:25,373
'cause if he blows this shit
in my ear one more time,

390
00:34:25,373 --> 00:34:27,413
you are never
getting laid again.

391
00:34:27,413 --> 00:34:28,549
Okay.

392
00:34:28,549 --> 00:34:29,509
I'll hide it out here

393
00:34:29,509 --> 00:34:31,448
until he drives you nuts
asking for it.

394
00:34:31,915 --> 00:34:33,512
Thank you.

395
00:34:33,512 --> 00:34:35,485
Uh, garbage goes
out front tonight.

396
00:34:44,828 --> 00:34:46,861
<i>The score is now
two-zero in favor of Texas.</i>

397
00:34:46,861 --> 00:34:48,033
Fute.

398
00:34:48,033 --> 00:34:49,935
<i>- Anderson is trying...</i>
- Later, Jakie.

399
00:34:49,935 --> 00:34:51,899
- You can play Fute later.
- Fute.

400
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:53,470
Fute.

401
00:34:54,475 --> 00:34:55,907
Fute!

402
00:34:55,907 --> 00:34:58,738
Okay. Okay, fine, I'll get it.

403
00:34:58,738 --> 00:35:00,840
But you better play quietly,
or Mommy'll kill me.

404
00:35:02,577 --> 00:35:03,783
Hey, what do you say
when I say,

405
00:35:03,783 --> 00:35:04,679
"if you're okay in the tub?"

406
00:35:05,816 --> 00:35:06,853
Fute.

407
00:35:06,853 --> 00:35:08,850
No, no. What do you say?

408
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:10,050
"Okay."

409
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,886
Okay. All right.

410
00:35:11,886 --> 00:35:14,388
Mommy and Auntie Anna
are across the hall
if you need 'em.

411
00:35:14,388 --> 00:35:16,122
I'm going downstairs
for a sec.

412
00:35:16,122 --> 00:35:17,858
Okay.

413
00:35:17,858 --> 00:35:21,229
Sis, I'm, like, juggling
four different campaigns.

414
00:35:21,229 --> 00:35:23,233
You know, you promised me rose

415
00:35:23,233 --> 00:35:24,998
- and <i>Real Housewives.</i>
- Are you okay?

416
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:26,140
Okay!

417
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:36,810
Is that Dolly?

418
00:35:37,818 --> 00:35:39,112
You okay up there?

419
00:35:39,112 --> 00:35:40,418
Okay!

420
00:35:48,025 --> 00:35:49,022
Huh.

421
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:50,659
Dolly!

422
00:35:57,837 --> 00:35:59,565
You okay, Jake?

423
00:36:04,743 --> 00:36:05,674
Jake?

424
00:36:08,681 --> 00:36:09,678
Jake?

425
00:36:14,121 --> 00:36:16,151
What are you
supposed to say, Jake?

426
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,359
Daddy asked you
a question, Jakie.

427
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,360
Okay.

428
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,994
Did you
turn the lights off?

429
00:36:25,994 --> 00:36:27,098
Nope.

430
00:36:27,098 --> 00:36:27,927
Who are you playing with?

431
00:36:30,299 --> 00:36:32,000
Oh. There he is.

432
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,402
Dolly.

433
00:36:33,402 --> 00:36:35,041
Where'd I put it?

434
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:36,202
Who are you
playing with?

435
00:36:36,202 --> 00:36:37,541
Dolly.

436
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:02,797
The hell are you?

437
00:37:09,744 --> 00:37:11,905
Have you been
able to stop thinking
about what happened?

438
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:14,809
No.

439
00:37:17,685 --> 00:37:18,747
Have you?

440
00:37:20,082 --> 00:37:20,881
No.

441
00:38:00,389 --> 00:38:01,394

442
00:38:03,896 --> 00:38:04,793

443
00:38:05,967 --> 00:38:06,795
Need to ask you a question.

444
00:38:08,068 --> 00:38:09,266
Harvey says he spotted you

445
00:38:09,266 --> 00:38:10,769
playing by the old
service steps.

446
00:38:10,769 --> 00:38:12,298
Yeah, because...

447
00:38:12,298 --> 00:38:14,803
I was just looking
for softer wood to carve
than all this stupid oak.

448
00:38:20,314 --> 00:38:22,712
All right.
Let's you and me take a walk.

449
00:38:23,816 --> 00:38:24,813
Come on.

450
00:38:40,564 --> 00:38:41,599
You gotta be shitting me.

451
00:38:56,181 --> 00:38:57,381
<i>Your Promethian</i>

452
00:38:57,381 --> 00:38:59,078
<i>Home Security System

Come on,
you gotta be shitting me.

458
00:43:09,367 --> 00:43:10,164
Karina!

459
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:22,110
Karina, wake up!

460
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,744
Pat!

461
00:43:24,744 --> 00:43:26,779
Pat! What's going on?

462
00:43:26,779 --> 00:43:27,948
Did you see him?

463
00:43:27,948 --> 00:43:29,117
- Did you see him?
-See who?

464
00:43:29,517 --> 00:43:31,117
What?

465
00:43:31,117 --> 00:43:32,920
- Just go back inside, okay?
- No, but what...

466
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,427
Just go back inside.
Lock the door.

467
00:43:34,427 --> 00:43:35,893
- Pat, what... No! Pat!
- Just stay here.

468
00:43:39,529 --> 00:43:40,997
Where are you?

469
00:43:42,136 --> 00:43:43,164
Are you in here?

470
00:43:44,633 --> 00:43:45,870
Where are you?

471
00:43:50,373 --> 00:43:51,205
Come on.

472
00:43:53,006 --> 00:43:54,648

- Yeah.

475
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:03,952
And nobody's here.

476
00:44:03,952 --> 00:44:05,285
I swear I saw something...

477
00:44:06,259 --> 00:44:07,555
Alarm.

478
00:44:07,555 --> 00:44:08,827
One sec.

479
00:44:11,892 --> 00:44:12,992
No fingerprints

480
00:44:12,992 --> 00:44:14,797
or any of the doors
or windows,

481
00:44:14,797 --> 00:44:16,596
and none of the molds
in the backyard

482
00:44:16,596 --> 00:44:18,870
came up a match.

483
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:23,070
Power company did confirm
13 separate interruptions,

484
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:25,673
but insist the problem
is not on their end.

485
00:44:25,673 --> 00:44:26,746
Meaning what?

486
00:44:29,112 --> 00:44:32,485
You haven't had a new face
show up, have you?

487
00:44:32,485 --> 00:44:34,386
Different guy
checkin' the gas meter,

488
00:44:34,386 --> 00:44:37,083
- or fixin' a cable?
- No.

489
00:44:37,083 --> 00:44:38,692
And nothing missing
from the house?

490
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:46,931
Uh, Jake has this...

491
00:44:47,863 --> 00:44:50,832
musical instrument, um...

492
00:44:50,832 --> 00:44:53,135
a recorder
that he loves to play,

493
00:44:55,038 --> 00:44:58,074
which I might have
thrown out by mistake.

494
00:45:00,208 --> 00:45:01,680
But even if I did,
it would still be

495
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,442
in one of the garbage cans,
which it's not.

496
00:45:08,286 --> 00:45:09,283
And I...

497
00:45:12,352 --> 00:45:15,058
I could have sworn
I heard it being played.

498
00:45:16,561 --> 00:45:17,929
You know, last night.

499
00:45:43,453 --> 00:45:45,019
Hey.

500
00:45:45,019 --> 00:45:46,826
Thought I said,
"Take some time off."

501
00:45:49,662 --> 00:45:51,094
I need to show you something.

502
00:45:58,601 --> 00:46:00,938
So, what?

503
00:46:00,938 --> 00:46:03,971
There's a thousand more
like it back at the house.

504
00:46:03,971 --> 00:46:05,273
That's the only owl
I ever made.

505
00:46:08,142 --> 00:46:10,278
Do you remember
where I lost it?

506
00:46:16,349 --> 00:46:17,824
Don't tell me
you went back there?

507
00:46:20,622 --> 00:46:22,288
No.

508
00:46:22,288 --> 00:46:25,293
I found it in a trash bin
at home yesterday.

509
00:46:26,565 --> 00:46:28,133
How is that possible?

510
00:46:28,133 --> 00:46:29,231
It's not.

511
00:46:31,035 --> 00:46:33,004
Look what else
I found in Mom's garage.

512
00:46:47,048 --> 00:46:48,250
What are you saying, Patty?

513
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:51,825
You explain it. I...

514
00:46:53,553 --> 00:46:55,994
Mom always had a knack
for finding lost stuff.

515
00:46:56,661 --> 00:46:57,831
You know she did.

516
00:46:59,095 --> 00:47:00,460
Keep digging
through that house

517
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:02,902
and I guarantee you'll find
all kinds'a crazy shit.

518
00:47:08,035 --> 00:47:09,403
Maybe, in the meantime,

519
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:13,972
I think you should
give that shrink a call.

520
00:47:13,972 --> 00:47:15,343
What was her name?

521
00:47:17,349 --> 00:47:18,346
Mary?

522
00:47:18,845 --> 00:47:21,120
Barbara.

523
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,317
Yeah, something's
been bubbling up in you
for a long time now,

524
00:47:24,317 --> 00:47:26,354
and she always seemed to help
back in the day.

525
00:47:49,149 --> 00:47:51,379
Yeah, let your
brother have a go, all right?

526
00:47:52,914 --> 00:47:53,953
Not too high.

527
00:47:55,555 --> 00:47:56,417
Are you serious?

528
00:48:00,659 --> 00:48:01,760
Gotta go.

529
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,127
Push it back.
Push it back.

530
00:48:04,563 --> 00:48:05,393
Push it back.

531
00:48:10,131 --> 00:48:11,604
-Present.
- Jeez.

532
00:48:11,604 --> 00:48:13,401
- Jakie, you scared me.
- Present.

533
00:48:13,902 --> 00:48:15,538
It's from Dolly.

534
00:48:15,538 --> 00:48:16,437
What is this?

535
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:18,406
It's a present.

536
00:48:19,642 --> 00:48:20,540
Okay?

537
00:48:21,314 --> 00:48:22,344
Okay.

538
00:48:38,861 --> 00:48:39,658
What the hell?

539
00:48:54,448 --> 00:48:55,943
Shit. Jakie.

540
00:48:55,943 --> 00:48:57,016
Jakie, come out of there!

541
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,611
Jakie!

542
00:49:03,153 --> 00:49:03,950
Jakie.

543
00:49:06,956 --> 00:49:08,390
Get away from him!

544
00:49:09,224 --> 00:49:10,427
Get the hell away from my son!

545
00:49:10,427 --> 00:49:11,459
Jakie!

546
00:49:11,859 --> 00:49:13,230
Jakie!

547
00:49:15,665 --> 00:49:16,930
Jakie. Come here.

548
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:18,631
Come here. Jakie.

549
00:49:19,669 --> 00:49:20,738
Jakie!

550
00:49:51,337 --> 00:49:55,668
What's happening
to you both is very normal.

551
00:49:55,668 --> 00:50:00,307
To have your home invaded
is a traumatic experience,

552
00:50:00,307 --> 00:50:03,646
one that brings up
all kinds of issues.

553
00:50:03,646 --> 00:50:04,578
Such as?

554
00:50:05,245 --> 00:50:06,646
Such as,

555
00:50:06,646 --> 00:50:10,221
"How will I ever let my son
out of my sight again?"

556
00:50:10,885 --> 00:50:12,485
Or...

557
00:50:12,485 --> 00:50:15,688
"Did I fulfill my obligation
as a husband

558
00:50:16,631 --> 00:50:20,062
"and a father, and a man,

559
00:50:20,062 --> 00:50:21,694
"to protect
my wife and child?"

560
00:50:23,198 --> 00:50:25,971
Karina, Pat's description.

561
00:50:25,971 --> 00:50:29,006
It's quite evocative
of a persistent phobia

562
00:50:29,006 --> 00:50:31,044
your husband
struggled with as a child.

563
00:50:33,042 --> 00:50:34,176
Which, of course,

564
00:50:34,176 --> 00:50:37,479
is how Pat and I
came to know each other.

565
00:50:41,723 --> 00:50:43,555
What phobia was that?

566
00:50:43,555 --> 00:50:44,552
<i>Patrick.</i>

567
00:50:45,789 --> 00:50:46,587
<i>Patrick.</i>

568
00:50:48,389 --> 00:50:49,557
<i>Let's you and me take a walk.</i>

569
00:50:50,661 --> 00:50:51,592
Come on.

570
00:50:55,069 --> 00:50:56,564
You know, long before
we built this yard,

571
00:50:57,737 --> 00:50:59,432
this whole forest

572
00:50:59,432 --> 00:51:01,404
was basically
one big copper mine.

573
00:51:03,771 --> 00:51:05,606
Kicked out half the product
for the entire state,

574
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:08,741
before they finally
dug the sucker dry.

575
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:13,718
This was how you got down
to the main entry shaft...

576
00:51:15,285 --> 00:51:17,321
...back when it was owned
by the mining company.

577
00:51:18,452 --> 00:51:19,587
Who owns it now?

578
00:51:20,823 --> 00:51:21,622
Us?

579
00:51:29,432 --> 00:51:31,368
Now it belongs to Bagman.

580
00:51:34,943 --> 00:51:36,736
-Who's Bagman?
- Shh!

581
00:51:40,608 --> 00:51:42,608
You never know
who might be listenin'.

582
00:51:42,608 --> 00:51:44,612
I told your brother this story
last summer,

583
00:51:44,612 --> 00:51:47,052
just like your granddad did me
when I was your age

584
00:51:47,052 --> 00:51:49,151
and his granddad's
granddad before that.

585
00:51:49,151 --> 00:51:51,454
And all of them
swore it was true.

586
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:54,622
Just like
I'm swearing to you now.

587
00:51:56,564 --> 00:51:57,625
They say...

588
00:51:58,658 --> 00:52:00,562
he wanders
the world each night,

589
00:52:01,328 --> 00:52:02,428
searching for children

590
00:52:02,428 --> 00:52:04,632
to stuff in that
awful bag a' his.

591
00:52:05,799 --> 00:52:07,737
- Not just any children...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

592
00:52:07,737 --> 00:52:09,575
Let me guess.

593
00:52:09,575 --> 00:52:11,677
He wants the naughty children
that don't listen
to their parents or...

594
00:52:11,677 --> 00:52:13,575
Wrong, Patty.

595
00:52:14,848 --> 00:52:16,314
It's the good kids he wants.

596
00:52:17,347 --> 00:52:19,647
The shiny ones
and the dreamers.

597
00:52:21,154 --> 00:52:23,585
Once they catch his eye,
or grab his fancy,

598
00:52:24,519 --> 00:52:26,352
he won't rest
until he has them

599
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:29,094
slung over his bony shoulder.

600
00:52:29,094 --> 00:52:31,494
Screamin' for help
that's never gonna come.

601
00:52:36,367 --> 00:52:37,564
No, you're just trying
to scare me...

602
00:52:37,564 --> 00:52:39,002
Damn right,
I'm trying to scare you, boy.

603
00:52:39,002 --> 00:52:40,237
<i>And scared you better be!</i>

604
00:52:40,237 --> 00:52:41,502
<i>Wander too close,
he'll drag you in</i>

605
00:52:41,502 --> 00:52:43,271
<i>and make pencils
out of your fingers,</i>

606
00:52:43,271 --> 00:52:44,705
and gobble
the rest of you down!

607
00:52:47,407 --> 00:52:48,676
Are you with me, boy?

608
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:53,516
<i>Good.</i>

609
00:52:54,116 --> 00:52:55,188
Bagman?

610
00:53:21,374 --> 00:53:22,710
You drew these?

611
00:53:25,783 --> 00:53:26,714
Yep.

612
00:53:38,728 --> 00:53:40,728
That's what I meant
by a persistent phobia.

613
00:53:41,901 --> 00:53:43,632
Pat's was so intense,

614
00:53:44,665 --> 00:53:46,201
I felt it was crucial
to give him

615
00:53:46,201 --> 00:53:48,602
as much context as possible

616
00:53:48,602 --> 00:53:50,969
for the familial lore
that provoked it.

617
00:53:57,251 --> 00:54:02,286
As you can see,
the so-called Bag or Sackman,

618
00:54:02,286 --> 00:54:05,324
is a figure common
to almost every culture.

619
00:54:06,487 --> 00:54:09,228
Curiously, his methodology,

620
00:54:09,228 --> 00:54:11,759
even the phenomena
that accompany his presence,

621
00:54:12,493 --> 00:54:15,428
are remarkably consistent.

622
00:54:15,428 --> 00:54:17,695
He has the power to paralyze

623
00:54:17,695 --> 00:54:20,534
and incapacitate
parents and adults

624
00:54:20,534 --> 00:54:23,241
leaving their young ones
vulnerable.

625
00:54:23,241 --> 00:54:26,439
And he feeds off
the child's fear and anxiety.

626
00:54:26,439 --> 00:54:30,745
It sustains him, nourishes him.

627
00:54:30,745 --> 00:54:34,946
He can lure children to his lair
with toys or candy...

628
00:54:34,946 --> 00:54:38,421
And when the child
is at their most terrified,

629
00:54:38,421 --> 00:54:41,789
he steals them away
in his sack or bag.

630
00:54:42,856 --> 00:54:44,256
Are you trying
to make us feel stupid?

631
00:54:44,256 --> 00:54:45,759
On the contrary.

632
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:49,928
I never told Karina
about the Bagman, Barbara,

633
00:54:49,928 --> 00:54:52,600
and it wasn't a dream
that broke into our house.

634
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:56,173
No, but I'd suggest,
as a coping mechanism,

635
00:54:56,173 --> 00:54:58,744
you're projecting
the supernatural

636
00:54:58,744 --> 00:55:00,440
onto something...

637
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:03,610
all too painfully real.

638
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:07,016
And until you deal
with the real stuff

639
00:55:07,016 --> 00:55:08,387
bubbling up for you,

640
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:10,684
the anger,

641
00:55:10,684 --> 00:55:14,587
the feelings of vulnerability,
and violation,

642
00:55:14,587 --> 00:55:17,026
your panic attacks
and nightmares

643
00:55:17,026 --> 00:55:18,661
will only get worse.

644
00:55:19,328 --> 00:55:20,531
Okay, so,

645
00:55:21,463 --> 00:55:22,830
what do you suggest we do?

646
00:55:27,367 --> 00:55:28,500
I see her.

647
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,443
I'm the zombie.

648
00:55:32,707 --> 00:55:33,805
- Whoa! Hey, guys.
-Okay.

649
00:55:33,805 --> 00:55:35,643
So, he goes down 7:30
at the latest.

650
00:55:35,643 --> 00:55:37,442
- We read two stories...
- Two stories, yeah.

651
00:55:37,442 --> 00:55:38,983
...and then we sing
<i>Frere Jacques</i> when
he goes in the Pack 'n Play.

652
00:55:38,983 --> 00:55:40,685
Guys, check your phone.

653
00:55:40,685 --> 00:55:42,981
I just texted you
the confirmation number
for a room at the Hyatt.

654
00:55:42,981 --> 00:55:44,350
Two blocks from here,
three from the restaurant.

655
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:45,952
Already paid for.

656
00:55:45,952 --> 00:55:47,724
Dinner's one thing,
but there's no chance in hell

657
00:55:47,724 --> 00:55:49,622
we're sleeping
in a different place
than Jakie right now.

658
00:55:49,622 --> 00:55:51,357
Who said anything
about sleeping?

659
00:55:51,357 --> 00:55:53,630
Who said sleeping?

660
00:55:54,895 --> 00:55:56,131
Will you just get her
out of here, Pat?

661
00:55:56,131 --> 00:55:57,731
Who said...

662
00:55:57,731 --> 00:56:00,037
Jakie,
listen to Auntie Anna, okay?

663
00:56:00,037 --> 00:56:01,206
Call any time!

664
00:56:01,206 --> 00:56:03,638
We can be back,
five minutes tops, okay?

665
00:56:03,638 --> 00:56:05,070
Gonna play zombie.

666
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:12,880
I'm not sure
I'm up for this.

667
00:56:15,285 --> 00:56:16,455
Yeah, me neither.

668
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:23,627
Worst case, we get dinner to go
and eat on Anna's couch.

669
00:56:25,162 --> 00:56:26,728
Yep.

670
00:56:26,728 --> 00:56:28,934
Let's at least try to make it
as far as dessert,

671
00:56:28,934 --> 00:56:29,963
so she can put Jakie down.

672
00:56:37,076 --> 00:56:37,905
So, what's the verdict?

673
00:56:41,982 --> 00:56:42,910
Is your husband nuts?

674
00:56:46,678 --> 00:56:47,915
Completely fricking crackers.

675
00:56:54,155 --> 00:56:57,430
So, what actually happened
with you and Liam at the mine?

676
00:56:59,633 --> 00:57:03,095
Well, I thought I felt someone
cut off a lock of my hair.

677
00:57:05,101 --> 00:57:05,933
I, uh...

678
00:57:07,501 --> 00:57:08,700
I lost my shit

679
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:11,404
and then
we ran home screaming.

680
00:57:11,404 --> 00:57:13,575
A lock of your hair?

681
00:57:13,575 --> 00:57:16,380
Yeah. Bagman supposedly
always snips

682
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:18,110
one off the kids
that catch his fancy.

683
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:20,178
That's how it starts.

684
00:57:21,318 --> 00:57:22,147
What the hell for?

685
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:25,917
So he always knows
where to find you.

686
00:57:25,917 --> 00:57:28,120
No matter where
you try to run or hide.

687
00:57:32,364 --> 00:57:35,128
Your father was something else.

688
00:57:35,128 --> 00:57:38,302
I think in his own way
he was just trying
to protect me.

689
00:57:38,302 --> 00:57:39,967
A cautionary tale
to keep me safe.

690
00:57:44,872 --> 00:57:46,475
All I remember
was Mom was furious

691
00:57:46,475 --> 00:57:48,311
'cause every night
I was convinced

692
00:57:48,311 --> 00:57:49,581
he was tapping on my window.

693
00:57:50,545 --> 00:57:52,613
And then one night,

694
00:57:52,613 --> 00:57:54,982
the old man came in
and he said,

695
00:57:57,386 --> 00:58:00,823
"Your mum wants me to tell you
there's no such thing
as Bagman."

696
00:58:03,428 --> 00:58:04,992
But I'm afraid
I can't do that.

697
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,228
What I can do...

698
00:58:11,869 --> 00:58:14,771
is tell you a secret
he don't want you to know.

699
00:58:17,009 --> 00:58:18,905
Truth is,

700
00:58:18,905 --> 00:58:22,542
no matter how big, or fast,
or sneaky he is,

701
00:58:22,542 --> 00:58:24,011
he has weaknesses as well.

702
00:58:25,618 --> 00:58:28,521
Escape his grasp long enough,
he'll rot away.

703
00:58:30,085 --> 00:58:33,251
And he cannot lay a single,
skinny finger on you.

704
00:58:34,456 --> 00:58:35,561
Not as long...

705
00:58:37,427 --> 00:58:38,223
as you have this.

706
00:58:43,733 --> 00:58:45,297
You see,
every kid's got something

707
00:58:45,297 --> 00:58:48,035
that means more to them
than anything else
in the world.

708
00:58:49,869 --> 00:58:51,104
Something they love so much,

709
00:58:53,107 --> 00:58:55,614
it literally becomes
a piece of who they are.

710
00:58:56,578 --> 00:58:57,913
And believe you me,

711
00:58:58,712 --> 00:59:00,047
a child's love...

712
00:59:01,616 --> 00:59:03,586
can be a magical thing.

713
00:59:03,586 --> 00:59:05,822
It can turn even
the humblest object...

714
00:59:07,588 --> 00:59:08,759
into a totem...

715
00:59:09,524 --> 00:59:10,959
of great power.

716
00:59:15,062 --> 00:59:17,366
Now you keep this
close to your heart,

717
00:59:17,366 --> 00:59:19,297
and he cannot touch you.

718
00:59:24,275 --> 00:59:25,705
But lose it,

719
00:59:25,705 --> 00:59:28,075
or even worse,
throw it away...

720
00:59:38,852 --> 00:59:39,856
So, you keep ahold of it.

721
00:59:41,292 --> 00:59:42,089
No matter what.

722
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,229
And now you're concerned...

723
00:59:51,304 --> 00:59:52,264
that Fute has gone missing.

724
00:59:54,269 --> 00:59:56,642
If the one thing that can
supposedly protect Jake...

725
00:59:58,145 --> 00:59:59,139
from you-know-who...

726
01:00:00,678 --> 01:00:01,845
is the thing
that he loves the most?

727
01:00:03,607 --> 01:00:04,947
Honestly?

728
01:00:09,184 --> 01:00:11,718
Well, what I wanna
do right now is go back home

729
01:00:11,718 --> 01:00:13,120
and dig through the trash again.

730
01:00:15,155 --> 01:00:16,925
But if we go down
that thought track,

731
01:00:16,925 --> 01:00:18,895
I'm not sure we'll make it
to the other side, so...

732
01:00:25,065 --> 01:00:26,870
Did Barbara help
when you were eight?

733
01:00:28,202 --> 01:00:29,972
Wouldn't have made it
to nine without her.

734
01:00:31,576 --> 01:00:32,909
So, we have to trust her now.

735
01:00:51,895 --> 01:00:54,499
No,
I do not miss you at all.

736
01:00:54,499 --> 01:00:56,367
<i>What?</i>
Mmm-mmm.

737
01:00:56,367 --> 01:00:58,798
I have a real hot date tonight.

738
01:00:58,798 --> 01:01:00,934
<i>- Oh, yeah?</i>
- Three feet tall,

739
01:01:00,934 --> 01:01:03,603
talks gibberish
and craps his own pants.

740
01:01:03,603 --> 01:01:05,838
It is so, so sexy.

741
01:01:05,838 --> 01:01:07,207
<i>Stop it.</i>

742
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:10,182
Okay, babe, um...

743
01:01:10,182 --> 01:01:11,444
We'll see you tomorrow.

744
01:01:11,444 --> 01:01:12,511
<i>Yeah.</i>

745
01:01:12,511 --> 01:01:14,553
Yeah.

746
01:01:14,553 --> 01:01:19,018
And why don't you
make me something sweet?

747
01:01:19,018 --> 01:01:21,553
<i>Something sweet?
What do you mean?</i>

748
01:01:22,855 --> 01:01:24,023
<i>I don't know what you mean.</i>

749
01:01:24,023 --> 01:01:26,358
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

750
01:01:28,598 --> 01:01:31,002
Okay. Okay, babe.

751
01:01:31,002 --> 01:01:32,100
Yeah. Bye.

752
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:53,845
<i>Hey.</i>

753
01:02:53,845 --> 01:02:55,379
- Angelo.
<i>- Yeah?</i>

754
01:02:55,379 --> 01:02:58,588
Is there something weird
happening on this floor?

755
01:02:58,588 --> 01:03:00,719
<i>Uh, what do you mean, "weird"?</i>

756
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:02,055
I don't know.

757
01:03:02,055 --> 01:03:04,289
I'm hearing a voice
on a baby monitor.

758
01:03:04,289 --> 01:03:06,727
<i>Everything's clear
on my security cams.</i>

759
01:03:06,727 --> 01:03:07,792
<i>You want me to come up?</i>

760
01:03:07,792 --> 01:03:09,164
No, no. Um...

761
01:03:09,897 --> 01:03:11,402
I'm sure it's nothing.

762
01:03:11,402 --> 01:03:13,434
<i>Okay. Take it easy.</i>

763
01:03:13,434 --> 01:03:14,466
Yeah.

764
01:03:25,686 --> 01:03:27,886
Angelo, has there been
a power surge?

765
01:03:29,884 --> 01:03:31,516
Angelo, are you there?

766
01:03:36,561 --> 01:03:37,357
Come on.

767
01:03:39,726 --> 01:03:40,833
Shit.

768
01:04:20,938 --> 01:04:23,068
I don't know
what you want from me.

769
01:04:23,068 --> 01:04:25,306
But the cops are on their way!

770
01:04:30,550 --> 01:04:32,049
Did I mention I have a gun?

771
01:04:37,251 --> 01:04:39,419
Don't play with me,
motherfucker!

772
01:04:57,177 --> 01:04:58,174
Sarah!

773
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:01,012
Sarah, call the police!

774
01:06:28,733 --> 01:06:29,628
Stay back.

775
01:06:30,866 --> 01:06:31,663
Karina.

776
01:06:33,068 --> 01:06:35,098
Anna? Anna, are you okay?

777
01:06:35,098 --> 01:06:36,503
Are you okay?

778
01:06:38,005 --> 01:06:38,838
What happened?

779
01:06:38,838 --> 01:06:40,441
Where's Jakie?

780
01:06:42,111 --> 01:06:43,878
We got him. He's okay.

781
01:06:43,878 --> 01:06:45,710
Hey, buddy. Hey. Hey.

782
01:06:46,717 --> 01:06:47,646
There you go.

783
01:06:49,050 --> 01:06:50,582
It's okay. Thank you.

784
01:06:50,582 --> 01:06:53,551
We've got nothing
on the CCTV camera.

785
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:56,094
It was knocked out
when the power went down.

786
01:06:57,125 --> 01:06:58,690
Thank God for the doorman.

787
01:07:00,428 --> 01:07:03,029
Once the camera
on Anna's floor went dark,

788
01:07:03,029 --> 01:07:04,531
he headed straight up.

789
01:07:05,905 --> 01:07:08,037
He must have
scared the guy off.

790
01:07:08,037 --> 01:07:09,602
- Did Angelo get a look at him?
- No.

791
01:07:10,938 --> 01:07:12,403
But, Pat,

792
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:14,206
apparently
there are similarities

793
01:07:14,206 --> 01:07:16,312
to a case from four years ago.

794
01:07:18,414 --> 01:07:21,084
A girl named
Emily Greenberg went missing.

795
01:07:21,084 --> 01:07:24,186
Her dad suffered
similar symptoms to Anna's,

796
01:07:24,186 --> 01:07:28,619
temporary paralysis
and loss of speech.

797
01:07:28,619 --> 01:07:32,762
And these strange abrasions
on his face.

798
01:07:32,762 --> 01:07:34,099
He said he couldn't move.

799
01:07:34,931 --> 01:07:36,099
He had to lie there

800
01:07:36,099 --> 01:07:37,463
and watch this lunatic
stuff his daughter

801
01:07:37,463 --> 01:07:40,336
into a duffel bag
and run off with her.

802
01:07:47,475 --> 01:07:49,411
Look, we're gonna
get you somewhere safe.

803
01:07:50,244 --> 01:07:51,377
I'll post officers outside

804
01:07:51,377 --> 01:07:53,085
who'll keep watch
around the clock.

805
01:07:55,149 --> 01:07:56,514
Don't worry, Pat.

806
01:07:56,514 --> 01:07:58,321
We're gonna catch
this sick bastard.

807
01:08:06,027 --> 01:08:07,059
Thanks.

808
01:08:07,059 --> 01:08:08,331
No problem.

809
01:08:09,363 --> 01:08:10,863
This way. Right here.

810
01:08:10,863 --> 01:08:12,637
Come on.

811
01:08:12,637 --> 01:08:13,600
Watch your step, okay?

812
01:08:28,718 --> 01:08:31,319
They're trying to figure out
what paralyzed Anna,

813
01:08:31,319 --> 01:08:32,751
and the doctors
don't have a frickin' clue.

814
01:08:34,224 --> 01:08:35,787
Who cares,
as long as Anna's okay.

815
01:08:36,795 --> 01:08:38,656
She's far from okay.

816
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:40,594
All right, she refused to stay
in the hospital.

817
01:08:40,594 --> 01:08:43,428
She wouldn't even let us
turn the lights off upstairs.

818
01:08:43,428 --> 01:08:44,836
Karina had to give her
a sedative

819
01:08:44,836 --> 01:08:46,499
and get in bed with her,
you know?

820
01:08:46,499 --> 01:08:48,800
Well, she can stay here
as long as she needs to.

821
01:08:52,072 --> 01:08:52,905
Thank you.

822
01:08:52,905 --> 01:08:54,342
Please.

823
01:08:54,342 --> 01:08:56,643
We'd be insulted
if you went anywhere else.

824
01:08:59,046 --> 01:09:00,416
Come here.

825
01:09:10,357 --> 01:09:11,493
I'm sorry.

826
01:09:13,159 --> 01:09:14,397
For what?

827
01:09:16,230 --> 01:09:17,268
Protecting my son?

828
01:09:23,610 --> 01:09:24,940
Get some sleep.

829
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:26,343
I'm not going anywhere.

830
01:09:49,098 --> 01:09:50,235
'Bout time.

831
01:09:54,403 --> 01:09:55,603
What are you doing awake?

832
01:10:29,435 --> 01:10:30,440
We'll get through this.

833
01:10:32,007 --> 01:10:32,904
I promise.

834
01:10:50,592 --> 01:10:52,528
I can't believe
this is happening.

835
01:10:53,661 --> 01:10:55,828
What do we do
if he really does exist...

836
01:10:58,064 --> 01:11:00,767
and we have lost the one thing
in the whole world...

837
01:11:02,371 --> 01:11:04,309
that could keep our son safe?

838
01:11:08,474 --> 01:11:09,776
I'll make him a new one.

839
01:11:12,347 --> 01:11:13,780
No, that won't be the same.

840
01:11:16,516 --> 01:11:19,016
Hey, get some sleep, honey.

841
01:11:20,022 --> 01:11:20,820
All right?

842
01:12:00,732 --> 01:12:01,964
Jake!

843
01:12:01,964 --> 01:12:03,296
- Pat?
- Jake!

844
01:12:11,705 --> 01:12:14,711
Daddy. Daddy, help me.
Help me.

845
01:12:14,711 --> 01:12:15,776
Jake.

846
01:12:16,176 --> 01:12:16,975
Jake!

847
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:19,177
He's got the boy!

848
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:26,721
Pat? Pat?

849
01:12:33,063 --> 01:12:33,992
Help!

850
01:12:36,097 --> 01:12:36,896
Help!

851
01:12:38,036 --> 01:12:39,404
Somebody stop him!

852
01:13:10,563 --> 01:13:11,628
Stop right there!

853
01:13:11,628 --> 01:13:14,098
Daddy, help me.

854
01:13:43,970 --> 01:13:45,967
Daddy! Help me!

855
01:13:45,967 --> 01:13:46,999
Jake!

856
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:11,496
Jake!

857
01:14:14,428 --> 01:14:15,632
Daddy!

858
01:14:17,803 --> 01:14:18,965
Help.

859
01:14:20,533 --> 01:14:22,738
Daddy! Help me!

860
01:14:24,603 --> 01:14:27,479
Daddy, help me.

861
01:14:38,650 --> 01:14:39,986
Jake?

862
01:14:41,222 --> 01:14:42,021
Jake?

863
01:15:24,301 --> 01:15:26,703
Jake? Are you in here?

864
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:28,540
Jake?

865
01:15:32,977 --> 01:15:33,974
Jake?

866
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:40,945
God, please. God.

867
01:16:40,945 --> 01:16:42,108
No, no, no.

868
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:13,139
What the heck?

869
01:17:34,532 --> 01:17:36,195
<i>Daddy.</i>

870
01:17:37,497 --> 01:17:42,674
<i>Daddy.</i>

871
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:49,043
<i>Daddy, help me!</i>

872
01:18:01,389 --> 01:18:02,854
Mommy!

873
01:18:02,854 --> 01:18:04,124
Jakie?

874
01:18:05,891 --> 01:18:07,296
Oh, my God, Jake.

875
01:18:07,296 --> 01:18:09,660
Oh, my gosh. Jake!

876
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:10,529
Karina!

877
01:18:15,737 --> 01:18:17,803
Karina, what's happening?

878
01:18:17,803 --> 01:18:19,337
It's not Jake that he came for.

879
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:24,881
Show yourself,
you sick bastard!

880
01:18:27,648 --> 01:18:29,149
Show yourself!

881
01:19:35,183 --> 01:19:38,117
<i>First,
he steals a lock of your hair,</i>

882
01:19:38,117 --> 01:19:40,286
<i>so he always knows
where to find you.</i>

883
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:45,126
<i>And then he taunts you
and feeds off your fear.</i>

884
01:19:46,961 --> 01:19:48,599
<i>It's the good kids he wants.</i>

885
01:19:48,599 --> 01:19:51,429
<i>The shiny ones
and the dreamers.</i>

886
01:19:51,429 --> 01:19:54,099
<i>And once they catch his eye,
or grab his fancy,</i>

887
01:19:54,099 --> 01:19:56,033
<i>he won't rest
until he has them</i>

888
01:19:56,033 --> 01:19:58,137
<i>slung over his bony shoulder,</i>

889
01:19:58,137 --> 01:20:01,142
screamin' for help
that's never gonna come.

890
01:20:03,748 --> 01:20:06,147
Why come
for me now, huh?

891
01:20:07,012 --> 01:20:08,545
After all this time?

892
01:20:17,092 --> 01:20:19,094
Now you keep this
close to your heart,

893
01:20:19,893 --> 01:20:21,492
and he cannot touch you.

894
01:20:23,830 --> 01:20:25,062
<i>But lose it,</i>

895
01:20:25,062 --> 01:20:27,905
or even worse,
throw it away...

896
01:20:51,257 --> 01:20:54,457
The cold hard truth of it,
Patty,

897
01:20:54,457 --> 01:20:56,395
is that there are monsters
in this world.

898
01:20:57,897 --> 01:20:59,101
There is evil.

899
01:21:00,333 --> 01:21:02,368
And bad things
do happen to good people.

900
01:21:05,169 --> 01:21:06,372
Even little children.

901
01:21:41,873 --> 01:21:44,179
<i>The only thing that
gives me comfort at night...</i>

902
01:21:46,612 --> 01:21:49,446
is a belief that there's
something good out there,

903
01:21:49,446 --> 01:21:51,582
much more powerful
than all the bad stuff.

904
01:21:53,486 --> 01:21:55,421
<i>Something that loves
and watches over us.</i>

905
01:21:56,692 --> 01:21:57,555
<i>No matter what.</i>

906
01:22:18,177 --> 01:22:19,643
And you really believe that?

907
01:22:23,487 --> 01:22:24,615
I'm lookin' at the proof.

908
01:23:44,293 --> 01:23:47,434
Come on! It's me you want!

909
01:23:48,373 --> 01:23:49,370
Come on.

910
01:24:23,775 --> 01:24:25,203
Yeah, this way.

911
01:24:25,203 --> 01:24:26,572
Down here! On me! Keep going.

912
01:24:27,939 --> 01:24:29,541
<i>I don't know who's on foot.</i>

913
01:24:29,541 --> 01:24:31,374
Down by the yard,
keep a guard here.

914
01:24:31,374 --> 01:24:33,211
What is it? What is it?

915
01:24:33,211 --> 01:24:34,778
This is as far as she goes.

916
01:24:36,516 --> 01:24:38,419
Pat must have
taken a different route.

917
01:24:42,354 --> 01:24:43,589
Yo, boss, we got something.

918
01:24:45,191 --> 01:24:46,795
It's got blood on it.

919
01:24:46,795 --> 01:24:47,824
Let's fan out!

920
01:24:48,633 --> 01:24:49,700
What is that?

921
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:50,794
That's Jake's flute.

922
01:24:58,037 --> 01:24:59,276
Pat. Pat!

923
01:24:59,276 --> 01:25:00,441
Pat!

924
01:25:02,348 --> 01:25:03,345
Pat!

925
01:25:04,009 --> 01:25:05,314
Pat!

926
01:25:05,978 --> 01:25:07,918
Pat!

927
01:25:07,918 --> 01:25:09,049
You need
to step away from...

928
01:25:09,049 --> 01:25:10,451
Pat! Can you hear me?

929
01:25:11,557 --> 01:25:12,684
Pat!

930
01:25:14,954 --> 01:25:15,852
Pat!

931
01:25:16,989 --> 01:25:18,327
Pat!

932
01:25:19,090 --> 01:25:20,296
Pat!

933
01:25:41,615 --> 01:25:43,954
Mom said we could stay
as long as we need to.

934
01:25:43,954 --> 01:25:45,621
I just can't be
in this house anymore.

935
01:25:45,621 --> 01:25:46,652
Not without Pat.

936
01:25:47,353 --> 01:25:49,686
There's still hope, 'Rina.

937
01:25:49,686 --> 01:25:51,657
I mean, they haven't
even found anything yet.

938
01:25:52,731 --> 01:25:53,659
They're not going to.

939
01:25:56,198 --> 01:25:57,564
And it's not over yet, either.

940
01:25:59,705 --> 01:26:00,666
What do you mean?

941
01:26:02,835 --> 01:26:04,868
He's gonna come back for Jake.
I can just feel it.

942
01:26:08,373 --> 01:26:09,675
What are you gonna do?

943
01:26:13,917 --> 01:26:14,845
Whatever it takes.

944
01:26:19,119 --> 01:26:20,290
Okay. Come here.

945
01:26:29,563 --> 01:26:33,129
Just call me
when you get there. Okay?

946
01:26:33,129 --> 01:26:34,700
Yep. Yep.

947
01:26:35,606 --> 01:26:36,636
Yep.

948
01:26:39,610 --> 01:26:40,706
Yeah.

949
01:27:12,771 --> 01:27:14,740
Hey, so I got some
good news for you, pal.

950
01:27:16,309 --> 01:27:17,347
Look what Daddy found.

951
01:27:18,011 --> 01:27:18,909
Fute.

952
01:27:23,914 --> 01:27:26,785
You know, he gave everything
to get that back for you.

953
01:27:31,863 --> 01:27:33,759
And, um... And Daddy...

954
01:27:34,294 --> 01:27:35,594
He also told me a secret

955
01:27:35,594 --> 01:27:36,894
that he really,
really wants you to know.

956
01:27:40,469 --> 01:27:42,306
Okay, so how much
do you love Fute, Jakie?

957
01:27:43,704 --> 01:27:46,277
Yeah. So a child's love
is a magical thing.

958
01:27:49,376 --> 01:27:50,380
Keep it close to your heart.

959
01:27:53,217 --> 01:27:54,318
And it will always
protect you.

960
01:27:56,150 --> 01:27:57,618
- Okay?
- Okay.

961
01:27:58,183 --> 01:27:58,982
Okay.

962
01:28:00,251 --> 01:28:01,556
Always.

963
01:28:02,088 --> 01:28:03,294
Always.
