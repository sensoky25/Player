SPECIAL DELIVERY

19
00:02:27,622 --> 00:02:31,597
You should’ve called
a regular cab, not here.

20
00:02:34,463 --> 00:02:37,978
Maybe you did call the right place.
What’s your destination?

21
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,984
Well, it’s a ‘special delivery’.

22
00:02:44,014 --> 00:02:47,571
We transport anything
that regular post carriers can’t.

23
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:50,896
We’ll deliver anything
in anyway we can.

24
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,075
Holy cow!

25
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,077
A 940?

26
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:10,248
Fix it up.

27
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:13,000
Wow!

28
00:03:15,253 --> 00:03:18,173
Did you catch a lot today?
- Not much today.

29
00:03:26,722 --> 00:03:27,933
Surprise situations?

30
00:03:28,892 --> 00:03:32,687
We only deliver.
You’re in charge of the rest.

31
00:03:33,145 --> 00:03:37,121
But while on the job,
we’ll do what it takes to deliver.

32
00:03:37,149 --> 00:03:38,652
Don’t worry.

33
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,084
Yes.

34
00:03:41,113 --> 00:03:43,043
My beer!
Boss! Not again!

35
00:03:43,073 --> 00:03:44,712
Shh!
Of course.

36
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,339
Stop drinking my beer!
- Send me the client’s picture.

37
00:03:47,369 --> 00:03:50,539
Our driver will give more details.
Thanks for calling.

38
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:55,014
No drunk driving!
- I have a date tonight.

39
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:57,628
Can you drive for me, boss?

40
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,030
What date?

41
00:04:11,058 --> 00:04:13,699
You don’t have any friends.

42
00:04:13,728 --> 00:04:16,647
Chief Jang.
Do a special delivery later.

43
00:04:17,481 --> 00:04:20,080
Only with 15% overtime pay.
- 5%.

44
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,193
15%.

45
00:04:22,237 --> 00:04:23,195
Deal!

00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:26,460
TOP HOTEL 9:00
TO DAESONG PORT 9:30

47
00:04:34,498 --> 00:04:35,750
Let’s run!

48
00:04:38,253 --> 00:04:40,630
6162.
- Boss! That’s it!

49
00:04:43,758 --> 00:04:46,385
What?
- Open the door!

50
00:04:51,766 --> 00:04:53,351
Why keep the door locked!

51
00:04:54,644 --> 00:04:55,699
What? A girl?

52
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:57,688
A girl?
- What?

53
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:00,830
It’s a girl!

54
00:05:00,859 --> 00:05:02,818
You idiot!
- Sorry, boss.

55
00:05:03,527 --> 00:05:05,655
Think the chick can do the job?

56
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,618
If we don’t leave now,
you’ll miss the ship, boss.

57
00:05:10,869 --> 00:05:12,078
Damn it!

58
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:18,793
Isn’t that Jong-tae’s men?

59
00:05:19,377 --> 00:05:21,976
If you fail, you’re dead.

60
00:05:22,005 --> 00:05:24,256
Seatbelts, please.
- I’m wearing it.

61
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:31,014
It’ll be $60 extra
for the no seatbelt fine.

62
00:05:42,536 --> 00:05:43,539
Watch it!

63
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:50,909
Seatbelts!

64
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,546
Okay!

65
00:06:28,917 --> 00:06:29,945
Okay!

66
00:06:30,802 --> 00:06:31,795
You’re good.

67
00:06:46,934 --> 00:06:48,020
DAESONG PORT

68
00:06:56,515 --> 00:06:58,809
Pull over now!

69
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:00,240
Shut up!

70
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:03,023
Stop the car now!

71
00:07:22,334 --> 00:07:23,460
Floor it!

72
00:09:35,633 --> 00:09:38,052
You can’t go in there!
No way! Stop!

73
00:09:39,554 --> 00:09:42,681
It won’t fit!

74
00:10:13,087 --> 00:10:14,713
Now what!

75
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,895
Perfect! Right on time.

76
00:11:13,565 --> 00:11:14,481
Hey!

77
00:11:15,817 --> 00:11:17,652
You’re damn good.

78
00:11:24,491 --> 00:11:26,340
Send me your resumé.

79
00:11:26,369 --> 00:11:27,996
What is this, my tip?

80
00:11:28,872 --> 00:11:30,469
It’s not a tip.

81
00:11:30,497 --> 00:11:32,082
It’s an offer.

82
00:11:33,585 --> 00:11:36,671
Look.
How about working for me?

83
00:11:37,171 --> 00:11:41,146
Apart from selling liquor,
I never asked a girl to work for me.

84
00:11:41,175 --> 00:11:43,678
Think of it as an honor.

85
00:11:46,651 --> 00:11:47,648
Here.

86
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:49,267
Thank you.

87
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,865
No offer needed.

88
00:11:53,396 --> 00:11:55,690
Hey! Who’s your boss!

89
00:11:57,775 --> 00:12:00,320
Asif?
Bring me some coffee!

90
00:12:08,243 --> 00:12:10,537
Chief Jang.

91
00:12:11,205 --> 00:12:15,555
I should raise your salary
from 60:40 someday.

92
00:12:15,585 --> 00:12:17,975
How about 50:50 from tomorrow?

93
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:20,769
I wish I could,
but reality says I can’t.

94
00:12:20,798 --> 00:12:21,770
Boss?

95
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:24,899
Don’t just wish, why not just do it?

96
00:12:24,928 --> 00:12:26,275
Hey!

97
00:12:26,304 --> 00:12:30,279
50:50 means we’re partners.

98
00:12:30,308 --> 00:12:33,991
Then I can’t call you
Chief Jang anymore.

99
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,827
It’d be CEO Jang, ma’am!

100
00:12:36,855 --> 00:12:40,275
And the 60% isn’t all for me.

101
00:12:40,944 --> 00:12:44,293
I pay for rent and such
for the business.

102
00:12:44,322 --> 00:12:46,878
If it’s not going to be 50:50,
don’t bring it up again.

103
00:12:46,908 --> 00:12:50,590
I didn’t even take a puff!
- You never listen to the doctor.

104
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,039
Live long, boss.
You’re my meal ticket.

105
00:12:54,624 --> 00:12:57,681
How about a barbecue instead?
Let’s have beef!

106
00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:00,434
Short ribs? Sirloin?

107
00:13:00,463 --> 00:13:02,548
Your call!
- Yay!

108
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:09,526
Sometimes they don’t eat beef
and sometimes it’s pork.

109
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,903
What do they eat?

110
00:13:11,933 --> 00:13:14,406
Who said we don’t eat beef?

111
00:13:14,434 --> 00:13:17,617
Indians don’t eat beef.
He’s Pakistani.

112
00:13:17,647 --> 00:13:19,536
He’s Bangladeshi.

113
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:22,122
Muslims don’t eat pork.

114
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:23,623
Beef is not that expensive.

115
00:13:23,653 --> 00:13:26,793
You boys always confuse me.

116
00:13:26,823 --> 00:13:28,740
If you eat curry, you’re all Indian!

117
00:13:30,368 --> 00:13:31,828
That’s Eun-ha’s!

118
00:13:32,452 --> 00:13:34,969
Who? Chief Jang?
- Yup.

119
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:38,664
The high and mighty lady
who can drive?

120
00:13:38,917 --> 00:13:41,421
Chief Jang who likes to eat alone?

121
00:13:43,006 --> 00:13:44,186
Did she go home?

122
00:13:44,214 --> 00:13:47,481
Why do you care so much?
You’re not family.

123
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,096
Don’t even think about dating!

124
00:13:51,346 --> 00:13:53,433
Don’t eat it! I’ll eat it all!

125
00:13:56,643 --> 00:14:00,285
As the Korean Baseball League
is on record to reach 8 million viewers,

126
00:14:00,314 --> 00:14:02,746
a case casts a cloud over
the success.

127
00:14:02,774 --> 00:14:05,457
Pitcher Lee Do- young
of the Dragons,

128
00:14:05,485 --> 00:14:10,004
held a press conference today
to blow the whistle on match fixing.

129
00:14:10,033 --> 00:14:11,714
Where is it?

130
00:14:11,743 --> 00:14:13,840
The police is investigating
a broker

131
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:17,469
and an illegal sports gambling site
for match fixing.

132
00:14:17,497 --> 00:14:20,347
Here is Lee Do- young’s
press conference.

133
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,057
A walk or 1 point loss per inning

134
00:14:22,085 --> 00:14:25,728
are not difficult,
so I got $2000 to $5000 each.

135
00:14:25,757 --> 00:14:30,107
If I gave up many points
and crucial plays to lose,

136
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:33,765
I got over $10.000
or luxury brand watches and clothes.

137
00:14:36,099 --> 00:14:39,157
Dad! You’re on TV!
- What?

138
00:14:39,187 --> 00:14:42,077
The former baseball player
who Lee pointed out as a broker,

139
00:14:42,105 --> 00:14:47,082
is Kim Du-shik, who retired early
and appeared on various TV shows.

140
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:52,129
As the gambling site has been
successful despite Kim’s bold actions,

141
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:55,285
police suspect his close ties
with public officials.

142
00:14:56,204 --> 00:14:59,386
Why’d they use
a picture like that?

143
00:14:59,414 --> 00:15:01,876
There are lots of
good pictures of me, right?

144
00:15:04,087 --> 00:15:05,171
Stop doing that!

145
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:09,092
Kim Seo-won! Done packing?

146
00:15:10,051 --> 00:15:12,399
You didn’t pack at all!

147
00:15:12,427 --> 00:15:13,805
Hurry up!

148
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,872
Family.

149
00:15:26,901 --> 00:15:28,331
Lyric.

150
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:29,916
Ricotta.

151
00:15:29,957 --> 00:15:32,728
Ta? Taboo.

152
00:15:32,739 --> 00:15:33,796
Boohoo.

153
00:15:33,825 --> 00:15:37,966
Hoo? Hoopy.

154
00:15:37,995 --> 00:15:40,038
I don’t think that’s a word.

155
00:15:40,498 --> 00:15:42,208
Why!

156
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,223
I enjoyed another meal today.

157
00:15:45,253 --> 00:15:48,226
Like and subscribe! Come on!

158
00:15:48,256 --> 00:15:50,842
See you all tomorrow! Bye!

159
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:57,777
Why don’t more bastards
subscribe to my damn channel?

160
00:15:57,807 --> 00:16:01,686
Quiet down when I’m on live,
you damn pigs!

161
00:16:02,687 --> 00:16:04,118
Nihao.

162
00:16:04,147 --> 00:16:06,524
Here’s the money.
Here.

163
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:14,336
Okay!

164
00:16:14,364 --> 00:16:17,464
By the way,
what about the ship?

165
00:16:17,492 --> 00:16:20,787
9:00 p.m. tomorrow. Pyeongtaek Port.
- Pyeongtaek Port at 9:00 p.m.?

166
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:24,429
The deal is done.

167
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:27,599
Do you have a ride?
- My car is outside.

168
00:16:27,627 --> 00:16:29,921
What? You’re driving there?

169
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:32,717
Then, take a taxi?

170
00:16:33,216 --> 00:16:34,898
A taxi? Shit!

171
00:16:34,926 --> 00:16:36,636
You’re unbelievable!

172
00:16:37,722 --> 00:16:43,031
90% of those trying to smuggle out
get caught before they reach the ship.

173
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,407
Really? What do I do?

174
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:49,788
There’s a special way that guarantees
you reach your destination.

175
00:16:49,816 --> 00:16:52,445
I recommend it.
- How much?

176
00:16:53,653 --> 00:16:57,504
$10.000 each. No discounts.

177
00:16:57,532 --> 00:16:58,797
$20.000.

178
00:16:58,825 --> 00:17:01,592
Want me to set you up or not?

179
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:02,954
I’ll take it.

180
00:17:03,915 --> 00:17:06,012
Awesome! Come on!

181
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:08,085
Bring me my phone.

182
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:12,381
Shit!

183
00:17:19,889 --> 00:17:21,349
Who are you people?

184
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:26,825
I’m Jesus. He’s Moses.

185
00:17:26,853 --> 00:17:28,563
Split apart.

186
00:17:31,943 --> 00:17:34,111
Try it again.

187
00:17:34,612 --> 00:17:35,821
What the?

188
00:17:36,988 --> 00:17:37,949
Boss?

189
00:17:40,785 --> 00:17:42,132
What brings you here?

190
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,175
It’s my first time
in this new office.

191
00:17:44,205 --> 00:17:47,208
Yes.
- You went on vacation?

192
00:17:47,999 --> 00:17:53,171
Everyone takes their kids abroad
on English camps these days, sir.

193
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,480
An English camp for kids in Macao?

194
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,221
I had to transfer there, sir.

195
00:18:00,887 --> 00:18:02,402
It’s your gift, boss.

196
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:04,350
Thanks.
- Anytime, sir.

197
00:18:07,144 --> 00:18:10,493
Suddenly came to collect, sir?
- Don’t you watch the news?

198
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:11,524
The news, sir?

199
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,359
Jeez.

200
00:18:14,652 --> 00:18:17,208
If I gave up many points...
- It’s Lee Do- young.

201
00:18:17,238 --> 00:18:20,587
and crucial plays to lose,
I got over $10.000.

202
00:18:20,615 --> 00:18:25,663
A walk or 1 point loss per inning
are not difficult...

203
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:32,807
I know you or Du-shik did this.

204
00:18:32,837 --> 00:18:35,935
Please, boss. It’s not me.
I swear.

205
00:18:35,965 --> 00:18:37,967
I had nothing to do with that.

206
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,178
The bank security fob is gone.

207
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:44,611
Yesterday, you ordered Kim to...

208
00:18:44,639 --> 00:18:47,934
I ordered Kim?
- To bring it, sir.

209
00:18:48,811 --> 00:18:50,104
You idiot!

210
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:54,859
How much is in our account?
- About $30 million, sir.

211
00:18:55,443 --> 00:18:57,944
Know why I made you co- CEOs?

212
00:18:58,653 --> 00:19:02,296
Because Kim was able to
win over current players and...

213
00:19:02,325 --> 00:19:03,380
No.

214
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:06,466
Because I have my MBA?
- Damn it!

215
00:19:06,536 --> 00:19:09,135
Because I don’t trust you!

216
00:19:09,165 --> 00:19:10,845
To hold each other in check!

217
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:14,182
But you thought I told Kim
to bring you the security fob?

218
00:19:14,211 --> 00:19:15,588
Stupid!

219
00:19:17,672 --> 00:19:21,231
Here. Scratch it.

220
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:22,982
If you win, I’ll believe you.

221
00:19:23,012 --> 00:19:25,902
Then you can just disappear
and go into hiding.

222
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,183
If I don’t win?

223
00:19:27,682 --> 00:19:31,020
If you don’t,
I’ll think of something.

224
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,497
Scratch it.

225
00:19:37,526 --> 00:19:38,611
Yes, sir.

226
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,877
Boss!

227
00:19:42,907 --> 00:19:44,879
I’ll take the fault, sir!

228
00:19:44,909 --> 00:19:47,006
I’ll go in and be investigated.

229
00:19:47,036 --> 00:19:49,343
I’ll do anything for you, boss!

230
00:19:49,372 --> 00:19:51,749
Please forgive me just this once?

231
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:54,348
Is it no smoking in here?

232
00:19:54,389 --> 00:19:55,527
No, sir.

233
00:20:03,677 --> 00:20:05,692
That loser has no guts.

234
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,517
At least, Kim Du-shik
is gambling with his life.

235
00:20:18,024 --> 00:20:18,984
BOSS CHO

236
00:20:21,611 --> 00:20:22,822
Don’t answer it.

237
00:20:27,201 --> 00:20:28,326
BOSS CHO

238
00:20:29,035 --> 00:20:31,956
He’s calling again!
- Don’t answer it!

239
00:20:41,631 --> 00:20:45,940
Kim Du-shik?
You answered your phone?

240
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:48,860
Sounds like you’re driving,
so I’ll be brief.

241
00:20:48,888 --> 00:20:52,447
You know the $300.000 or so
you took?

242
00:20:52,475 --> 00:20:53,824
Keep it.

243
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:56,118
It’s okay. It’s your severance pay.

244
00:20:56,147 --> 00:20:58,161
But hand over the security fob.

245
00:20:58,189 --> 00:21:02,403
Only I know the bank.
You can’t get the $30 million.

246
00:21:04,447 --> 00:21:05,865
Answer me, Kim.

247
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:07,879
Fine.

248
00:21:07,907 --> 00:21:09,547
I’ll give it back.

249
00:21:09,577 --> 00:21:12,246
When I arrive safely
far away from you.

250
00:21:13,122 --> 00:21:15,553
I’ll give it to you,
so don’t chase me, bastard!

251
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:18,598
Or else I’ll get rid of it for good!

252
00:21:18,627 --> 00:21:21,893
Are you out of your mind?

253
00:21:21,921 --> 00:21:25,230
I’ll come to you before you know it.
Just wait.

254
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:28,691
I’ll get you soon.
- Try it, you son of a bitch!

255
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:30,513
Let’s see if I lose my head
or you lose...

256
00:21:54,412 --> 00:21:57,917
Slept well? Are you hungry?

257
00:22:42,711 --> 00:22:44,338
Chubby!

258
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:48,980
My baby!

259
00:22:49,008 --> 00:22:51,512
Watch the house
till Mommy comes back.

260
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:55,391
I work hard to provide
for you, baby.

261
00:22:57,851 --> 00:22:59,782
Say, “Have a nice day, Mommy.”

262
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:03,148
Say, “Cheer up.
It’ll be another good day.”

263
00:23:05,316 --> 00:23:06,944
You silly bastard.

264
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:09,363
See you later.

265
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,080
Drive safely.

266
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:23,961
The bottom is all scratched up.

267
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:27,393
Did you fall asleep at the wheel?

268
00:23:27,423 --> 00:23:30,104
I should be the one on the road!

269
00:23:30,134 --> 00:23:31,731
Watch it.

270
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,360
Check on the front camber.
The grip sucks when I turn.

271
00:23:35,389 --> 00:23:36,390
Yes, sir!

272
00:23:36,806 --> 00:23:39,573
Chief Jang!
- Yes.

273
00:23:39,602 --> 00:23:41,352
It’s a job in Seoul.

274
00:23:41,895 --> 00:23:44,744
Pyeongtaek Port, 9:00 p.m.
Pyeongtaek Port?

275
00:23:44,773 --> 00:23:46,663
Is this job for Lim Ki-bang?

276
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:49,207
I told you not to take his gigs.
They’re messy.

277
00:23:49,235 --> 00:23:53,461
It pays a lot.
If it’s messy, just dust it off.

278
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:56,506
You know the drill.
- Just call them a cab.

279
00:23:56,534 --> 00:23:57,757
Come on!

280
00:23:57,786 --> 00:24:00,802
Why do you think they called us?
They have their reasons.

281
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,553
I couldn’t care less.

282
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:05,044
But we make a living off
those reasons.

283
00:24:06,295 --> 00:24:07,100
50:50.

284
00:24:07,129 --> 00:24:09,088
All of a sudden?
- 50:50.

285
00:24:13,927 --> 00:24:14,803
Deal.

286
00:24:15,429 --> 00:24:16,901
I’m only going to deliver.

287
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:19,487
If it’s not packaged right,
I’m coming back.

288
00:24:19,516 --> 00:24:22,311
Whatever you say, CEO Jang.

289
00:24:26,023 --> 00:24:28,566
Uijeongbu Baseball Park.
Pick up at 8:00 p.m.

290
00:24:30,653 --> 00:24:34,113
Drop off at Pyeongtaek Port.
Here’s the client plus one more.

291
00:24:48,127 --> 00:24:50,060
There’ll be one backup car
at Pyeongtaek Port.

292
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:53,271
Get your own, if you need more.
- If things go wrong?

293
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:55,426
Take public transportation
and call with a 2G phone.

294
00:25:08,731 --> 00:25:10,747
Here is the main entrance.

295
00:25:10,776 --> 00:25:13,541
This is a side entrance.
There are two more here.

296
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:16,002
The client will be here.

297
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:19,742
This is you.
Where will you meet them?

298
00:25:21,537 --> 00:25:24,969
I’ll go here. If I go on the roundabout,
it could be checkmate.

299
00:25:24,998 --> 00:25:29,766
Right. And if flies tail you,
you can go here and lose them.

300
00:25:29,795 --> 00:25:32,935
Then take the beltway.
- Okay.

301
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:35,426
What’s this blocking off
the intersection?

302
00:25:38,011 --> 00:25:40,139
That’s just my lighter.

303
00:25:55,112 --> 00:25:56,697
Stop!

304
00:26:00,909 --> 00:26:03,120
Why do you always forget things?

305
00:26:04,662 --> 00:26:06,582
Drive safely.
- Yes, sir.

306
00:26:12,086 --> 00:26:15,089
Boss?
- She forgot this, too.

307
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:17,216
Jeez...

308
00:27:04,263 --> 00:27:07,893
Just one more. The last strike!

309
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:28,037
What a naïve son of a bitch.
I’ll meet you there.

310
00:27:43,469 --> 00:27:44,775
Seo-won.

311
00:27:44,805 --> 00:27:47,945
I only won 8 games at most
in a season.

312
00:27:47,975 --> 00:27:51,533
But you can win 20
and go to the Major Leagues!

313
00:27:51,562 --> 00:27:54,857
You told me not to play baseball.
You hate it.

314
00:27:55,691 --> 00:27:57,276
Who says I hate baseball?

315
00:27:58,235 --> 00:27:59,653
Baseball hated me.

316
00:28:03,614 --> 00:28:05,242
Our ride is here!

317
00:28:17,379 --> 00:28:18,130
Shit!

318
00:28:18,755 --> 00:28:21,717
Dang. That bastard can’t even run?

319
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:27,513
Dad...

320
00:28:33,061 --> 00:28:34,187
BOSS CHO
Why is this on?

321
00:28:35,104 --> 00:28:37,482
Go to the other side.
- Hey, Du-shik!

322
00:28:39,026 --> 00:28:41,403
Why don’t you answer your phone?

323
00:28:42,404 --> 00:28:43,780
Hey, Du-shik!

324
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:48,172
Seo-won. Look at me.

325
00:28:48,201 --> 00:28:51,245
Make sure you don’t lose this.

326
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:04,217
Du-shik!

327
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:08,484
Memorize 6162.
Remember the fork by the entrance?

328
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:10,891
Find a car with plate 6162.
That’s our ride.

329
00:29:11,892 --> 00:29:13,656
I’m starving.
Let’s get this over with!

330
00:29:13,684 --> 00:29:16,826
Take my phone. If you forget,
turn it on to see then turn it off!

331
00:29:16,854 --> 00:29:19,608
Take it.
- What about you?

332
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:22,235
I’ll be right behind you.

333
00:29:24,488 --> 00:29:26,823
I’ll call you with this.
Okay?

334
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:34,719
Stop. Don’t cry.

335
00:29:34,748 --> 00:29:38,126
A man’s gotta have guts!
Got it?

336
00:29:39,001 --> 00:29:40,419
Now, go!

337
00:29:41,046 --> 00:29:42,421
Chubby!

338
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,259
Where is he?

339
00:29:47,009 --> 00:29:48,177
Chubby!

340
00:29:52,516 --> 00:29:54,183
Did you eat?

341
00:29:56,144 --> 00:29:57,562
Get lost, assholes!

342
00:29:58,522 --> 00:30:01,899
Out of my way, bastards!

343
00:30:04,318 --> 00:30:05,654
Cho Kyeong-pil!

344
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,614
Jesus!

345
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:26,550
I played baseball as a boy.
How’d it go?

346
00:30:29,218 --> 00:30:30,219
Was it like this?

347
00:30:33,432 --> 00:30:34,862
Shit!

348
00:30:34,891 --> 00:30:36,018
Foul!

349
00:30:36,893 --> 00:30:37,894
Look!

350
00:30:38,769 --> 00:30:42,203
I gave you a chance!

351
00:30:42,231 --> 00:30:45,039
To bleed bastards like you dry!

352
00:30:45,067 --> 00:30:47,375
I let you be a CEO!

353
00:30:47,404 --> 00:30:49,865
But you stabbed me in the back!

354
00:30:50,866 --> 00:30:54,578
Stabbed? Do you even feel pain?

355
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:03,336
Look Du-shik.
I’ll ask you one last time.

356
00:31:05,213 --> 00:31:06,672
Where’s the security fob?

357
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:12,304
Come on, man! Just tell me!

358
00:31:14,765 --> 00:31:15,806
Sure.

359
00:31:17,017 --> 00:31:18,226
Where is it?

360
00:31:19,728 --> 00:31:21,021
I ate it.

361
00:31:22,856 --> 00:31:24,441
What did you say?

362
00:31:25,233 --> 00:31:27,152
Cut my gut and take it.

363
00:31:35,409 --> 00:31:36,912
Fine, I will.

364
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:44,252
Hurry Dad...

365
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,393
Is it a no- show?

366
00:32:03,729 --> 00:32:05,022
Find him.

367
00:32:05,482 --> 00:32:07,441
Scatter out!

368
00:32:33,301 --> 00:32:34,760
There he is!

369
00:32:37,596 --> 00:32:39,598
Open up! Please!

370
00:32:40,057 --> 00:32:42,656
Help me!
- Kid! Come here! Stop!

371
00:32:42,686 --> 00:32:44,271
Help me, please!

372
00:32:44,938 --> 00:32:46,828
Open the door!

373
00:32:46,857 --> 00:32:47,898
Please!

374
00:32:48,774 --> 00:32:50,527
Plate 6162!

375
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,740
Stop him!

376
00:32:58,702 --> 00:32:59,870
Stop the car!

377
00:33:04,623 --> 00:33:07,209
Stop! What the hell?

378
00:33:10,005 --> 00:33:11,006
Stop!

379
00:34:35,382 --> 00:34:36,590
Damn it!

380
00:34:53,108 --> 00:34:54,442
The security fob isn’t here.

381
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,735
The kid must have it.

382
00:34:57,279 --> 00:34:59,627
As I came,
Du-shik was happy to see my car.

383
00:34:59,656 --> 00:35:01,587
He waved like this!

384
00:35:01,615 --> 00:35:03,702
He was waiting for his ride.

385
00:35:09,206 --> 00:35:10,263
Come out now.

386
00:35:10,292 --> 00:35:13,849
The bitch who took him is good.
- What?

387
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:16,089
It was a girl!

388
00:35:17,465 --> 00:35:19,341
Call Chief Woo.

389
00:35:32,147 --> 00:35:33,230
Hello, sir.

390
00:35:34,607 --> 00:35:36,192
I’m doing the laundry.

391
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:39,988
Yes, sir.

392
00:36:18,275 --> 00:36:19,611
Wait for me!

393
00:36:52,268 --> 00:36:54,521
Hey!
- I’m Kim Seo-won.

394
00:36:56,272 --> 00:36:58,108
You left this.

395
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:00,985
Stop following me and go.

396
00:37:02,404 --> 00:37:04,863
Take the subway over there.

397
00:37:05,739 --> 00:37:08,368
I have nowhere to go.
- That’s not my business.

398
00:37:09,285 --> 00:37:11,759
What if the gangsters come for me?

399
00:37:11,788 --> 00:37:15,457
Call the cops.
- Dad said not to go to the cops!

400
00:37:16,543 --> 00:37:18,891
Didn’t you come to rescue me?

401
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,894
Nope.
- But you saved me before.

402
00:37:21,923 --> 00:37:24,758
I came to make money.
- I have money!

403
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:27,303
Forget it.

404
00:37:29,471 --> 00:37:31,945
Dad said he’ll call.

405
00:37:31,975 --> 00:37:34,184
Please stay with me until then.

406
00:37:36,563 --> 00:37:39,328
Chief Jang! Explain yourself.

407
00:37:39,356 --> 00:37:42,164
It’s a delivery glitch.
- Shit.

408
00:37:42,192 --> 00:37:45,626
Are you with the client?
- Nope. Just his kid.

409
00:37:45,654 --> 00:37:47,323
This is bad.

410
00:37:48,575 --> 00:37:50,631
You can’t make a return, huh?

411
00:37:50,659 --> 00:37:52,758
I told you not to take the gig!

412
00:37:52,786 --> 00:37:55,344
Lim Ki-bang, that asshole!

413
00:37:55,372 --> 00:37:56,553
Pull out.

414
00:37:56,583 --> 00:37:59,432
I’ll cut lines with him.
Come back now.

415
00:37:59,461 --> 00:38:01,754
Got the delivery fee?
- Not yet.

416
00:38:03,797 --> 00:38:06,383
He left some money with the kid.

417
00:38:07,177 --> 00:38:11,735
You gotta get paid.
Drop him off somewhere.

418
00:38:11,764 --> 00:38:12,806
Hold on.

419
00:38:15,185 --> 00:38:16,615
Kid!

420
00:38:16,644 --> 00:38:19,606
I’m Kim Seo-won.
- Do you have a mom?

421
00:38:20,273 --> 00:38:22,120
No grandma or grandpa?

422
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,413
Nope.

423
00:38:23,443 --> 00:38:24,903
No aunts or uncles?

424
00:38:26,029 --> 00:38:28,794
Got any friends?
- Do you, ma’am?

425
00:38:28,822 --> 00:38:29,823
Lots.

426
00:38:34,536 --> 00:38:37,706
He’s got no one.
Find a place for me, boss.

427
00:38:39,792 --> 00:38:41,169
Make it quick.

428
00:38:43,671 --> 00:38:44,810
Let’s do this.

429
00:38:44,838 --> 00:38:48,939
I know a guy who deals with kids.
Leave the boy with him.

430
00:38:48,967 --> 00:38:50,929
Then the delivery is done.

431
00:39:02,731 --> 00:39:04,817
I have a dot here, too.

432
00:39:10,585 --> 00:39:12,872
Wanna play word chain?

433
00:39:13,326 --> 00:39:15,954
Word chain, please?
- Just sleep.

434
00:39:16,621 --> 00:39:17,789
Nasty.

435
00:39:19,207 --> 00:39:20,500
Nasty!

436
00:39:21,209 --> 00:39:22,932
Typical games suck.

437
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:26,310
Suck? You’re good!

438
00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:29,062
But sentences don’t count.

439
00:39:29,092 --> 00:39:30,843
It has to be a word.
- Kid!

440
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,221
I’m Kim Seo-won.

441
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:35,861
Don’t call me ma’am.

442
00:39:35,889 --> 00:39:38,600
Then what should I call you?
- Just don’t.

443
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,447
High shot!

444
00:39:52,949 --> 00:39:54,158
Sent by Mr. Baek?

445
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:02,721
Are you Se-won?

446
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,431
I’m Seo-won.

447
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:07,255
Right Se-won. Come with me.

448
00:40:14,052 --> 00:40:15,053
Want it?

449
00:40:21,436 --> 00:40:24,105
Did you starve him?
Jeez.

450
00:40:25,106 --> 00:40:26,983
Eat slowly.

451
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:32,501
How’s Mr. Baek doing?
I haven’t seen him in so long.

452
00:40:32,529 --> 00:40:34,836
What do you do?
- Why?

453
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:38,382
Think I’ll make him sell gums?
That’s illegal now.

454
00:40:38,411 --> 00:40:40,634
We do things legally to...

455
00:40:40,662 --> 00:40:42,624
You’re done already?

456
00:40:43,373 --> 00:40:44,972
Want another one?

457
00:40:45,001 --> 00:40:46,682
Here.

458
00:40:46,711 --> 00:40:48,433
Why you...

459
00:40:48,463 --> 00:40:50,936
Let’s go.
Thank the lady.

460
00:40:50,964 --> 00:40:52,257
Thank you.

461
00:40:53,926 --> 00:40:55,803
Give my regards to Mr. Baek.

462
00:40:59,389 --> 00:41:00,600
Come on.

463
00:41:07,148 --> 00:41:09,330
Finished the delivery?
- Yes.

464
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:10,902
Okay. Well done.

465
00:41:11,568 --> 00:41:15,002
Did you count the delivery fee?
- I’ll do it later.

466
00:41:15,031 --> 00:41:16,281
You didn’t yet?

467
00:41:17,158 --> 00:41:19,006
Must I do that now?

468
00:41:19,035 --> 00:41:21,717
Just in case the kid paid wrong.
Count it!

469
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:23,927
It’s more than enough!

470
00:41:23,956 --> 00:41:25,595
Don’t scream.

471
00:41:25,625 --> 00:41:30,100
You always count the delivery fee!
What’s with you today?

472
00:41:30,128 --> 00:41:32,173
Fine! I’ll count it!

473
00:42:04,706 --> 00:42:06,456
What’s he doing with him?

474
00:42:10,998 --> 00:42:11,849
What?

475
00:42:14,882 --> 00:42:16,105
Where’s the kid?

476
00:42:16,134 --> 00:42:18,399
He went into poo for so long.

477
00:42:18,428 --> 00:42:19,971
Is he constipated?

478
00:42:49,791 --> 00:42:53,086
Captain? Why the blood?
- What blood?

479
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:56,048
It’s nothing. Split apart.

480
00:42:57,341 --> 00:43:02,359
Heard Kim Du-shik’s body was found
in the fire at the baseball park?

481
00:43:02,387 --> 00:43:05,946
Yes, sir!
- Right after the fire,

482
00:43:05,974 --> 00:43:09,282
a car was seen speeding out
of the park.

483
00:43:09,312 --> 00:43:11,409
It’s an old BMW.

484
00:43:11,439 --> 00:43:13,495
This is the car
we received a tip on.

485
00:43:13,523 --> 00:43:16,498
This is from an intersection
near the ballpark before the fire.

486
00:43:16,526 --> 00:43:19,793
The license plate
is from an expired vehicle.

487
00:43:19,821 --> 00:43:22,254
It’s obviously a get- away car.

488
00:43:22,283 --> 00:43:25,215
Kim Du-shik was murdered after this.

489
00:43:25,243 --> 00:43:26,370
Next.

490
00:43:27,704 --> 00:43:30,804
See? There’s a kid inside now.

491
00:43:30,832 --> 00:43:34,337
That’s Kim Du-shik’s son,
Kim Seo-won.

492
00:43:36,214 --> 00:43:39,312
An expired car,
then Kim Du-shik was murdered.

493
00:43:39,342 --> 00:43:44,442
It means that driver with the cap
killed Kim and kidnapped his son.

494
00:43:44,472 --> 00:43:47,863
It’s 10:10 P.M. now.
It’s been two hours!

495
00:43:47,892 --> 00:43:50,073
The car could be anywhere.
- Find it.

496
00:43:50,102 --> 00:43:52,450
Scan all nearby roads and highways.

497
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,327
Find the culprit now!
- Yes, sir!

498
00:43:54,357 --> 00:43:55,483
Scatter out!

499
00:44:03,573 --> 00:44:04,713
Sir?
- What?

500
00:44:04,741 --> 00:44:06,702
Is it okay to investigate publicly?

501
00:44:07,245 --> 00:44:08,745
Sang-hoon.

502
00:44:09,579 --> 00:44:13,430
We’re not talking about $3000
but $30 million!

503
00:44:13,458 --> 00:44:16,099
You can make $3000
if you work hard.

504
00:44:16,128 --> 00:44:17,922
But $30 million?

505
00:44:18,673 --> 00:44:22,759
You gotta put your life on the line.

506
00:44:43,488 --> 00:44:45,992
RETURN KEYS HERE

507
00:44:50,495 --> 00:44:52,874
Are you leaving me again?

508
00:44:53,416 --> 00:44:55,500
No, I’m going to buy something.

509
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:04,385
Trust me now?

510
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:13,686
Ma’am?

511
00:45:15,228 --> 00:45:18,231
Why is it so hard to live?

512
00:45:19,734 --> 00:45:22,320
What do you mean?

513
00:45:29,577 --> 00:45:30,745
I’m hungry.

514
00:45:32,829 --> 00:45:34,457
Of course you are.

515
00:45:38,376 --> 00:45:41,546
Express how it tastes. How is it?

516
00:45:42,882 --> 00:45:45,426
It’s warm.

517
00:45:46,134 --> 00:45:47,552
That’s not it, stupid!

518
00:45:48,012 --> 00:45:49,889
You try it.

519
00:45:50,847 --> 00:45:52,112
Excuse me.

520
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:54,810
May I ask
who is Mr. Lim Ki-bang?

521
00:45:57,605 --> 00:45:58,731
What is it?

522
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:02,193
Who the hell are you?

523
00:46:40,231 --> 00:46:41,482
That’s enough.

524
00:46:43,275 --> 00:46:44,831
Stop it!

525
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:48,460
How can he talk
if you make him like this?

526
00:46:48,489 --> 00:46:50,420
You’re extreme.

527
00:46:50,448 --> 00:46:52,243
No going halfway.

528
00:46:56,789 --> 00:46:57,999
Who are you?

529
00:47:00,084 --> 00:47:01,765
He can talk, sir.

530
00:47:01,794 --> 00:47:03,920
That son of a bitch.

531
00:47:05,046 --> 00:47:07,133
Chief Jang? Call me.

532
00:47:08,277 --> 00:47:10,947
You bitch! Are you nuts?

533
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:13,305
Why are you going AWOL?

534
00:47:13,848 --> 00:47:17,572
Do you have flies on your tail?

535
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:21,618
If you come with luggage
and they find us, we’re dead!

536
00:47:21,646 --> 00:47:24,245
Got it?
Chief Jang.

537
00:47:24,275 --> 00:47:27,652
I’ll forgive you. Come back, please?

538
00:47:33,993 --> 00:47:36,786
I’ll come after I give him this.

539
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:47,352
Let’s get to the point.

540
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:49,382
You’re the ones
who picked ‘em up, right?

541
00:47:52,136 --> 00:47:53,179
No, sir.

542
00:47:53,763 --> 00:47:56,445
I just got ‘em the passports
and the ship.

543
00:47:56,474 --> 00:47:58,225
It’s called special delivery.

544
00:47:59,602 --> 00:48:03,271
It’s a professional delivery service.
- Delivery service?

545
00:48:03,731 --> 00:48:05,775
Yes.
- Where are they?

546
00:48:06,442 --> 00:48:10,125
They just give me a number
for each pickup.

547
00:48:10,154 --> 00:48:13,002
I called when they were late
for the ship, but no one answered.

548
00:48:13,032 --> 00:48:17,715
You mean you have nothing much
to tell me?

549
00:48:17,745 --> 00:48:20,705
Stop it! It hurts!

550
00:48:21,749 --> 00:48:24,222
The car!
- What about it?

551
00:48:24,251 --> 00:48:27,934
They carry many plates around
when they’re on the job.

552
00:48:27,963 --> 00:48:32,188
When they get caught, they switch
the plates and take different cars.

553
00:48:32,218 --> 00:48:34,470
That’s how they get away.

554
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:43,075
Stop everything and check on
car theft reports.

555
00:48:43,104 --> 00:48:46,398
Then check footages of the culprit
where the cars were stolen.

556
00:48:49,485 --> 00:48:52,737
Why’d you hit him so badly?

557
00:48:53,364 --> 00:48:55,783
Go to the hospital now.

558
00:48:56,157 --> 00:48:58,576
Don’t worry, bastards.

559
00:48:59,327 --> 00:49:01,259
What did you say?

560
00:49:01,288 --> 00:49:05,960
Go to the hospital.
Learn the definition of halfway.

561
00:49:30,066 --> 00:49:31,748
Found her at a Mega Mart.

562
00:49:31,776 --> 00:49:35,127
We’re combing through CCTV files.
Should we locate her and go?

563
00:49:35,156 --> 00:49:37,253
Yes, of course.

564
00:49:37,283 --> 00:49:40,703
But she’s a pro. Be careful.

565
00:49:44,152 --> 00:49:45,653
The body was found

566
00:49:45,666 --> 00:49:50,767
to be Kim Du-shik, who is wanted
for his role in match fixing.

567
00:49:50,795 --> 00:49:54,354
Burned with signs of assault,

568
00:49:54,382 --> 00:49:59,568
an autopsy is scheduled
for the exact cause of death.

569
00:49:59,597 --> 00:50:02,390
Kim Du-shik, the suspect, has...

570
00:50:05,186 --> 00:50:07,021
My dad is dead.

571
00:50:10,482 --> 00:50:11,984
A woman who came with a boy.

572
00:50:13,526 --> 00:50:14,778
Where are they?

573
00:50:16,237 --> 00:50:17,655
Room 809.

574
00:50:45,517 --> 00:50:46,531
Freeze!

575
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:48,950
Where are they?

576
00:50:48,978 --> 00:50:51,774
They’re not here.
The bathroom’s empty.

577
00:51:00,658 --> 00:51:02,158
They’re in another room!

578
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:06,287
Stop crying!

579
00:51:07,539 --> 00:51:09,638
Kim Seo-won!
Stop crying!

580
00:51:09,667 --> 00:51:12,724
If you don’t wanna die, stop!

581
00:51:12,753 --> 00:51:13,837
Okay?

582
00:51:14,797 --> 00:51:15,756
Let’s go.

583
00:51:16,589 --> 00:51:19,231
Police! Open up!

584
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:20,386
What the hell?

585
00:52:13,022 --> 00:52:15,691
Almost missed it. Excuse me.

586
00:52:36,085 --> 00:52:39,423
Let’s say you delivered this to me.
Go home.

587
00:52:43,092 --> 00:52:45,429
Didn’t get paid? Then I’ll pay.

588
00:52:48,223 --> 00:52:50,225
It’ll be hard on a cop’s salary.

589
00:52:51,935 --> 00:52:55,731
Good eye.
Too good to just deliver.

590
00:53:05,783 --> 00:53:09,758
His dad took something of mine.

591
00:53:09,787 --> 00:53:12,468
The kid took it by mistake.

592
00:53:12,498 --> 00:53:15,167
I just want what’s mine.

593
00:53:15,751 --> 00:53:16,931
Then what?

594
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,892
I’m still working on that.

595
00:53:19,922 --> 00:53:24,856
But still! He saw me kill his
dad and that means trouble.

596
00:53:24,885 --> 00:53:27,971
Kid? Do you remember me?

597
00:53:37,898 --> 00:53:38,982
Know how to shoot?

598
00:53:43,695 --> 00:53:44,696
Shit.

599
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:55,873
Kid! I’ll come for you soon!
Wait for it!

600
00:54:20,399 --> 00:54:24,153
Is this what he’s looking for?

601
00:54:25,069 --> 00:54:27,780
If I give it do him,
will he stop coming?

602
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:16,163
Wow!

603
00:55:18,122 --> 00:55:22,306
Okay, I hear you.
Calm down. Jeez.

604
00:55:22,336 --> 00:55:23,766
Just a bit more...

605
00:55:23,795 --> 00:55:25,172
Are you okay to talk?

606
00:55:25,881 --> 00:55:27,854
Yes, go on.

607
00:55:27,883 --> 00:55:29,772
What about the police?

608
00:55:29,801 --> 00:55:32,817
They want info on a murder suspect
who is a North Korean defector.

609
00:55:32,845 --> 00:55:34,819
The commissioner wants you
on the job, ma’am.

610
00:55:34,847 --> 00:55:37,392
Damn it!

611
00:55:37,893 --> 00:55:40,909
I should never drive!

612
00:55:40,938 --> 00:55:42,397
What defector?

613
00:55:47,694 --> 00:55:50,502
Got the fingerprint ID?
What took so long?

614
00:55:50,531 --> 00:55:53,588
Her prints weren’t in
in the criminals’ databases.

615
00:55:53,617 --> 00:55:56,424
She was never caught once?

616
00:55:56,452 --> 00:55:59,928
Who is she?
- Name, Jang Eun-ha. Age 28.

617
00:55:59,957 --> 00:56:03,472
No family. No criminal history.
- Born in...

618
00:56:03,502 --> 00:56:06,964
South Pyongan Province?
She’s a North Korean defector.

619
00:56:07,923 --> 00:56:10,271
That’s why she’s so feisty!

620
00:56:10,299 --> 00:56:13,428
Current address?
- Residence unknown.

621
00:56:17,432 --> 00:56:20,768
So, all we fished out
is that she’s a commie?

622
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,619
Maybe you were fishing
in the wrong place.

623
00:56:24,648 --> 00:56:26,774
Hello.
Hi.

624
00:56:27,109 --> 00:56:28,192
Who?

625
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:30,194
HAN MI-YOUNG

626
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:33,836
Not busy these days? No spies?

627
00:56:33,865 --> 00:56:36,464
Why would NIS agents come here?

628
00:56:36,492 --> 00:56:38,466
We’re busy.

629
00:56:38,494 --> 00:56:41,385
But this case is a headache for us.

630
00:56:41,415 --> 00:56:46,140
If people say
we didn’t manage defectors well,

631
00:56:46,169 --> 00:56:47,767
then it’ll be a bigger headache.

632
00:56:47,795 --> 00:56:52,508
If you filtered out commie offenders,
this wouldn’t have happened.

633
00:56:54,802 --> 00:56:56,179
Right.

634
00:56:56,763 --> 00:57:01,393
So we came to make right
and help you arrest the culprit.

635
00:57:02,311 --> 00:57:03,575
Jang Eun-ha.

636
00:57:03,604 --> 00:57:05,981
I’m the one who first reviewed her.

637
00:57:06,982 --> 00:57:08,746
She’s something.

638
00:57:08,775 --> 00:57:12,875
She’s the only one of her family
who survived escaping North Korea.

639
00:57:12,904 --> 00:57:14,460
Let’s see.

640
00:57:14,489 --> 00:57:17,297
Murder, kidnapping...

641
00:57:17,326 --> 00:57:18,839
What a headache.

642
00:57:18,869 --> 00:57:21,288
Get to the point, please?

643
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:28,600
You have no idea
how to find Jang Eun-ha, right?

644
00:57:28,629 --> 00:57:31,894
We’ll light the way for you.

645
00:57:31,923 --> 00:57:35,802
All you have to do
is follow it and catch her.

646
00:57:38,262 --> 00:57:40,057
How will you help us?

647
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:50,067
The police?

648
00:57:50,942 --> 00:57:53,833
If the boss finds out
they’re on your tail, you’re dead!

649
00:57:53,861 --> 00:57:58,909
I don’t care if he does or not.

650
00:57:59,867 --> 00:58:03,426
Asif. Memorize this number. 0118.

651
00:58:03,455 --> 00:58:05,332
0118? What’s that?

652
00:58:06,208 --> 00:58:07,680
My door code.

653
00:58:07,708 --> 00:58:13,436
Aren’t we moving a bit too fast?

654
00:58:13,465 --> 00:58:17,023
Chubby! Go and feed him for me.

655
00:58:17,052 --> 00:58:18,804
Bye.
- Okay.

656
00:58:31,066 --> 00:58:32,192
Not bad.

657
00:58:33,235 --> 00:58:35,152
Who’s Chubby?

658
00:58:40,951 --> 00:58:44,036
Is it your cat?
- Yup.

659
00:58:45,497 --> 00:58:48,375
You live with a cat?
- Yup.

660
00:58:49,458 --> 00:58:50,669
Isn’t it cute?

661
00:58:53,255 --> 00:58:54,810
It looks mean.

662
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:58,427
No way! It’s pretty. Look closely!

663
00:59:03,682 --> 00:59:05,517
I want to go to my mom.

664
00:59:07,643 --> 00:59:09,896
Please take me to her.

665
00:59:10,814 --> 00:59:12,453
You said you don’t have one.

666
00:59:12,481 --> 00:59:16,611
Dad said I didn’t, but I do.

667
00:59:18,362 --> 00:59:19,865
Do you know where she is?

668
00:59:23,535 --> 00:59:24,995
So many...

669
00:59:26,037 --> 00:59:28,344
How do you know
your mom’s number is here?

670
00:59:28,372 --> 00:59:30,722
I called all of them.

671
00:59:30,751 --> 00:59:33,224
Then someone said she’s your mom?

672
00:59:33,253 --> 00:59:37,103
No.
One of them didn’t say anything.

673
00:59:37,132 --> 00:59:39,216
She just cried.

674
00:59:49,497 --> 00:59:52,667
Get all the phone numbers on
the mobile station around Mega Mart.

675
00:59:52,688 --> 00:59:54,620
Okay.
- How can we check all that?

676
00:59:54,649 --> 00:59:58,570
Why check it all? Only a few
of them would use 2G phones.

677
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:02,795
Hello? Is this Ms. Park Ji-sun?

678
01:00:02,823 --> 01:00:07,788
This is Cupid Flower,
a 24- hour flower delivery service.

679
01:00:09,581 --> 01:00:10,719
Found her.

680
01:00:10,749 --> 01:00:14,251
She just left Seoul Toll Gate
and is headed south.

681
01:00:14,669 --> 01:00:17,101
We can narrow it down
to a 500- meter radius.

682
01:00:17,129 --> 01:00:20,437
We’ll send updates on her locations!
Captain Cho?

683
01:00:20,467 --> 01:00:21,605
Yes?

684
01:00:21,635 --> 01:00:23,512
Call me when you find her.

685
01:00:24,763 --> 01:00:25,889
Yes, ma’am!

686
01:00:29,893 --> 01:00:33,270
Found her. End it before
the NIS agents come.

687
01:00:34,898 --> 01:00:38,652
You’ve arrived at your destination.

688
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,205
Are you okay?

689
01:01:12,561 --> 01:01:15,814
I’ll bring your mom, so stay put.
- Wait.

690
01:01:27,158 --> 01:01:28,672
You can have this.

691
01:01:28,702 --> 01:01:31,872
With this on,
you won’t lose it again.

692
01:01:35,584 --> 01:01:37,168
Don’t open the door.

693
01:02:02,027 --> 01:02:03,069
Sorry.

694
01:02:24,466 --> 01:02:27,815
While I lived with Du-shik,
I got pregnant.

695
01:02:27,843 --> 01:02:30,305
But I had a miscarriage early on.

696
01:02:31,138 --> 01:02:32,653
Last year,

697
01:02:32,681 --> 01:02:37,825
a kid called from Du-shik’s number.

698
01:02:37,853 --> 01:02:41,565
I suddenly got sentimental
and cried.

699
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:45,236
He got the wrong idea.

700
01:02:46,403 --> 01:02:49,324
So, you’re really not
Seo-won’s mom?

701
01:02:50,784 --> 01:02:51,970
No way!

702
01:02:52,535 --> 01:02:54,371
How many times did I say it?

703
01:03:11,638 --> 01:03:13,152
Poor Seo-won.

704
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:15,266
He has no one else to go to.

705
01:03:16,393 --> 01:03:20,063
By the way, how could you
think of taking him to his mom?

706
01:03:20,939 --> 01:03:24,150
Du-shik’s killers
are looking for him.

707
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:28,989
Then who would they seek out?

708
01:03:30,365 --> 01:03:31,866
His mom, of course.

709
01:03:36,246 --> 01:03:38,790
The kid must’ve grown a lot.

710
01:03:40,624 --> 01:03:42,042
Is he a good boy?

711
01:03:44,044 --> 01:03:45,547
Don’t be curious.

712
01:04:54,866 --> 01:04:57,993
I told you to wait in the car!
I’m sorry.

713
01:04:59,995 --> 01:05:01,623
It’s okay. Let’s go.

714
01:05:02,289 --> 01:05:03,707
What about Mom?

715
01:05:05,417 --> 01:05:07,504
She’s not your mom.
You were wrong.

716
01:05:12,342 --> 01:05:13,425
You’re lying!

717
01:05:20,809 --> 01:05:22,477
I’ll ask her myself.

718
01:05:35,365 --> 01:05:37,045
Why’d you break it!

719
01:05:37,075 --> 01:05:39,661
How can you break it!

720
01:05:40,078 --> 01:05:42,718
You’re right. She’s your mom!

721
01:05:42,746 --> 01:05:44,928
But she doesn’t want to see you!

722
01:05:44,958 --> 01:05:46,793
She doesn’t want to be your mom!

723
01:05:48,378 --> 01:05:50,421
I don’t need you anymore.

724
01:05:52,047 --> 01:05:54,134
You came to get paid, right?

725
01:05:55,426 --> 01:05:58,513
Take it all! I’m leaving!

726
01:05:59,305 --> 01:06:02,766
Fine! Go and hear it from her...
- Ma’am!

727
01:06:09,691 --> 01:06:10,954
Take him.

728
01:06:10,984 --> 01:06:11,943
Go on.

729
01:06:12,652 --> 01:06:13,777
Take ‘em!

730
01:06:17,489 --> 01:06:19,826
Ma’am!

731
01:06:22,786 --> 01:06:25,248
Ma’am!

732
01:06:30,253 --> 01:06:31,296
Ma’am!

733
01:07:07,373 --> 01:07:08,583
Stay still!

734
01:07:18,646 --> 01:07:19,689
What the hell?

735
01:07:45,452 --> 01:07:46,578
Are you okay?

736
01:07:48,373 --> 01:07:49,374
Come to the front.

737
01:07:52,669 --> 01:07:53,795
Seatbelt on!

738
01:08:51,144 --> 01:08:52,936
What bitch drives like that?

739
01:09:55,428 --> 01:09:56,612
Ma’am!

740
01:10:04,342 --> 01:10:05,927
Ma’am!

741
01:10:06,301 --> 01:10:08,428
No!

742
01:10:52,557 --> 01:10:56,059
You have the money, right?

743
01:11:01,941 --> 01:11:03,025
Dear god!

744
01:11:13,578 --> 01:11:14,633
Yes?

745
01:11:14,661 --> 01:11:16,676
You finally answer.

746
01:11:16,706 --> 01:11:19,303
Been busy?

747
01:11:19,333 --> 01:11:21,305
What are you up to, Captain?

748
01:11:21,335 --> 01:11:24,058
I’m out catching a criminal,
of course.

749
01:11:24,087 --> 01:11:25,643
That’s good.

750
01:11:25,672 --> 01:11:28,729
We gave you her locations,
but you didn’t catch her.

751
01:11:28,759 --> 01:11:31,441
I was worried something was wrong.

752
01:11:31,471 --> 01:11:33,151
Thanks for worrying,

753
01:11:33,181 --> 01:11:36,028
but we lost her.

754
01:11:36,058 --> 01:11:39,615
Things don’t always
work out as planned.

755
01:11:39,645 --> 01:11:43,702
It doesn’t seem like
Jang Eun-ha is a kidnapper.

756
01:11:43,733 --> 01:11:45,872
What do you mean?

757
01:11:45,902 --> 01:11:49,917
We got a tip saying
the kid begged for people’s help

758
01:11:49,946 --> 01:11:52,253
and stopped a car and went with her.

759
01:11:52,283 --> 01:11:54,505
Are you sure she’s a kidnapper?

760
01:11:54,534 --> 01:11:58,008
We’ll catch her and prove it to you.

761
01:11:58,039 --> 01:12:00,427
If you just hand over the evidence...

762
01:12:00,458 --> 01:12:01,846
Forget it.

763
01:12:01,876 --> 01:12:04,390
Looks like the light is off.
Let’s investigate separately.

764
01:12:04,419 --> 01:12:07,268
If you need anything else,
send me an official request.

765
01:12:07,298 --> 01:12:08,466
Bye now.

766
01:12:10,801 --> 01:12:12,386
That son of a bitch!

767
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:14,971
That bitch!

768
01:12:24,856 --> 01:12:26,943
Stupid bastard.

769
01:12:29,861 --> 01:12:33,407
Can you talk?

770
01:12:42,708 --> 01:12:44,669
Hold on! We’re almost there.

771
01:13:05,021 --> 01:13:07,358
You finally found going halfway.

772
01:13:09,484 --> 01:13:11,165
You have a contact
in the police, right?

773
01:13:11,194 --> 01:13:11,790
Yes.

774
01:13:11,821 --> 01:13:14,084
Cross check the evidence
at Kim Du-shik’s murder scene.

775
01:13:14,115 --> 01:13:15,878
I’ll go to Jang Eun-ha’s last location.

776
01:13:15,907 --> 01:13:18,369
Okay driving that far?
- I have no choice!

777
01:14:20,473 --> 01:14:24,322
The first car that the bitch drove,
where was it registered?

778
01:14:24,352 --> 01:14:26,907
Gangneung, sir.
- And the other plates?

779
01:14:26,937 --> 01:14:29,535
The car she drove to the motel
and Daejeon?

780
01:14:29,564 --> 01:14:32,371
They’re all from different cities
like Incheon.

781
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:35,987
They were all abandoned
and expired cars, right?

782
01:14:37,156 --> 01:14:40,660
Find out where the cars were expired.
- Yes, sir.

783
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:44,830
Why’d you buy a junk car
for that much?

784
01:14:50,544 --> 01:14:52,712
You have way too much money, huh?

785
01:14:53,296 --> 01:14:56,395
And if you bought it,
why lose the key?

786
01:14:56,424 --> 01:14:58,469
You always lose yours, too.

787
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:04,015
Put it in deeper.
About a thumb’s length.

788
01:15:04,767 --> 01:15:06,977
You got a long way to go.

789
01:15:07,478 --> 01:15:09,480
Then why don’t you do it?

790
01:15:10,523 --> 01:15:12,775
Stop.
Now, turn right.

791
01:15:16,611 --> 01:15:18,376
Wow! It worked!

792
01:15:18,406 --> 01:15:20,533
Wanna drive, too?
- Sure!

793
01:15:22,660 --> 01:15:25,287
Your legs are too short. Sit here.

794
01:15:27,914 --> 01:15:29,095
Where do we go now?

795
01:15:29,125 --> 01:15:31,764
Ever been to Busan?
- No!

796
01:15:31,794 --> 01:15:32,639
Let’s go.

797
01:15:32,670 --> 01:15:35,256
The customer you have reached
is busy....

798
01:15:43,973 --> 01:15:45,277
Hello?

799
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:47,362
Boss.
- Why you!

800
01:15:47,393 --> 01:15:48,947
Where are you?

801
01:15:48,978 --> 01:15:51,397
What in the world are you up to?

802
01:15:53,816 --> 01:15:56,830
I can’t find a place
to watch the kid.

803
01:15:56,861 --> 01:15:59,166
I think...
- What?

804
01:15:59,195 --> 01:16:00,865
You’ll bring him here?

805
01:16:02,657 --> 01:16:03,921
Hurry.

806
01:16:03,950 --> 01:16:06,215
Pardon?
- No delivery destination.

807
01:16:06,245 --> 01:16:09,165
No returns. It’s the worst ever.

808
01:16:10,206 --> 01:16:11,595
He’s with you, right?

809
01:16:11,625 --> 01:16:14,348
Send his picture.
- Why?

810
01:16:14,377 --> 01:16:18,268
The bastards are cops!
This place won’t be safe either.

811
01:16:18,317 --> 01:16:21,897
Let’s send the kid abroad.
I’ll prepare his passport.

812
01:16:21,927 --> 01:16:24,566
Let’s wrap it up like a pro.

813
01:16:24,597 --> 01:16:26,389
Let’s finish the delivery.

814
01:16:28,559 --> 01:16:29,935
Are you listening?

815
01:16:31,686 --> 01:16:33,314
Yes, of course.

816
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:36,066
Stand straight.

817
01:16:42,031 --> 01:16:46,076
That’s dirty!
- You’re dirty! Stay still!

818
01:16:55,001 --> 01:16:56,170
Ready?

819
01:16:59,255 --> 01:17:00,382
Hey!

820
01:17:05,054 --> 01:17:07,722
One, two, three!

821
01:17:17,691 --> 01:17:19,985
Asif! Bring me some coffee!

822
01:17:37,670 --> 01:17:39,004
Ms. Jang Eun-ha.

823
01:17:41,966 --> 01:17:43,425
Do you have a boyfriend?

824
01:17:45,678 --> 01:17:47,721
Why?
- Just wondering.

825
01:17:49,597 --> 01:17:51,182
What’s your ideal man?

826
01:17:51,599 --> 01:17:55,104
Don’t know. Never thought of it.
- Then think now.

827
01:17:56,981 --> 01:17:59,161
Someone who doesn’t
pee his pants.

828
01:17:59,190 --> 01:18:01,861
Someone who doesn’t
ask silly questions. Happy?

829
01:18:04,655 --> 01:18:06,115
Guess not.

830
01:18:07,323 --> 01:18:08,462
TO BUSAN

831
01:18:08,491 --> 01:18:11,549
But...
- What now?

832
01:18:11,579 --> 01:18:13,873
Why’d you take my picture?

833
01:18:16,207 --> 01:18:18,305
It’s for going abroad.

834
01:18:18,334 --> 01:18:20,349
Who’s going abroad?

835
01:18:20,379 --> 01:18:23,143
You.
- Are you coming, too?

836
01:18:23,173 --> 01:18:24,215
No.

837
01:18:25,508 --> 01:18:26,897
Why?

838
01:18:26,926 --> 01:18:29,555
Aren’t we going to your house?

839
01:18:49,365 --> 01:18:52,756
We found it, boss.
All three cars were expired in Busan.

840
01:18:52,786 --> 01:18:56,624
They were taken by Baekgang Company.
I think it’s a junkyard.

841
01:19:00,628 --> 01:19:06,061
You bastard!
A cop shouldn’t chuck trash!

842
01:19:06,091 --> 01:19:08,093
I’m gonna retire anyway.

843
01:19:09,470 --> 01:19:13,515
Let’s go get our retirement money!

844
01:19:25,069 --> 01:19:26,111
Eun-ha!

845
01:19:27,987 --> 01:19:30,085
What’s with this junk?

846
01:19:30,115 --> 01:19:31,962
Watch it. It costs $20.000.

847
01:19:31,991 --> 01:19:34,256
20 grand? Why?

848
01:19:34,285 --> 01:19:36,383
Don’t know. Ask him.

849
01:19:36,412 --> 01:19:37,872
Why is this $20.000?

850
01:19:39,667 --> 01:19:42,723
What special delivery
takes so long?

851
01:19:42,753 --> 01:19:45,798
Right.
Maybe we should stop this gig.

852
01:19:47,549 --> 01:19:49,717
Let’s see.

853
01:19:50,135 --> 01:19:51,637
Baek-yeon.

854
01:19:52,471 --> 01:19:54,305
Yeok-bong.

855
01:19:55,181 --> 01:19:56,862
How do you read this?

856
01:19:56,891 --> 01:19:58,352
Ji-ho.

857
01:19:59,687 --> 01:20:01,408
Which one do you like?

858
01:20:01,437 --> 01:20:04,202
For what?
- Choose a name for yourself.

859
01:20:04,233 --> 01:20:08,915
I already have a name.
- I know, it’s Kim Seo-won.

860
01:20:08,946 --> 01:20:11,501
But lots of people have two names.

861
01:20:11,532 --> 01:20:15,297
You know EXO?
They all have two names.

862
01:20:15,326 --> 01:20:18,300
And Girlfriend?
- I don’t have a girlfriend.

863
01:20:18,329 --> 01:20:20,719
No, Girlfriend, the group.

864
01:20:20,748 --> 01:20:22,960
They all have two names, too.

865
01:20:23,669 --> 01:20:26,754
This way! Good!

866
01:20:27,798 --> 01:20:29,603
You’ll go on that car later.

867
01:20:29,632 --> 01:20:32,356
I’m going abroad on a car?
- Yup.

868
01:20:32,386 --> 01:20:36,402
There’s a huge ship
that takes cars like that.

869
01:20:36,432 --> 01:20:38,404
Never been on a ship?

870
01:20:38,434 --> 01:20:40,572
Just hold the wheel tight.

871
01:20:40,602 --> 01:20:44,159
After sleeping 5 nights,
you’ll arrive in my hometown.

872
01:20:44,189 --> 01:20:46,787
My dad promised to take care of you.

873
01:20:46,817 --> 01:20:50,499
Seo-won will have to eat
curry everyday.

874
01:20:50,529 --> 01:20:51,822
Boss!

875
01:20:52,655 --> 01:20:55,837
Okay. Ji- ho!
How’s that?

876
01:20:55,868 --> 01:20:57,076
Like it?

877
01:21:04,626 --> 01:21:07,391
After we send the kid,
I’ll make a deal with this.

878
01:21:07,421 --> 01:21:09,173
Tell ‘em to take it and scram.

879
01:21:10,174 --> 01:21:12,675
His dad probably brought this
to make the same deal.

880
01:21:13,427 --> 01:21:16,889
I’ll finish things off.
- Don’t bother.

881
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:20,476
You have a long way to go and learn.

882
01:21:27,106 --> 01:21:28,650
Goal!

883
01:21:29,275 --> 01:21:31,110
He brings back old memories?

884
01:21:49,963 --> 01:21:52,840
Sir! How’ve you been?

885
01:21:54,384 --> 01:21:55,511
Look.

886
01:21:56,595 --> 01:22:03,489
I have way too much money
coming to me when I retire soon.

887
01:22:03,519 --> 01:22:06,396
I can split it with you boys.
How about it?

888
01:22:08,564 --> 01:22:10,024
What can we do for you, sir?

889
01:22:11,819 --> 01:22:14,737
Find someone.
No, no, no.

890
01:22:15,697 --> 01:22:17,740
Find one bitch and a kid.

891
01:22:25,249 --> 01:22:26,959
Will you visit me?

892
01:22:28,001 --> 01:22:29,419
We’ll see.

893
01:22:30,629 --> 01:22:36,175
If you don’t have a boyfriend then,
want me to be one?

894
01:22:38,804 --> 01:22:41,472
What did you do?
- Nothing.

895
01:22:43,392 --> 01:22:46,615
Comb the area thoroughly
and let me know if you find anything.

896
01:22:46,645 --> 01:22:47,770
Yes, sir!

897
01:22:51,817 --> 01:22:54,027
Over here, sir!

898
01:23:00,993 --> 01:23:02,464
Du-shik!

899
01:23:02,493 --> 01:23:06,384
I’ll ask you one last time.

900
01:23:06,415 --> 01:23:07,749
Where’s the security fob?

901
01:23:08,499 --> 01:23:11,420
Where the hell is it! Tell me!

902
01:23:12,628 --> 01:23:14,464
I ate it.

903
01:23:15,007 --> 01:23:16,758
Cut my gut and take it.

904
01:23:20,554 --> 01:23:25,403
He’s not chasing a killer.
He is the killer!

905
01:23:25,434 --> 01:23:27,030
That bastard.

906
01:23:27,060 --> 01:23:28,907
Where’s Cho Kyeong-pil now?

907
01:23:28,936 --> 01:23:30,992
We lost track of him
after Busan Toll Gate.

908
01:23:31,023 --> 01:23:33,107
Okay. I’ll head to Busan.

909
01:23:47,873 --> 01:23:49,052
Ramen!

910
01:23:49,082 --> 01:23:51,460
Men? Mental!

911
01:23:53,587 --> 01:23:54,808
Talent.

912
01:23:54,837 --> 01:23:57,174
Ent? Ent?

913
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,219
That’s hard!

914
01:24:05,766 --> 01:24:07,850
Okay. Be there in two hours
when the ship departs.

915
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:10,771
Okay. Please take care of him.

916
01:25:06,576 --> 01:25:11,164
You must’ve driven.
Don’t drive drunk.

917
01:25:25,595 --> 01:25:27,264
Know who I am?

918
01:25:27,848 --> 01:25:28,974
A gangster?

919
01:25:30,183 --> 01:25:31,977
If not, you must be a cop.

920
01:25:32,894 --> 01:25:35,397
Or are you both with two jobs?

921
01:25:37,399 --> 01:25:42,446
I don’t care who you are.
Let me close up and go.

922
01:25:43,322 --> 01:25:44,906
Go home!

923
01:25:48,327 --> 01:25:50,704
Hide in here. Don’t move, okay?

924
01:25:55,459 --> 01:25:59,516
If you tell me just 3 things,
I’ll let you go home.

925
01:25:59,545 --> 01:26:00,881
Where’s the kid?

926
01:26:06,053 --> 01:26:07,386
Where’s Jang Eun-ha?

927
01:26:10,182 --> 01:26:11,350
Wanna die?

928
01:26:40,629 --> 01:26:43,060
Should’ve kept better employees.

929
01:26:43,090 --> 01:26:47,426
Why use commies
and illegal immigrants?

930
01:26:49,096 --> 01:26:54,016
Small business owners
need to save on labor.

931
01:26:54,518 --> 01:26:56,228
That’s true.

932
01:26:59,146 --> 01:27:04,956
Jang Eun-ha is damn good
at what she does.

933
01:27:04,986 --> 01:27:10,379
I’ve hired many drivers
over the years.

934
01:27:10,409 --> 01:27:12,536
But no one can work like her.

935
01:27:13,703 --> 01:27:16,915
She’s better than me in my prime.

936
01:27:17,916 --> 01:27:20,210
Student excels the master.
- Jeez.

937
01:27:23,462 --> 01:27:26,395
When I first met Eun-ha,

938
01:27:26,425 --> 01:27:30,554
I went to pick her up
as she crossed over.

939
01:27:31,972 --> 01:27:35,684
The girl was covered in blood.

940
01:27:38,644 --> 01:27:40,784
I’m just like her now.

941
01:27:40,814 --> 01:27:43,567
Are you a commie, too?

942
01:27:43,942 --> 01:27:46,873
Nope. I’m from Seoul.

943
01:27:46,902 --> 01:27:52,045
It was a side gig
when I ran a business in Russia.

944
01:27:52,074 --> 01:27:57,217
Taking runaway commies to Korea.
I had two jobs.

945
01:27:57,247 --> 01:27:59,010
Wow!

946
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:02,376
What a businessman!

947
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:06,465
So, where is she?

948
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:11,720
Huh?

949
01:28:16,807 --> 01:28:18,977
Who’s that? A new face!

950
01:28:21,103 --> 01:28:22,439
Illegal alien.

951
01:28:23,190 --> 01:28:27,569
You can tell me.
Where’s Jang Eun-ha and the kid?

952
01:28:29,111 --> 01:28:32,293
Don’t speak Korean?

953
01:28:32,324 --> 01:28:35,296
Where is Jang Eun-ha?

954
01:28:35,327 --> 01:28:36,661
Talk to me.

955
01:28:39,121 --> 01:28:42,303
Money!
I’ll pay you, so speak.

956
01:28:42,334 --> 01:28:45,045
I’ll give you money.
Very big money!

957
01:28:45,462 --> 01:28:46,962
Fuck you!

958
01:28:47,963 --> 01:28:49,269
Fuck?

959
01:28:49,299 --> 01:28:52,551
The bastard speaks Korean well.

960
01:28:56,389 --> 01:28:57,307
Asif!

961
01:28:58,557 --> 01:28:59,905
Stay put!

962
01:28:59,935 --> 01:29:01,102
Stop it!

963
01:29:02,229 --> 01:29:03,688
I’ll tell you! Stop it!

964
01:29:07,274 --> 01:29:09,528
I don’t know where they are.

965
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:13,240
I told them I’d call when I’m done.

966
01:29:14,199 --> 01:29:20,287
But I know
what you’re looking for.

967
01:29:21,831 --> 01:29:23,333
What am I looking for?

968
01:29:23,792 --> 01:29:26,585
The bank security fob, isn’t it?

969
01:29:27,629 --> 01:29:32,020
I’ll give it to you if you let us go.

970
01:29:32,050 --> 01:29:33,552
That’s my condition.

971
01:29:35,469 --> 01:29:36,638
Where is it?

972
01:29:39,808 --> 01:29:42,561
Ogwang, go.
- Yes, sir.

973
01:29:51,193 --> 01:29:53,738
Sir! There’s a lock.

974
01:29:56,283 --> 01:29:57,659
Fingerprint verification.

975
01:29:59,119 --> 01:30:00,494
Take ‘em out!

976
01:30:05,791 --> 01:30:08,210
Pull ‘em out at once,
so it’ll hurt less.

977
01:30:13,383 --> 01:30:15,050
Pull ‘em all at once!

978
01:30:27,314 --> 01:30:29,899
How much
are you getting paid for this?

979
01:30:31,985 --> 01:30:35,458
Putting your life on the line,
will you get a few hundred thousand?

980
01:30:35,488 --> 01:30:38,116
Think I’d do this
for a few hundred thousand?

981
01:31:03,141 --> 01:31:04,476
Boss...

982
01:31:05,976 --> 01:31:08,647
Asif, you idiot.

983
01:31:09,855 --> 01:31:14,319
I told you to go home.
You never listen.

984
01:31:23,953 --> 01:31:25,163
Shit.

985
01:31:28,625 --> 01:31:30,251
Is this what you’re looking for?

986
01:31:32,379 --> 01:31:34,726
Let’s find the kid and end this.

987
01:31:34,756 --> 01:31:37,342
$100.000 bonus to the first one
who finds him! Go!

988
01:31:38,510 --> 01:31:39,718
Find the kid!

989
01:31:41,971 --> 01:31:43,360
What is it?

990
01:31:43,390 --> 01:31:47,447
We received reports of gunfire
at a junkyard in Busan.

991
01:31:47,477 --> 01:31:50,241
It’s Baekgang Company
run by Baek Gang-chul...

992
01:31:50,271 --> 01:31:52,107
Baek Gang-chul?

993
01:31:52,898 --> 01:31:56,706
That’s it!
He brought Jang Eun-ha to Korea!

994
01:31:56,735 --> 01:31:58,904
Call Busan police for backup!

995
01:32:37,651 --> 01:32:39,486
Found 100 grand!

996
01:32:41,740 --> 01:32:43,241
Sir!

997
01:32:44,117 --> 01:32:45,951
Told ya I’d find him!

998
01:32:51,206 --> 01:32:53,334
Hello, kid.

999
01:33:49,098 --> 01:33:51,976
I told you I’d get you soon.

1000
01:33:55,396 --> 01:33:56,356
What?

1001
01:33:57,649 --> 01:33:58,942
What the hell?

1002
01:33:59,818 --> 01:34:04,614
Damn it! Turn on the lights!

1003
01:34:08,158 --> 01:34:09,369
Jang Eun-ha!

1004
01:35:28,281 --> 01:35:29,198
Let’s go.

1005
01:35:31,366 --> 01:35:32,911
Run! Hurry!

1006
01:36:09,530 --> 01:36:11,950
Bitch! You’re dead!

1007
01:36:52,407 --> 01:36:54,283
Bro! Are you okay?

1008
01:37:29,819 --> 01:37:32,070
Kim Seo-won!

1009
01:37:34,866 --> 01:37:36,159
Bro...

1010
01:37:49,922 --> 01:37:51,268
Asif...

1011
01:37:51,299 --> 01:37:53,217
Asif is over there.

1012
01:37:53,843 --> 01:37:56,386
He’s hurt badly.

1013
01:38:38,136 --> 01:38:39,846
Wait. Hold on.

1014
01:38:43,433 --> 01:38:44,769
Let the kid go.

1015
01:38:47,020 --> 01:38:48,909
Let’s end this already!

1016
01:38:48,940 --> 01:38:52,401
Got a smoke on ‘ya?
Shit. I left ‘em somewhere.

1017
01:38:53,277 --> 01:38:54,665
Hey!

1018
01:38:54,695 --> 01:38:57,668
Why are you asking to die?

1019
01:38:57,698 --> 01:38:59,700
When people are dying to live?

1020
01:39:00,450 --> 01:39:03,466
Didn’t you come to Korea
for a better life?

1021
01:39:03,496 --> 01:39:07,667
Why pull all this damn shit
for this kid!

1022
01:39:10,086 --> 01:39:12,045
Are you okay, ma’am?

1023
01:39:13,046 --> 01:39:14,799
Do I look okay to you?

1024
01:39:16,341 --> 01:39:20,525
I do all the driving
and the fighting...

1025
01:39:20,555 --> 01:39:22,014
Some boyfriend, you are.

1026
01:39:23,348 --> 01:39:24,851
What’s she saying?

1027
01:39:28,186 --> 01:39:32,108
Don’t worry, Kim Seo-won.
Let’s go together.

1028
01:39:36,903 --> 01:39:40,741
So damn heartrending.

1029
01:39:41,534 --> 01:39:42,909
Jang Eun-ha!

1030
01:39:44,786 --> 01:39:46,330
Life is...

1031
01:39:49,834 --> 01:39:52,712
going on your own.

1032
01:39:53,795 --> 01:39:54,796
Split up!

1033
01:40:39,467 --> 01:40:41,052
I’ll be right there.

1034
01:40:41,719 --> 01:40:42,637
What?

1035
01:41:27,974 --> 01:41:31,322
Ma’am! Please save her for me!

1036
01:41:31,352 --> 01:41:33,824
Please save her!

1037
01:41:33,854 --> 01:41:36,524
Take him.
Please!

1038
01:41:37,190 --> 01:41:38,829
Please!

1039
01:41:38,859 --> 01:41:40,444
No!

1040
01:42:30,828 --> 01:42:33,538
Ms. Jang Eun-ha? How are you?

1041
01:42:34,539 --> 01:42:36,125
I’m doing fine.

1042
01:42:38,044 --> 01:42:39,807
We have a new student.
Seo-won, greet the class.

1043
01:42:39,837 --> 01:42:41,422
I moved to a new school.

1044
01:42:42,006 --> 01:42:47,552
It’s really far from my old one,
so it was hard to adjust at first.

1045
01:42:48,512 --> 01:42:50,139
But I have many friends now.

1046
01:42:52,265 --> 01:42:53,862
Goal!

1047
01:42:53,893 --> 01:42:56,990
I live with Seung-wan
and play with him all the time.

1048
01:42:57,021 --> 01:42:58,856
Try it! It’s yummy.

1049
01:42:59,523 --> 01:43:00,953
Hurry!

1050
01:43:00,982 --> 01:43:04,707
I live at Happy Home Orphanage.

1051
01:43:04,737 --> 01:43:09,325
The food is great
and the teachers are very nice.

1052
01:43:15,206 --> 01:43:20,710
But the school bus driver
drives really roughly.

1053
01:43:23,923 --> 01:43:27,425
But he drives less dangerously
than you, ma’am.

1054
01:43:30,554 --> 01:43:34,445
By the way,
Asif takes good care of Chubby.

1055
01:43:34,475 --> 01:43:37,978
Eat lots.
- So don’t worry.

1056
01:43:40,106 --> 01:43:42,483
And...

1057
01:43:50,156 --> 01:43:51,837
That’s it for now.

1058
01:43:51,866 --> 01:43:54,923
I’ll leave the rest for later.

1059
01:43:54,954 --> 01:43:56,539
Bye!

1060
01:43:57,248 --> 01:43:58,541
Mister!

1061
01:44:52,052 --> 01:44:53,179
Ma’am!

1062
01:44:58,683 --> 01:44:59,768
Why you!

1063
01:45:00,144 --> 01:45:02,605
Hop on. I’ll drive you home.

1064
01:45:21,624 --> 01:45:27,128
SPECIAL DELIVERY

1065
01:45:27,712 --> 01:45:29,507
PICK UP ONE AT 7:00 P.M.
DROP OFF AT INCHEON PORT 8:00 P.M.

1066
01:45:37,318 --> 01:45:39,570
Can we drop by somewhere first?
