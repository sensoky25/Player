1
00:01:54,288 --> 00:01:56,332
<i>The trial for the chairman
of Kwang Industries</i>

2
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:58,117
<i>is set to begin in high court.</i>

3
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,380
<i>The trial is a culmination
of a year-long investigation</i>

4
00:02:00,381 --> 00:02:04,297
<i>of Korean seafood tycoon,
Kwang Gim, or "King" Kwang.</i>

5
00:02:04,298 --> 00:02:05,950
<i>Chairman Kwang faces charges</i>

6
00:02:05,951 --> 00:02:07,952
<i>that range from selling
counterfeit carbon offsets</i>

7
00:02:07,953 --> 00:02:09,738
<i>to violating bans
on net fishing.</i>

8
00:02:11,218 --> 00:02:13,915
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm here to apologize

9
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:16,047
to the true victims today.

10
00:02:16,048 --> 00:02:17,353
The Kwang family,

11
00:02:17,354 --> 00:02:21,315
and our 200,000
hard-working employees.

12
00:02:22,011 --> 00:02:26,189
For them, I look forward
to proving my innocence.

13
00:02:27,103 --> 00:02:28,191
Thank you.

14
00:02:37,374 --> 00:02:39,288
- What the hell was that?
- Kwang.

15
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:40,724
The charges are bullshit.

16
00:02:40,725 --> 00:02:43,249
You control trade routes.
Distribution centers.

17
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,252
You're a billionaire, and what,
they come up against you with

18
00:02:46,253 --> 00:02:47,688
fishing charges?

19
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:50,387
- Get out.
- Oh, okay.

20
00:02:56,088 --> 00:02:57,786
Where's my wife?

21
00:03:31,602 --> 00:03:32,907
Good morning, madam.

22
00:03:32,908 --> 00:03:34,648
May I help you?

23
00:03:34,649 --> 00:03:36,433
Just looking.

24
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,087
Please.

25
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:43,527
- Hmm.
- A brand-new model.

26
00:03:54,712 --> 00:03:56,757
The Ferrari 488 Pista Spider.

27
00:03:56,758 --> 00:03:58,846
It is the most beautiful
thing in this room.

28
00:03:58,847 --> 00:03:59,977
Hmm.

29
00:03:59,978 --> 00:04:01,327
Second only to you, of course.

30
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:04,635
- Can I look inside?
- Yes, for sure.

31
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,858
No, inside.

32
00:04:09,988 --> 00:04:11,555
Of course.

33
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,430
Behold, Ferrari's most
powerful V8 engine.

34
00:04:16,647 --> 00:04:20,694
Twin turbocharged, 3.9
liter, over 700 horsepower.

35
00:04:20,695 --> 00:04:22,305
Let's try it.

36
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,176
Yes.

37
00:05:01,997 --> 00:05:03,912
Ready?

38
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:16,490
You know how...
how to drive, huh?

39
00:05:16,664 --> 00:05:18,796
Yeah.

40
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:21,450
Whoa!

41
00:05:21,451 --> 00:05:23,626
Whoa!

42
00:05:23,627 --> 00:05:26,500
Whoa!

43
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:37,728
Thank God.

44
00:05:38,947 --> 00:05:41,123
Oh! Oh! Oh!

45
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:44,082
Whoa!

46
00:06:02,971 --> 00:06:05,146
What the hell are you
doing? This just came in.

47
00:06:05,147 --> 00:06:07,496
We haven't even
calibrated it yet.

48
00:06:07,497 --> 00:06:10,544
Oh, I'm sorry, Ms. Kwang.
I didn't see it was you.

49
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,849
The timing's off.

50
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,286
How long would it take
to adjust the timing?

51
00:06:15,287 --> 00:06:16,418
Two days.

52
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:18,987
Fine, for you, just one hour.

53
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:21,032
Thank you.

54
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:12,388
Joey, my love, you're home.

55
00:07:13,302 --> 00:07:14,476
Champagne?

56
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:16,348
What are we celebrating?

57
00:07:16,784 --> 00:07:20,048
Just another day with
my beautiful wife.

58
00:07:22,703 --> 00:07:24,444
Cheers.

59
00:07:27,185 --> 00:07:30,232
Where were you today? You
didn't pick up your phone.

60
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:33,147
Bad signal. Bad battery.

61
00:07:33,148 --> 00:07:35,150
Just, my trial started today.

62
00:07:36,325 --> 00:07:38,022
How did it go?

63
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:41,025
Officials want an investigation.

64
00:07:41,548 --> 00:07:43,288
Board members want my head.

65
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,248
Other than that, just great.

66
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,469
I'm sorry. Who's the snitch?

67
00:07:50,034 --> 00:07:52,297
That's an excellent question.

68
00:07:55,257 --> 00:07:56,911
You don't think it was me?

69
00:07:57,912 --> 00:08:01,480
Oh, darling, your
imagination is priceless.

70
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,874
You do know that a
wife can't testify.

71
00:08:04,832 --> 00:08:07,312
Then it's a good
thing we're married.

72
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,053
Is it?

73
00:08:09,924 --> 00:08:11,534
Of course it is.

74
00:08:12,796 --> 00:08:15,799
You know, there is a thing
I want to discuss with you.

75
00:08:15,886 --> 00:08:18,802
Is it necessary for you
to buy everything you see?

76
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,499
Where does it all go?

77
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,023
Oh me, darling.

78
00:08:22,284 --> 00:08:23,981
I'm merely asking.

79
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,288
Do you need another Ferrari?

80
00:08:33,382 --> 00:08:35,515
I bought it for you.

81
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,083
Happy birthday.

82
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,917
Sweetheart.

83
00:08:49,137 --> 00:08:50,704
Thank you.

84
00:09:00,104 --> 00:09:02,628
<i>Shares of Kwang dropped over 30%</i>

85
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:04,325
<i>after today's allegations.</i>

86
00:09:04,326 --> 00:09:06,675
<i>The stock had already
dropped to its all-time low</i>

87
00:09:06,676 --> 00:09:08,764
<i>earlier this month,
after officials assembled</i>

88
00:09:08,765 --> 00:09:11,159
<i>a task force to
investigate Kwang...</i>

89
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:15,771
Mom! It's knock,
wait, then enter.

90
00:09:15,772 --> 00:09:18,165
You can't just barge
in. I'm not a baby.

91
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,429
You'll always be my baby.

92
00:09:24,651 --> 00:09:26,826
This is the best part of my day.

93
00:09:26,827 --> 00:09:29,046
Yeah. Love you too, Mom.

94
00:09:31,701 --> 00:09:33,050
Oh...

95
00:09:33,398 --> 00:09:34,616
What are you doing?

96
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:37,314
Unpacking, Mom. Getting out.

97
00:09:37,315 --> 00:09:38,925
Stop for a second.
What's going on?

98
00:09:38,926 --> 00:09:41,668
Kwang has just made the
list of all-time assholes.

99
00:09:41,755 --> 00:09:44,060
Right next to Freddy
Krueger and Leatherface.

100
00:09:44,061 --> 00:09:46,149
- Not funny.
- Sorry. Bad joke.

101
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,238
But he's gonna be in jail
by the end of the week.

102
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:50,980
And I don't want to be here when
that happens, and neither do you.

103
00:09:50,981 --> 00:09:52,634
And where will you go?

104
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:55,158
Paris. The Ocean Outlaws
is docked there right now.

105
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:57,204
They're starting a
new mission next week.

106
00:09:57,205 --> 00:09:58,858
Heading to Milagro.

107
00:09:58,859 --> 00:10:00,816
Kwang has boats in Milagro.
How's that going to look?

108
00:10:00,817 --> 00:10:03,297
Like I have the will for
revolution and change.

109
00:10:03,298 --> 00:10:05,952
Like somebody's finally
standing up to Kwang.

110
00:10:05,953 --> 00:10:08,041
He's destroying entire
marine ecosystems.

111
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:09,956
Shhh!

112
00:10:09,957 --> 00:10:11,305
Mom, no.

113
00:10:11,306 --> 00:10:13,786
Just because you like
spending Kwang's money

114
00:10:13,787 --> 00:10:15,439
doesn't mean I
have to stay here.

115
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,660
Hey, stop it.

116
00:10:19,401 --> 00:10:22,012
You don't know what
you're talking about.

117
00:10:23,144 --> 00:10:25,146
Fine.

118
00:10:30,673 --> 00:10:32,719
I know you and Kwang
don't get along.

119
00:10:32,806 --> 00:10:34,154
- He's gross.
- He's not.

120
00:10:34,155 --> 00:10:35,634
I don't know why
you married him.

121
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,202
Because a long time
ago, I needed help.

122
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:41,379
We needed help, and
Kwang was there.

123
00:10:42,163 --> 00:10:44,773
We can't forget that, no
matter what you think of him.

124
00:10:44,774 --> 00:10:46,341
Do you understand?

125
00:10:49,736 --> 00:10:52,564
I'll take you to
Paris next weekend.

126
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,917
Okay?

127
00:10:57,439 --> 00:10:59,528
Do you miss Dad?

128
00:10:59,789 --> 00:11:01,007
Of course I do.

129
00:11:01,008 --> 00:11:02,791
Then why don't you
ever talk about him?

130
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:06,056
Because sometimes it's
easier to forget the past.

131
00:11:06,883 --> 00:11:09,755
- Besides, I told you everything.
- He was a pastry chef.

132
00:11:09,756 --> 00:11:11,582
He died in a car
accident. The end.

133
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,280
Seems there's a lot
more to fill in.

134
00:11:13,281 --> 00:11:15,848
All you need to know
is whatever happened,

135
00:11:15,849 --> 00:11:17,197
he brought me you.

136
00:11:17,198 --> 00:11:20,027
And I wouldn't
change any of that.

137
00:11:38,175 --> 00:11:39,872
Any of you guys got a cigarette?

138
00:11:39,873 --> 00:11:42,570
Hands up, dirtbag! I'm
not gonna say it again.

139
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:44,050
Yeah, I heard you
the first time.

140
00:11:44,051 --> 00:11:45,921
- Hands up. Now!
- All right, officer, please.

141
00:11:45,922 --> 00:11:47,488
Come on. I will comply.
Just give me a minute.

142
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:48,272
All right?

143
00:11:48,273 --> 00:11:49,534
You're scaring the fish.

144
00:11:52,973 --> 00:11:55,278
- Wait. Whoa, whoa! Come on.
- Let's go.

145
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,541
Officer, get those
cuffs off my agent, now!

146
00:11:57,542 --> 00:11:59,021
Your agent didn't have any ID.

147
00:11:59,022 --> 00:12:00,457
Because he's undercover.

148
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,329
Where do you suggest he
keep his badge? His ass?

149
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,896
Up yours? Get out!

150
00:12:03,897 --> 00:12:06,464
- Give me the key.
- Get out!

151
00:12:07,465 --> 00:12:08,944
Look after the fish.

152
00:12:08,945 --> 00:12:10,163
John, you okay?

153
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:11,947
I will be, once I
get a cigarette.

154
00:12:11,948 --> 00:12:14,472
- Where's Santiago?
- He's fine.

155
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:18,388
Santiago?

156
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:20,216
Everything's gonna be fine.

157
00:12:20,217 --> 00:12:23,350
You were supposed to observe
and report, not crash and burn.

158
00:12:23,351 --> 00:12:25,527
What the hell happened?

159
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,095
Our shift was going
really smooth.

160
00:12:28,573 --> 00:12:30,792
We were getting through
a lot of Kung Pow orders.

161
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:33,055
They're very good, by the
way, here, you should try it.

162
00:12:33,056 --> 00:12:34,317
John, stop stalling.

163
00:12:34,318 --> 00:12:36,232
All right, fine.

164
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:38,278
I was finishing a
tray of crème brûlées,

165
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:40,194
and the perps showed up.

166
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:57,733
We were getting it all on
camera, and then Santiago...

167
00:13:03,434 --> 00:13:05,131
- Hey!
- Is it yours?

168
00:13:05,132 --> 00:13:07,655
No, it's a fake. No, it's a
fake one. It's a fake one.

169
00:13:07,656 --> 00:13:11,093
You know, yesterday was a
party, and... with my kids,

170
00:13:11,094 --> 00:13:12,878
and I was police, you know?

171
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:14,967
No, <i>tranquilo.
Tranquilo.</i> No, no, no.

172
00:13:14,968 --> 00:13:17,012
<i>- Tranquilo, por favor.</i>
- Hey, hey, buddy, buddy, buddy.

173
00:13:17,013 --> 00:13:19,058
It's a friend of mine.
He... it's a joke, dude.

174
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:21,235
It... it's not even
real. It's not even real.

175
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,552

187

So, I just want
to stop fighting.

188
00:14:37,702 --> 00:14:39,966
- What do you want?
- I just want to eat.

189
00:14:41,184 --> 00:14:43,578
Well, you know I
don't like spicy.

190
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,362
<i>♪ I fell in to a ring of fire ♪</i>

191
00:14:46,363 --> 00:14:47,495

193
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:52,238
Oh, my God.

194
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:54,894
All right, just hang
on. All right? Hold up.

195

196

Huh? Dude, please.

198
00:15:02,466 --> 00:15:04,860
Come on. Give me a minute.

199
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:13,912
Oh, man.

200
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,915
Okay.

201
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,917
All right.

202
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:25,098
All right.

203
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,928
Sorry, man.

204
00:15:58,522 --> 00:16:00,176
Ah!

205
00:16:12,362 --> 00:16:13,973
Ah!

206
00:16:28,117 --> 00:16:29,422
I'll kill you!

207
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:30,901
Unh!

208
00:16:30,902 --> 00:16:31,991
Fire! Ah!

209
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:45,438
This way. This way, please.

210
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:47,440
All right, buddy.

211
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:49,094
Come on, up you get. Let's go.

212
00:16:49,095 --> 00:16:50,660
- Ah! Oh!
- You stay here.

213
00:16:50,661 --> 00:16:51,922
Just stay here, all right?

214
00:16:51,923 --> 00:16:54,100
I'll be back.

215
00:16:57,538 --> 00:16:59,105
Oh, no.

216
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,588
As an agent of the DEA,

217
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:07,503
I'm authorized to offer you
asylum for any information

218
00:17:07,504 --> 00:17:08,939
you have on Kwang Enterprises.

219
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,029
No.

220
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:17,035
I can offer you a green card,
at an apartment in Arizona.

221
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,514
It's very nice.

222
00:17:18,515 --> 00:17:20,256
No, no. Ai!

223
00:17:59,556 --> 00:18:01,602
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

224
00:18:02,646 --> 00:18:04,257
Come on.

225
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:15,268
And that's when they
put the bracelets on.

226
00:18:17,748 --> 00:18:20,098
I suppose you want to go see?

227
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,403
Let's go.

228
00:18:21,404 --> 00:18:22,710
Watch your step.

229
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:27,931
Ah! Is that a fish?

230
00:18:27,932 --> 00:18:29,237
John, what the...

231
00:18:29,238 --> 00:18:31,936
Six months of undercover
work up in smoke.

232
00:18:32,328 --> 00:18:34,982
Please tell me, how am I
supposed to build a case on this?

233
00:18:34,983 --> 00:18:38,508
You can't. There's absolutely
nothing useful here.

234
00:18:46,908 --> 00:18:50,390
I don't know. Maybe
you can use this?

235
00:18:58,311 --> 00:19:00,139
Sir! Sir.

236
00:19:00,748 --> 00:19:02,836
With the help of
local law enforcement,

237
00:19:02,837 --> 00:19:06,753
we were able to recover
nearly 400 kilos of heroin.

238
00:19:06,754 --> 00:19:10,626
Estimated street
value, $300 million.

239
00:19:10,627 --> 00:19:12,802
But there is still
much to be done.

240
00:19:12,803 --> 00:19:14,369
<i>Every day in the United States,</i>

241
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:17,372
<i>120 people die
from drug overdose.</i>

242
00:19:17,373 --> 00:19:19,983
We are committed to fighting
this problem at its source,

243
00:19:19,984 --> 00:19:22,247
and stopping those
who would profit

244
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:24,031
from this death and suffering.

245
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:28,254
<i>Don't care who you
are, where you are,</i>

246
00:19:28,341 --> 00:19:30,951
<i>you cannot run, you cannot hide.</i>

247
00:19:30,952 --> 00:19:33,607
We will find you.

248
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:39,482
Damn it!

249
00:20:17,825 --> 00:20:19,565
Oh!

250
00:20:19,566 --> 00:20:21,524
Oh, you scared me!

251
00:20:22,351 --> 00:20:24,179
I'm sorry about earlier.

252
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:27,226
I wasn't mad at you.

253
00:20:28,836 --> 00:20:30,925
Hard to tell these days.

254
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,624
It's just this ridiculous trial.

255
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:37,931
Let's go to the summer
house for the weekend.

256
00:20:37,932 --> 00:20:40,325
- Get out of here.
- Oh!

257
00:20:40,326 --> 00:20:43,242
Sure. That will be nice.

258
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:46,461
Thank you for my
birthday present.

259
00:20:46,462 --> 00:20:47,811
I like it a lot.

260
00:20:49,552 --> 00:20:51,989
But you know what
I would love more?

261
00:20:55,471 --> 00:20:57,647
Let me go freshen up.

262
00:21:00,346 --> 00:21:02,564
Joey, let's just talk.

263
00:21:02,565 --> 00:21:05,699
- About what?
- About us.

264
00:21:06,482 --> 00:21:08,005
About love.

265
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:12,749
I don't know if I
have any love to give.

266
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:14,882
Of course you do.

267
00:21:15,665 --> 00:21:17,319
You love Raymond.

268
00:21:18,102 --> 00:21:19,669
You love shopping.

269
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,977
You love me.

270
00:21:24,718 --> 00:21:26,285
Do I?

271
00:21:27,547 --> 00:21:28,678
No.

272
00:21:36,425 --> 00:21:38,732
Joey, it's been 15 years.

273
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:44,041
15 years since I've taken
care of you and Raymond.

274
00:21:44,607 --> 00:21:47,523
Whoever broke your heart
is not coming back.

275
00:21:48,568 --> 00:21:51,048
Don't you think it's
time to move on?

276
00:21:51,962 --> 00:21:53,486
Together?

277
00:22:17,814 --> 00:22:19,381
I love you.

278
00:22:47,235 --> 00:22:48,670
What is it, Lawlor?

279
00:22:48,671 --> 00:22:50,977
Hey, um, I've been going
over this tip sheet,

280
00:22:50,978 --> 00:22:53,850
and there's a confidential
informant that's come forward.

281
00:22:54,242 --> 00:22:57,026
Kwang Industries. Why
am I not surprised?

282
00:22:57,027 --> 00:22:58,941
Illegal net fishing.
Killing dolphins.

283
00:22:58,942 --> 00:23:00,466
You want to take
Kwang down for this?

284
00:23:00,553 --> 00:23:02,597
We put away Al
Capone for tax fraud.

285
00:23:02,598 --> 00:23:04,382
I mean, the C.I. wants
to give us his ledger.

286
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,819
No one with real information
is gonna rat out on Kwang.

287
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,995
They're all too scared of
him. This is chicken shit.

288
00:23:08,996 --> 00:23:10,692
What if it isn't?

289
00:23:10,693 --> 00:23:13,391
What if this is everything we
need to finally take him down?

290
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,305
- What's the handoff?
- Taipei.

291
00:23:15,306 --> 00:23:17,699
No. Absolutely not. After
what happened last time.

292
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,048
That was 15 years ago.

293
00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:20,789
And look where it's landed you.

294
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:23,489
15 years of bouncing around from
field office to field office,

295
00:23:23,576 --> 00:23:25,098
and doing mostly desk work.

296
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:27,406
Look, we all want
to take Kwang down.

297
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:31,147
- You stopped the shipment.
- One shipment. One.

298
00:23:31,148 --> 00:23:33,236
Take your wins as they come,
and leave the rest alone.

299
00:23:33,237 --> 00:23:34,977
Charlotte, it's one weekend.

300
00:23:34,978 --> 00:23:37,240
Just a couple of days, to
finally take him down for good.

301
00:23:37,241 --> 00:23:39,591
Even if we wanted to, I can't
send an agent down there,

302
00:23:39,592 --> 00:23:40,766
and certainly not you.

303
00:23:40,767 --> 00:23:42,550
I will go deep
cover. My own assets.

304
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:44,117
- No one'll even know I'm there.
- No.

305
00:23:44,118 --> 00:23:45,945
I am literally going
to pick up a ledger.

306
00:23:45,946 --> 00:23:47,816
- No, absolutely not.
- Charlotte, think about...

307
00:23:47,817 --> 00:23:49,602
No!

308
00:23:51,908 --> 00:23:53,692
All right, thanks.

309
00:23:53,693 --> 00:23:55,476
- Thank you so much.
- What is wrong with you?

310
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:58,045
You're like a dog with
a bone. Let it go.

311
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,440
Here. To be perfectly clear.

312
00:24:04,355 --> 00:24:07,314
A leave of absence? You're
sending me home now?

313
00:24:07,315 --> 00:24:09,708
No, John. I'm sending
you on vacation.

314
00:24:09,709 --> 00:24:11,666
It's what happens when
people do a good job.

315
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:13,929
Actually, a great job.
It was a solid bust.

316
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,670
Now, go relax.

317
00:24:15,671 --> 00:24:18,718
The drugs will still be here
on Tuesday, and so will Kwang.

318
00:24:18,979 --> 00:24:22,111
- Just, so, it's a long weekend.
- Yeah, John.

319
00:24:22,112 --> 00:24:24,854
Go drink something fruity
on a beach somewhere.

320
00:24:25,812 --> 00:24:27,378
All right.

321
00:24:27,944 --> 00:24:29,249
Okay. Thanks.

322
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:32,296
Um, I will definitely
make the most of it.

323
00:24:32,993 --> 00:24:35,777
- Oh! Can you do me one favor?
- What?

324
00:24:35,778 --> 00:24:38,389
- Could you just watch my fish?
- Get out!

325
00:24:47,181 --> 00:24:50,183
Hi, I'm checking on
Flight 726 to Taipei.

326
00:24:50,184 --> 00:24:53,361
- You're George Washington?
- Yep, that's me.

327
00:24:54,623 --> 00:24:57,757
Welcome aboard. Walk
this way, please.

328
00:25:15,992 --> 00:25:17,602
- Uh, excuse me, miss?
- Yes?

329
00:25:17,603 --> 00:25:18,951
Can I get a bourbon?
Two doubles.

330
00:25:18,952 --> 00:25:20,823
Oh, after take-off.

331
00:26:08,871 --> 00:26:11,526
Raymond. Good morning.

332
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:16,922
Can I help you with something?

333
00:26:16,923 --> 00:26:18,967
Oh, I'm just looking
for a pencil sharpener.

334
00:26:18,968 --> 00:26:20,404
Hmm.

335
00:26:21,971 --> 00:26:24,887
You know, I'd love to see
your drawings one day.

336
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:30,676
Hey, how about we go play
golf together sometime, huh?

337
00:26:31,241 --> 00:26:32,808
No.

338
00:26:33,722 --> 00:26:35,289
Raymond.

339
00:26:37,291 --> 00:26:39,293
You know, I'm trying my best.

340
00:26:41,687 --> 00:26:43,471
Why do you hate me so much?

341
00:26:50,696 --> 00:26:53,045
<i>The Austrian women's volleyball
team will face off this weekend</i>

342
00:26:53,046 --> 00:26:55,743
<i>against Chinese Taipei in
a preseason exhibition game</i>

343
00:26:55,744 --> 00:26:57,919

00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:04,710

00:27:05,798 --> 00:27:07,973

<i>We've been...</i>

349
00:27:22,379 --> 00:27:24,816
Mm! Hey! Yo!

350
00:27:24,817 --> 00:27:26,079
Over here.

351
00:27:27,036 --> 00:27:28,515
You don't look like
a George Washington.

352
00:27:28,516 --> 00:27:30,648
Yeah? You look like
you gained weight.

353
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:34,478
Hmm! Haven't you heard?
Dad bods are cool now.

354
00:27:36,263 --> 00:27:39,832
- Say hello to Freddie.
- Let's get to the hotel.

355
00:28:07,294 --> 00:28:08,555
Welcome, Mr. Washington.

356
00:28:08,556 --> 00:28:09,513
I see we have you
for the weekend.

357
00:28:09,514 --> 00:28:11,601
- You do.
- Any luggage?

358
00:28:11,602 --> 00:28:12,907
Yeah, three pieces.

359
00:28:12,908 --> 00:28:14,388
Now, welcome to
Taipei Marriott Hotel.

360
00:28:15,606 --> 00:28:16,998
Ooh la la.

361
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:18,217
I'm here to pick
up a ledger, man.

362
00:28:18,218 --> 00:28:19,741
Pray for the best.

363
00:28:19,828 --> 00:28:21,656
Pray for the
worst. Yeah, yeah.

364
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:24,527
- Hey, what time's the drop?
- Five p.m.

365
00:28:24,528 --> 00:28:26,921
Ooh, we've got time for a
late lunch or an early dinner.

366
00:28:26,922 --> 00:28:28,968
- Which one you prefer?
- Shower.

367
00:28:29,272 --> 00:28:32,144
- Shower. Hey, but this is good.
- Yes.

368
00:28:32,145 --> 00:28:34,234
Yeah!

369
00:28:50,946 --> 00:28:52,469
Come with me now.

370
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:58,213
No!

371
00:28:58,214 --> 00:29:00,563
What are you doing? Stop it!

372
00:29:00,564 --> 00:29:02,957
Stop it! Don't
have him killed!

373
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:04,654
Enough.

374
00:29:04,655 --> 00:29:05,918
Enough!

375
00:29:07,484 --> 00:29:08,658
W... Why?

376
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:11,270
Because our beloved
son is the snitch.

377
00:29:11,271 --> 00:29:12,489
No.

378
00:29:12,968 --> 00:29:15,056
- I don't believe it.
- Well, believe it.

379
00:29:15,057 --> 00:29:17,145
He's trying to ruin me.

380
00:29:17,146 --> 00:29:18,668
Destroy everything we've built.

381
00:29:18,669 --> 00:29:20,802
You're wrong. You're wrong.

382
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,282
You promised to protect us.

383
00:29:23,283 --> 00:29:26,155
Sweetheart, I am
trying to protect us.

384
00:29:26,373 --> 00:29:29,245
You think you're so
clever, don't you, huh?

385
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:40,429
- Now, where is the ledger?
- Raymond!

386
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:43,258
Is this true? Give it
back! Give it back.

387
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:44,912
His tuna boats are
killing dolphins.

388
00:29:44,913 --> 00:29:46,871
- Dolphins?
- His processing plants...

389
00:29:46,872 --> 00:29:48,611
You did this because
of some dolphins?

390
00:29:48,612 --> 00:29:50,789
You're destroying our ecosystem!

391
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,615
I had to do something.

392
00:29:52,616 --> 00:29:55,358
Good for you.
Taking initiative.

393
00:29:55,837 --> 00:29:58,186
But where is my ledger?

394
00:29:58,187 --> 00:30:02,408
Because the rest of it has
nothing to do with any dolphins!

395
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:04,280
Leave me!

396
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:08,807
Kwang? Just give me a
minute. I'll talk to him.

397
00:30:10,069 --> 00:30:11,591
Please?

398
00:30:11,592 --> 00:30:13,202
Okay.

399
00:30:17,163 --> 00:30:20,078
Just tell him. Hey, it's fine.

400
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:22,777
Just tell him what's
going on, hon.

401
00:30:22,995 --> 00:30:24,996
Please, Mom. Five minutes.

402
00:30:24,997 --> 00:30:27,433
I just need five minutes.

403
00:30:27,434 --> 00:30:29,565
I need to get the
ledger to Lawlor.

404
00:30:29,566 --> 00:30:31,263
What?

405
00:30:31,264 --> 00:30:33,309
Some agent, John Lawlor.

406
00:30:35,181 --> 00:30:36,964
John Lawlor.

407
00:30:36,965 --> 00:30:40,926
He emailed me back. I just
need five more minutes.

408
00:30:41,013 --> 00:30:44,233
- What are you talking about?
- Mom, please.

409
00:30:44,581 --> 00:30:46,017
Five minutes.

410
00:30:46,018 --> 00:30:47,540
What?

411
00:30:47,541 --> 00:30:50,238
- Please, Mom.
- No. No, what... what...

412
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:51,674
Oh my God.

413
00:30:51,675 --> 00:30:54,896
Oh! What are you talking about?

414
00:30:54,983 --> 00:30:56,244
Please, Mom.

415
00:30:56,245 --> 00:30:57,898
Okay, that's enough, now.

416
00:30:57,899 --> 00:30:59,683
All right.

417
00:31:00,249 --> 00:31:01,816
Five minutes.

418
00:31:07,778 --> 00:31:10,084
- Hit me.
- What?

419
00:31:10,085 --> 00:31:12,958
It's the only way he'll
talk. Now, hit me.

420
00:31:15,482 --> 00:31:16,787
I won't hit you.

421
00:31:27,668 --> 00:31:29,670
I hate smoking.

422
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:38,287
It's filthy.

423
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,116
And a burnt smell
gets into your hair,

424
00:31:42,117 --> 00:31:44,685
your clothes, your fingernails.

425
00:31:46,078 --> 00:31:49,298
No matter what you do, you
just can't get rid of it.

426
00:31:52,867 --> 00:31:54,390
It's awful.

427
00:31:57,132 --> 00:31:59,091
But when we got married,

428
00:32:01,702 --> 00:32:03,529
I had to start.

429
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:05,531
The smoking smell
is nothing compared

430
00:32:05,532 --> 00:32:08,100
to the smell of my husband.

431
00:32:08,883 --> 00:32:12,974
The smell of sweaty
desperation. It makes me gag.

432
00:32:18,023 --> 00:32:20,981
No matter what he does or
how much money he spends,

433
00:32:20,982 --> 00:32:22,984
or how much he scrubs,

434
00:32:23,376 --> 00:32:26,161
the putrid stink...

435
00:32:29,643 --> 00:32:31,210
never goes away.

436
00:32:37,172 --> 00:32:38,957
- Funny?
- Ah!

437
00:32:39,087 --> 00:32:40,741
Ah! Ah!

438
00:32:56,713 --> 00:32:58,715
Die!

439
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,196
No!

440
00:33:02,197 --> 00:33:04,546
Now, you tell me.
Where is my ledger?

441
00:33:04,547 --> 00:33:05,591
Stop! Stop!

442
00:33:05,592 --> 00:33:06,636
- Don't touch him!
- Hmm?

443
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,203
I gave you everything.
And you do this to me?

444
00:33:09,204 --> 00:33:10,509
Don't touch...

445
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:12,250
Stop. Stop. Please, stop.

446
00:33:12,251 --> 00:33:14,339
I'll tell you where the
ledger is. Just stop it.

447
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,384
Stop it!

448
00:33:16,385 --> 00:33:19,867
I had a friend take the
ledger to the Marriott Hotel.

449
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:22,174
It's Room 2018.

450
00:33:22,696 --> 00:33:24,219
What do you mean, "had"?

451
00:33:29,572 --> 00:33:31,617
Hey, John. Get involved.

452
00:33:31,618 --> 00:33:33,488
They ain't got chicken feet
like this in Minnesota.

453
00:33:33,489 --> 00:33:34,750
You got xiaolongbao?

454
00:33:34,751 --> 00:33:37,102
No. We got shumai,
though. You like shumai?

455
00:33:40,235 --> 00:33:41,889
I got it.

456
00:34:06,261 --> 00:34:07,828
I don't believe it.

457
00:34:07,915 --> 00:34:10,395
- It's all here.
- What's that?

458
00:34:10,396 --> 00:34:12,875
All this for a little red book?

459
00:34:12,876 --> 00:34:14,791
You took too many guns.

460
00:34:15,966 --> 00:34:17,619
Go find the ledger.

461
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,707
Yes.

462
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:21,450
You! Keep her.
You! Come with me.

463
00:34:23,757 --> 00:34:26,846
- And as for you...
- Mom.

464
00:34:26,847 --> 00:34:28,936
During the Joseon Dynasty,

465
00:34:30,024 --> 00:34:32,635
anybody that would
break the law...

466
00:34:33,941 --> 00:34:37,683
Mommy!
-...was forever marked as a criminal.

467
00:34:37,684 --> 00:34:40,860
- Mom!
- No! No! No!

468
00:34:40,861 --> 00:34:43,515
And depending on the
severity of the crime...

469
00:34:43,516 --> 00:34:47,606
No! Oh, no! Please!
Please! Stop! No! No! No!

470
00:34:47,607 --> 00:34:49,260
They were cut into quarters.

471
00:34:49,261 --> 00:34:51,611
Stop! Stop!

472
00:34:52,742 --> 00:34:54,527
Ah!

473
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:56,485
And they would start...

474
00:34:58,052 --> 00:35:00,488
with the limbs.

475
00:35:00,489 --> 00:35:02,403
- Oh no!
- Oh my God!

476
00:35:02,404 --> 00:35:04,189
No, Mom! No!

477
00:35:04,276 --> 00:35:05,711
Don't worry, son, we'll get
you the best prosthetics

478
00:35:05,712 --> 00:35:08,148
- that money can buy.
- No! No!

479
00:35:08,149 --> 00:35:09,368
No!

480
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:19,769
Let him go.

481
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:21,641
Sweetheart.

482
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,642
What, you're killing people now?

483
00:35:23,643 --> 00:35:24,991
Let us go!

484
00:35:24,992 --> 00:35:26,950
You're not gonna shoot me.

485
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,649
Who's gonna protect you?

486
00:35:31,303 --> 00:35:32,913
Who's gonna love you?

487
00:35:33,261 --> 00:35:34,480
- Ah!
- Oh!

488
00:35:36,221 --> 00:35:38,092
What?

489
00:35:38,527 --> 00:35:39,615
What?

490
00:35:41,965 --> 00:35:43,357
Mom, slow down.

491
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:44,837
Where'd you learn how
to drive like this?

492
00:35:44,838 --> 00:35:46,317
Gotta get to the hotel.

493
00:35:46,318 --> 00:35:48,494
- Warn him.
- What? Warn who?

494
00:35:49,712 --> 00:35:51,540
Wipe your nose.

495
00:36:03,378 --> 00:36:05,250
Help!

496
00:36:35,149 --> 00:36:38,543
I can't believe you're still
on Kwang after all this time.

497
00:36:38,544 --> 00:36:41,286
With all this, I can put
him away for two lifetimes.

498
00:36:44,724 --> 00:36:45,812
This way.

499
00:36:51,513 --> 00:36:53,123
Take them out.

500
00:37:07,442 --> 00:37:10,924
Ooh! Dessert is served.

501
00:37:17,496 --> 00:37:21,369
Hello, boys. Are you
my club sandwich?

502
00:37:26,635 --> 00:37:28,462
Thank you, sir.

503
00:37:28,463 --> 00:37:30,857
A little bit of sugar ain't
gonna ruin that six-pack.

504
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:39,038
- What?
- Kid lied to us. No one here.

505
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:40,605
Well, they have to be somewhere.

506
00:37:40,606 --> 00:37:43,217
You go check the rest
of the hotel, okay?

507
00:37:57,187 --> 00:37:59,014
Can I help you, sir?

508
00:37:59,015 --> 00:38:02,280
I'm looking for my American
partners. They check in today,

509
00:38:11,637 --> 00:38:12,725
I take it.

510
00:38:32,527 --> 00:38:34,006
- Hey.
- Joey?

511
00:38:34,007 --> 00:38:35,703
We need to talk.
It's an emergency.

512
00:38:35,704 --> 00:38:39,011
What are you doing here?
How did you find me?

513
00:38:39,012 --> 00:38:40,534
Hey, what happened to your face?

514
00:38:40,535 --> 00:38:42,407
Mom, who's this?

515
00:38:42,494 --> 00:38:44,973
- "Mom"? You have a son?
- John, you're in danger.

516
00:38:44,974 --> 00:38:47,759
- Wait, wait. His name's John?
- Shh! Quiet. Mommy's talking.

517
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,849
- What... what's going on here?
- Listen, they know you have the ledger.

518
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:53,940
Kwang is sending men right
now to kill all of you.

519
00:38:54,506 --> 00:38:56,158
- Go to the bathroom.
- Okay.

520
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:57,900
How do you know about Kwang?

521
00:38:58,553 --> 00:39:00,947
Because I'm married to him.

522
00:39:02,252 --> 00:39:05,821
Wait, wait. Okay, Mom,
seriously, who is this guy?

523
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,171
- Why is he looking at me like...
- Quiet! Both of you!

524
00:39:09,172 --> 00:39:11,565
If you want to know more,
we have to leave right now.

525
00:39:11,566 --> 00:39:14,133
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hold
on a minute, all right?

526
00:39:14,134 --> 00:39:15,569
I'm just gonna need a minute.

527
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:17,441
I haven't seen you in,
what, like, 15 years?

528
00:39:17,442 --> 00:39:19,444
Just give me a
minute. All right?

529
00:39:32,457 --> 00:39:34,894
- Get in.
- Okay, okay.

530
00:39:41,944 --> 00:39:43,031
Come on!

531
00:39:43,032 --> 00:39:45,992
Cover us! Get to the bathroom.

532
00:39:47,123 --> 00:39:48,603
Cover us, please.

533
00:39:53,826 --> 00:39:55,523
Get under the sink.

534
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,964
Open the door.

535
00:40:31,864 --> 00:40:34,300
- What?
- Yo, boss. We found them.

536
00:40:34,301 --> 00:40:37,783
<i>- Your wife's here.</i>
- You bring me my wife...

537
00:40:38,523 --> 00:40:40,438
and you kill everyone else.

538
00:40:44,093 --> 00:40:45,704
What about the kid?

539
00:40:46,792 --> 00:40:50,143
Hello? Hello?

540
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:56,236
Hold on.

541
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,455
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop,

542
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,978
stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

543
00:40:59,979 --> 00:41:03,330
You guys have the wrong room.
You have the wrong room.

544
00:41:10,424 --> 00:41:12,470
Go find them.

545
00:42:09,744 --> 00:42:11,311
Shoot!

546
00:42:51,307 --> 00:42:52,569
You all right?

547
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,050
- Yeah.
- Okay.

548
00:43:03,232 --> 00:43:05,712
Follow me.

549
00:43:05,713 --> 00:43:07,585
Follow him.

550
00:43:08,237 --> 00:43:10,022
Follow me.

551
00:43:20,423 --> 00:43:21,990
Go.

552
00:43:25,385 --> 00:43:27,953
Stairs. Stairs.

553
00:43:49,714 --> 00:43:51,324
Step away from the door.

554
00:44:09,168 --> 00:44:10,735
Stairs.

555
00:44:15,827 --> 00:44:17,611
Open it!

556
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,328
No, no, no, no. Come
this way. To the bar.

557
00:44:40,329 --> 00:44:42,026
What are you doing?
We need to go.

558
00:44:42,027 --> 00:44:44,333
It's just the cops.
Just let them go past.

559
00:44:51,906 --> 00:44:53,994
So he's really Kwang's son?

560
00:44:53,995 --> 00:44:55,997
- No.
- Definitely not.

561
00:44:56,955 --> 00:44:59,478
Raymond, meet your son,
John. John, meet your dad.

562
00:44:59,479 --> 00:45:01,220
What?

563
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,226
Raymond, meet your dad.
John, meet your son.

564
00:45:13,972 --> 00:45:15,320
Any questions?

565
00:45:15,321 --> 00:45:16,713
So you're not a chef?

566
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,585
No.

567
00:45:19,891 --> 00:45:22,720
Come on, let's go. Come on.

568
00:45:30,945 --> 00:45:33,077
Hey! Excuse me, sir.

569
00:45:33,078 --> 00:45:34,818
Hey! After them! Hey!

570
00:45:34,819 --> 00:45:36,777
- Is this yours?
- Yeah.

571
00:45:38,823 --> 00:45:40,738
- There's only two seats.
- Get in here.

572
00:45:44,524 --> 00:45:47,092
Stop him, hurry!
Stop the Ferrari.

573
00:45:53,402 --> 00:45:55,230
Stop looking at me.

574
00:45:56,057 --> 00:45:57,971
- Are we going to the police?
- No.

575
00:45:57,972 --> 00:46:00,321
- Why not?
- Kwang knows every cop in town.

576
00:46:00,322 --> 00:46:01,975
And I'm not even
supposed to be here.

577
00:46:01,976 --> 00:46:03,847
What? Why?

578
00:46:03,848 --> 00:46:05,109
I was going after Kwang.
I'm not officially here.

579
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:06,806
I came alone.

580
00:46:06,807 --> 00:46:09,417
So you came back after all this
time for Kwang, but not for me?

581
00:46:09,418 --> 00:46:11,376
How was I supposed to
even know you were here?

582
00:46:11,377 --> 00:46:13,509
Because I live here, remember?

583
00:46:16,121 --> 00:46:18,252
You're supposed to be dead.

584
00:46:18,253 --> 00:46:19,732
Yeah, well, give
it another minute,

585
00:46:19,733 --> 00:46:21,333
kid, and your mom will
take care of that.

586
00:46:27,915 --> 00:46:29,698
I see you haven't changed a bit.

587
00:46:29,699 --> 00:46:31,483
Thanks. I moisturize.

588
00:46:31,484 --> 00:46:35,009
- And no sugar. It ages you.
- I meant your driving.

589
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:39,492
Sir.

590
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:43,887
The guest name is George
Washington. He's American.

591
00:46:43,888 --> 00:46:47,326
And what is George Washington
doing with Kwang's wife?

592
00:46:51,286 --> 00:46:53,374
All this time

593
00:46:53,375 --> 00:46:55,594
I've been taking cooking classes to
get close to my dead pastry chef dad,

594
00:46:55,595 --> 00:46:57,553
and he's not even dead.

595
00:46:58,641 --> 00:47:01,513
- Pastry chef? Seriously?
- Shh. Quiet, please.

596
00:47:01,514 --> 00:47:04,255
And why am I a dead pastry chef?
- Yeah, Mom, why?

597
00:47:04,256 --> 00:47:06,475
Everyone, shut up
and let me drive.

598
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:13,917
Actually, uh...

599
00:47:13,918 --> 00:47:16,615
I was a pastry chef
for about a month.

600
00:47:16,616 --> 00:47:18,792
I make a mean crème brûlée.

601
00:47:20,446 --> 00:47:21,534
Well.

602
00:47:28,584 --> 00:47:30,499
Sir.

603
00:47:43,425 --> 00:47:45,688
You go find my wife.

604
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:57,612
Mom, I'm bleeding.

605
00:47:57,613 --> 00:48:00,224
- What?
- No, it's not you, kid. It's me.

606
00:48:00,225 --> 00:48:03,009
Raymond, put
pressure. Right there.

607
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:05,446
No, no, no, no, no. Down. Yes.

608
00:48:05,447 --> 00:48:08,536
- We have to get to a hospital.
- No. No hospital.

609
00:48:08,537 --> 00:48:11,279
- Mom?
- I've got an idea.

610
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,766
What the...

611
00:48:20,767 --> 00:48:23,160
- Hey, hey!
- Hey, I'm so sorry.

612
00:48:23,161 --> 00:48:25,162
Driving a sports car, so what?

613
00:48:25,163 --> 00:48:26,467
Who do you think you are?

614
00:48:26,468 --> 00:48:27,948
So sorry.

615
00:48:29,689 --> 00:48:32,169
Once you've hacked in,
check all the traffic cams.

616
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:35,477
Flag anybody in a red
Ferrari. That'll be her.

617
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:42,744
Get off the car!

618
00:48:42,745 --> 00:48:44,921
Hands, hands! Show
me your hands!

619
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,139
Watch out of my car.

620
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:47,184
Don't scratch my Ferrari.

621
00:48:47,185 --> 00:48:49,142
My car!

622
00:48:49,143 --> 00:48:51,929
She gave my Ferrari
to a pizza guy?

623
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,278
What did she say?

624
00:48:54,279 --> 00:48:57,021
Ha... happy birthday.

625
00:48:59,458 --> 00:49:01,242
"Happy birthday."

626
00:49:17,041 --> 00:49:18,956
Let's go.

627
00:49:19,652 --> 00:49:21,218
Hey, this one.

628
00:49:21,219 --> 00:49:23,221
This one. Come.

629
00:49:30,358 --> 00:49:32,316
Ew, Mom, gross.
What are you doing?

630
00:49:32,317 --> 00:49:33,404
Shh!

631
00:49:33,405 --> 00:49:34,840
Hey, guys. What
are you doing here,

632
00:49:34,841 --> 00:49:36,581
Ah, man, we... we
forgot our keys.

633
00:49:36,582 --> 00:49:37,756
Can I just borrow your
flashlight for a second?

634
00:49:37,757 --> 00:49:38,453
What?

635
00:49:38,454 --> 00:49:40,499
Take that.

636
00:49:45,634 --> 00:49:47,375
Get in.

637
00:49:52,772 --> 00:49:54,468
Who are you people?

638
00:49:54,469 --> 00:49:56,905
I mean, you're stealing cars
and he's punching everyone?

639
00:49:56,906 --> 00:49:58,777
Are you really my parents?

640
00:49:58,778 --> 00:50:01,171
Your will for revolution and
change had to come from somewhere.

641
00:50:01,172 --> 00:50:02,563
Get in.

642
00:50:02,564 --> 00:50:03,739
Listen to your mother.

643
00:50:38,861 --> 00:50:40,384
Why didn't you tell
me you were pregnant?

644
00:50:40,385 --> 00:50:42,386
You didn't give me a chance.

645
00:50:42,387 --> 00:50:44,258
What do you mean?

646
00:50:45,259 --> 00:50:47,260
Now's not the time
to rewrite the past.

647
00:50:47,261 --> 00:50:50,394
We need to figure out how to get
us out of this shit you put us in.

648
00:50:50,395 --> 00:50:53,398
- Me? I put you in this?
- Yes.

649
00:50:54,225 --> 00:50:56,922
You clean this up. You
better have a plan.

650
00:50:56,923 --> 00:50:58,490
All right.

651
00:51:02,189 --> 00:51:05,148
That's it? That's
your plan? Sleeping?

652
00:51:05,149 --> 00:51:07,803
No. I think better when I sleep.

653
00:51:08,804 --> 00:51:10,240
Who is going to
believe that things

654
00:51:10,241 --> 00:51:12,155
can be figured out
while sleeping?

655
00:51:12,156 --> 00:51:13,460
You just showed up from nowhere
after 15 years and gave me a mess.

656
00:51:13,461 --> 00:51:14,983
And now I have to fix
all your shitty things.

657
00:51:14,984 --> 00:51:16,624
You better have a plan
when you wake up...

658
00:51:45,928 --> 00:51:48,843
I told you no hospital.

659
00:51:48,844 --> 00:51:50,455
It's safe.

660
00:51:51,325 --> 00:51:52,935
We're in my village.

661
00:51:54,633 --> 00:51:55,720
The fishing village?

662
00:51:55,721 --> 00:51:58,376
Things have changed.

663
00:51:59,594 --> 00:52:02,248
Doctor said you were lucky.
But you lost a lot of blood.

664
00:52:02,249 --> 00:52:04,598
They had to give
you a transfusion.

665
00:52:04,599 --> 00:52:07,559
Lucky for you, your son
has the same blood type.

666
00:52:08,342 --> 00:52:09,865
Raymond.

667
00:52:10,431 --> 00:52:11,998
Where is he?

668
00:52:17,351 --> 00:52:19,136
So he's really my son?

669
00:52:19,701 --> 00:52:21,441
And Kwang's been raising him?

670
00:52:21,442 --> 00:52:24,402
Kwang was around. I
raised him myself.

671
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:28,796
Yeah, well, you didn't
have to, if you'd told me.

672
00:52:28,797 --> 00:52:30,450
The last time I saw you,
you told me to run away.

673
00:52:30,451 --> 00:52:32,931
I didn't tell you to run
to someone like Kwang.

674
00:52:32,932 --> 00:52:35,587
No one else was here for me,
so you don't get to judge.

675
00:52:36,414 --> 00:52:38,850
There are many things you don't
know and you'll never understand.

676
00:52:38,851 --> 00:52:41,158
No, no, no. I
understand completely.

677
00:52:42,028 --> 00:52:43,507
Love your bracelet.

678
00:52:43,508 --> 00:52:46,205
What is it? Tiffany's? Cartier?

679
00:52:46,206 --> 00:52:48,425
Yes, John. You
understand me completely.

680
00:52:48,426 --> 00:52:52,168
I ran to the one person who gave me
the riches and pearls that I deserve.

681
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,822
And Raymond, stop
pretending you're asleep.

682
00:52:54,823 --> 00:52:56,694
You two do anything but fight?

683
00:52:56,695 --> 00:52:57,957
- Yes.
- No.

684
00:52:59,611 --> 00:53:03,049
Mrs. Kwang? Some of our
patients wanna say thank you.

685
00:53:05,225 --> 00:53:06,312
Oh, thank you.

686
00:53:06,313 --> 00:53:07,618
Why all the flowers?

687
00:53:07,619 --> 00:53:09,228
Mrs. Kwang is our
biggest donor.

688
00:53:09,229 --> 00:53:11,230
Actually, the only donor.

689
00:53:11,231 --> 00:53:14,277
Thanks to her, we have the
best hospital in the area.

690
00:53:14,278 --> 00:53:16,279
She saved countless lives.

691
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,846
I have to go.

692
00:53:19,283 --> 00:53:20,762
Let's go.

693
00:53:21,459 --> 00:53:23,024
Yeah, Raymond.

694
00:53:23,025 --> 00:53:24,678
Thank you all.

695
00:53:24,679 --> 00:53:26,246
- Thank you.
- Appreciate it.

696
00:53:57,712 --> 00:53:59,279
Granny?

697
00:54:04,023 --> 00:54:06,851
I left him. I did it.

698
00:54:06,852 --> 00:54:07,939
Mom, who's this?

699
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:09,724
Come here.

700
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:11,943
Raymond!

701
00:54:11,944 --> 00:54:13,902
How much you've grown.

702
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:17,558
My grandmother. Your
great-grandmother.

703
00:54:18,733 --> 00:54:21,082
Granny, we're going
to change our clothes.

704
00:54:21,083 --> 00:54:22,171
Let's go clean up.

705
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,793
Sorry.

706
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:41,843
Whoa.

707
00:54:48,763 --> 00:54:50,460
Mom, is this where you grew up?

708
00:54:50,461 --> 00:54:52,157
I know it's not much.

709
00:54:52,158 --> 00:54:53,680
Are you kidding?
This is awesome.

710
00:54:53,681 --> 00:54:55,379
Why have you never
brought me here before?

711
00:54:55,466 --> 00:54:57,728
Sometimes it's easier
to forget the past.

712
00:54:57,729 --> 00:55:00,949
Get out of those stinky
clothes. Dinner soon.

713
00:55:05,214 --> 00:55:08,173
Hey, uh, do you have some water?

714
00:55:08,174 --> 00:55:10,045
Water?

715
00:55:14,876 --> 00:55:16,400
Fridge?

716
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,581
I see you still know
your way around.

717
00:55:24,582 --> 00:55:26,365
I don't remember this.

718
00:55:26,366 --> 00:55:28,541
Po Po hates Kwang's money too.

719
00:55:28,542 --> 00:55:31,719
But she likes cold
beer more. Change.

720
00:55:54,481 --> 00:55:56,743
Oh. Hi, Joey.

721
00:55:56,744 --> 00:55:58,485
Hi!

722
00:55:59,965 --> 00:56:03,881
Mom, anything else you wanna
tell me about our family?

723
00:56:03,882 --> 00:56:05,578
Say hello to your
cousin, Raymond.

724
00:56:05,579 --> 00:56:07,841
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

725
00:56:07,842 --> 00:56:10,279
- Hi, Po Po.
- Put it there.

726
00:56:11,542 --> 00:56:12,803
You're not eating?

727
00:56:12,804 --> 00:56:14,500
Not until I get some answers.

728
00:56:14,501 --> 00:56:16,372
I just found out that I have
a great-grandmother, a cousin.

729
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:17,982
What else aren't you telling me?

730
00:56:17,983 --> 00:56:21,594
You never talk about family.
You never talk about the past.

731
00:56:21,595 --> 00:56:23,814
I know nothing about
you, both of you.

732
00:56:23,815 --> 00:56:26,469
So please, no more lies.

733
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:28,035
I deserve to know.

734
00:56:28,036 --> 00:56:29,647
He's right.

735
00:56:31,431 --> 00:56:32,954
Fine.

736
00:56:34,652 --> 00:56:36,393
When your mom was young,

737
00:56:36,958 --> 00:56:39,133
I wasn't exactly who you think.

738
00:56:39,134 --> 00:56:41,788
<i>Both my parents died
in fishing accidents,</i>

739
00:56:41,789 --> 00:56:44,138
<i>so Po Po refused to
let me near the water.</i>

740
00:56:44,139 --> 00:56:47,839
So, I have to find
something else to do.

741
00:56:49,362 --> 00:56:50,755
Joey!

742
00:57:00,634 --> 00:57:03,157
- It's dangerous.
- Can you slow down?

743
00:57:03,158 --> 00:57:05,290
Turns out I was a
really good mechanic.

744
00:57:05,291 --> 00:57:07,598
I could do anything with cars.

745
00:57:07,859 --> 00:57:10,991
<i>Which was fun, but not
very useful in the village.</i>

746
00:57:10,992 --> 00:57:13,733
Wash up. Dinnertime.
-[Joey in Chinese] Okay.

747
00:57:13,734 --> 00:57:17,825
Until one day, something
terrible happened.

748
00:57:28,749 --> 00:57:30,489
Put them into my garage.

749
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:32,536
<i>But Po Po was smart.</i>

750
00:57:32,623 --> 00:57:36,452
<i>If she went to the police, they
might arrest the villagers.</i>

751
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:40,718
<i>By hiding the drugs, she
could keep everyone safe.</i>

752
00:57:41,153 --> 00:57:45,853
<i>Until the day the gang
came to get them back.</i>

753
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:04,568
Joey, wake up.

754
00:58:04,655 --> 00:58:07,831
<i>When these men came
to the small villages,</i>

755
00:58:07,832 --> 00:58:10,703
<i>they would not just take
back their merchandise.</i>

756
00:58:10,704 --> 00:58:14,491
<i>They would also take
away all the young girls.</i>

757
00:58:15,013 --> 00:58:17,711
But lucky for me, I could drive.

758
01:00:10,171 --> 01:00:12,086
Ugh!

759
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:17,874
And then what happened?

760
01:00:17,875 --> 01:00:19,832
I was offered a job.

761
01:00:19,833 --> 01:00:21,705
A job? What kind of job?

762
01:00:21,792 --> 01:00:24,228
Only thing I was
good at. Driving.

763
01:00:24,229 --> 01:00:27,057
And then a few years
later, I met your dad.

764
01:00:27,058 --> 01:00:28,406
These are really good dumplings.

765
01:00:28,407 --> 01:00:31,323
John. Your turn.

766
01:00:31,976 --> 01:00:33,890
All right. What
do you wanna know?

767
01:00:33,891 --> 01:00:35,848
How did you two meet?

768
01:00:35,849 --> 01:00:38,198
Can't remember. It
was so long ago.

769
01:00:38,199 --> 01:00:39,636
John. Tell the truth.

770
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:47,861
- It was a work thing.
- What kind of work thing?

771
01:00:49,558 --> 01:00:51,690
I was a cop. A DEA agent.

772
01:00:51,691 --> 01:00:54,519
I was sent over here undercover
to track a drug shipment.

773
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,913
And, uh, I was pretending
to be a client,

774
01:00:56,914 --> 01:00:59,350
following the mule car that
was transporting drugs.

775
01:00:59,351 --> 01:01:02,396
<i>And it turned out that
the driver of the car was</i>

776
01:01:02,397 --> 01:01:04,529
<i>none other than your mother.</i>

777
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:06,270
What?

778
01:01:06,271 --> 01:01:08,359
These are really good dumplings.
-Yeah, they are, huh?

779
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,318
Yeah, you should
get you some more.

780
01:01:10,841 --> 01:01:15,454
Now, she thought I was a competitor
trying to steal her drugs.

781
01:01:15,976 --> 01:01:17,891
<i>Playing hard to get.</i>

782
01:01:18,718 --> 01:01:20,588
<i>I remember her hair
blowing in the wind,</i>

783
01:01:20,589 --> 01:01:22,766
<i>and as soon as our eyes met...</i>

784
01:01:49,923 --> 01:01:51,924
that was it. I was hooked.

785
01:01:51,925 --> 01:01:54,405
No, no, no. That's
not how I remember.

786
01:01:54,406 --> 01:01:55,799
- Oh, yeah?
- No.

787
01:01:55,886 --> 01:01:57,235
Well, how do you remember it?

788
01:01:58,105 --> 01:02:01,152
First, I remember his shoes.

789
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:10,203
Can't really remember his
face. I don't know why.

790
01:02:10,204 --> 01:02:13,991
But, um, I do remember
our first kiss.

791
01:02:18,952 --> 01:02:20,257
You sure that was
our first kiss?

792
01:02:20,258 --> 01:02:22,433
Yes, I remember
it. Why don't you?

793
01:02:22,434 --> 01:02:26,263
- Oof. You're in trouble now.
- No, no, no. Hold on.

794
01:02:26,264 --> 01:02:28,874
Um, okay, I may not
remember our first kiss,

795
01:02:28,875 --> 01:02:31,835
but I definitely
remember our second.

796
01:02:34,272 --> 01:02:35,839
And our third.

797
01:02:38,972 --> 01:02:40,017
And our fourth.

798
01:02:43,237 --> 01:02:45,457
And our fifth.

799
01:02:46,632 --> 01:02:48,633
No. That's our sixth.

800
01:02:48,634 --> 01:02:50,069
No, no.

801
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:52,507
I'm talking about...

802
01:02:55,249 --> 01:02:56,467
our fifth.

803
01:02:56,468 --> 01:02:58,470
Oh, yeah.

804
01:02:59,601 --> 01:03:00,951
How could I forget?

805
01:03:03,997 --> 01:03:07,435
Oh. That one sounds
less romantic.

806
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:10,394
- More dumplings?
- Yeah.

807
01:03:10,395 --> 01:03:13,266
I don't understand. What
happens? Why did you break up?

808
01:03:13,267 --> 01:03:15,879
Some people just... they
can't make up their mind.

809
01:03:15,966 --> 01:03:17,793
Some people care only about
one thing, their career.

810
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:20,317
Yeah, but some people's jobs
are about saving people.

811
01:03:20,318 --> 01:03:22,536
And for some people, that's
easier than raising a family.

812
01:03:22,537 --> 01:03:25,278
It's a little difficult when no one
tells you that you have a family.

813
01:03:25,279 --> 01:03:27,498
Excuses. Weasel out of it.

814
01:03:27,499 --> 01:03:29,108
It's not an excuse!

815
01:03:29,109 --> 01:03:30,457
Whoa, whoa. Guys, guys, guys.
I think I've heard enough.

816
01:03:30,458 --> 01:03:32,372
- It's been a long day.
- Yeah.

817
01:03:32,373 --> 01:03:33,591
Okay.

818
01:03:33,592 --> 01:03:36,987
- Help me clean up.
- Sure, Mom.

819
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:39,511
You too. Please.

820
01:03:40,686 --> 01:03:42,209
Yeah, of course.

821
01:04:02,099 --> 01:04:05,928
Why are you so awesome?
Such a good job.

822
01:04:05,929 --> 01:04:07,712
Thanks.

823
01:04:07,713 --> 01:04:09,235
Hey. You seen your mom?

824
01:04:09,236 --> 01:04:13,457
- Morning to you too.
- Sorry, man. Good morning.

825
01:04:13,458 --> 01:04:15,416
Peel peas there.

826
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:25,686
So, uh... you like cooking?

827
01:04:25,687 --> 01:04:27,079
Not really.

828
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,690
So why are you studying?

829
01:04:30,344 --> 01:04:34,392
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry
to disappoint.

830
01:04:36,829 --> 01:04:40,180
That was a brave thing you
did, stealing the ledger.

831
01:04:40,833 --> 01:04:42,965
Just wanted Kwang to
stop killing dolphins.

832
01:04:42,966 --> 01:04:44,880
Yeah, I hear you.

833
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:47,883
Actually, I saved some fish the
other day. There was this big fire...

834
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:51,626
Dolphins aren't fish. They're
mammals, just like you and me.

835
01:04:52,149 --> 01:04:54,019
Yeah, yeah, of course.

836
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:57,850
Well, these were definitely fish.
You know, that little cute ones.

837
01:04:59,025 --> 01:05:01,287
I interned for
Kwang last semester.

838
01:05:01,288 --> 01:05:03,159
That's when I found out

839
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:06,902
that his fishing boats kill
over 650,000 dolphins a year.

840
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,642
They get caught up in the nets.

841
01:05:08,643 --> 01:05:11,645
And the fishermen actually chop
them up and used them as bait.

842
01:05:11,646 --> 01:05:14,779
Kwang's a piece of shit
dickhead dolphin killer.

843
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:16,999
Hey, hey, watch
your language, kid.

844
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,697
Okay, Dad.

845
01:05:19,567 --> 01:05:21,438
Sorry, I meant John.

846
01:05:21,439 --> 01:05:23,745
Or is it "Agent Lawlor, sir"?

847
01:05:24,268 --> 01:05:26,051
Cut me some slack, huh?

848
01:05:26,052 --> 01:05:28,793
It's not that I
don't wanna be Dad,

849
01:05:28,794 --> 01:05:33,320
it's just, you know, it's
just... this is all new to me.

850
01:05:34,147 --> 01:05:36,802
Yeah, well, I'm not
really an expert either.

851
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:42,373
Pretty good at these
beans, though, huh?

852
01:05:53,384 --> 01:05:55,821
- Stay here.
- All right.

853
01:06:00,086 --> 01:06:02,131
Hey. I've been looking for you.

854
01:06:02,132 --> 01:06:05,308
I was in town getting some
spare parts for the buggy.

855
01:06:05,309 --> 01:06:07,266
We're meant to hide, remember?

856
01:06:07,267 --> 01:06:09,790
Don't worry, I know how to hide.

857
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:13,272
But you, you're the expert.
You're really good at it.

858
01:06:13,273 --> 01:06:16,623
All right, can we, uh, take
some time out for a minute?

859
01:06:16,624 --> 01:06:19,409
There's a lot of details in
your story that are missing.

860
01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:21,280
Just fill me in.

861
01:06:21,281 --> 01:06:24,937
What happened to you after I left?
-My past is mine, not yours.

862
01:06:30,943 --> 01:06:33,205
You know what? Don't tell me.

863
01:06:33,206 --> 01:06:35,425
Just, you know, keep all
your secrets to yourself.

864
01:06:35,426 --> 01:06:37,035
But just know that one day

865
01:06:37,036 --> 01:06:38,297
they will come around and
they will bite you in the ass.

866
01:06:38,298 --> 01:06:40,212
Do you remember the last time?

867
01:06:40,213 --> 01:06:41,648
What?

868
01:06:41,649 --> 01:06:44,174
Do you remember the last
time we saw each other?

869
01:06:44,565 --> 01:06:46,653
Yeah, of course I do.

870
01:06:46,654 --> 01:06:48,874
All I ever do is
remember that night.

871
01:06:49,614 --> 01:06:51,355
- Hey!
- Hey.

872
01:06:58,492 --> 01:07:00,319
I got something
I need to tell...

873
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:02,234
- Oh, sorry.
- No, you first.

874
01:07:02,235 --> 01:07:05,630
No, you go. Yours
sounds more serious.

875
01:07:06,065 --> 01:07:07,588
Mine can wait.

876
01:07:09,112 --> 01:07:10,939
I'm not a buyer.

877
01:07:11,984 --> 01:07:13,289
I'm not even a client.

878
01:07:13,290 --> 01:07:17,032
I'm an undercover agent.

879
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:21,079
I work for the DEA. My
real name is John Lawlor.

880
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:26,607
I was sent here to dig
into Kwang's operation,

881
01:07:27,086 --> 01:07:29,218
figure out the players,
who he's working for,

882
01:07:29,219 --> 01:07:31,089
who's working for him.

883
01:07:31,090 --> 01:07:33,005
The worst part is, uh...

884
01:07:34,789 --> 01:07:36,704
they want me to bring you in.

885
01:07:38,271 --> 01:07:40,534
I... I don't understand.

886
01:07:43,146 --> 01:07:45,017
You were using me?

887
01:07:46,584 --> 01:07:48,063
Yeah.

888
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:49,717
At first I was.

889
01:07:50,588 --> 01:07:52,590
But then I fell
in love with you.

890
01:07:53,286 --> 01:07:54,809
Deeply.

891
01:07:57,290 --> 01:07:59,987
I thought, uh,
when the time came,

892
01:07:59,988 --> 01:08:03,688
I could just protect
you, protect us.

893
01:08:06,125 --> 01:08:07,908
The system is rigged.

894
01:08:07,909 --> 01:08:10,650
They just need someone
to blame, and, uh...

895
01:08:10,651 --> 01:08:12,826
it's never the shark, you know?

896
01:08:12,827 --> 01:08:17,267
It's always the little fish,
and that's not gonna help.

897
01:08:19,051 --> 01:08:20,835
Listen to me. Listen to me.

898
01:08:21,358 --> 01:08:22,793
Listen to me.

899
01:08:22,794 --> 01:08:24,360
You're gonna get up from here,

900
01:08:24,361 --> 01:08:25,796
you're gonna walk
to the bathroom,

901
01:08:25,797 --> 01:08:27,537
you're gonna crawl
out the window.

902
01:08:27,538 --> 01:08:29,495
- No.
- You're gonna take my car,

903
01:08:29,496 --> 01:08:31,758
and you're gonna drive away
from here as fast as you can.

904
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:33,196
Where should I go?

905
01:08:33,283 --> 01:08:35,632
I... Just go wherever.

906
01:08:35,633 --> 01:08:36,937
Wherever you want.

907
01:08:36,938 --> 01:08:39,984
Just disappear, okay? Use cash.

908
01:08:39,985 --> 01:08:42,291
I will scrub your records.
Don't leave a trace.

909
01:08:42,292 --> 01:08:45,904
- No way for anyone to find you.
- How will you find me?

910
01:08:46,470 --> 01:08:48,298
I won't.

911
01:08:54,869 --> 01:08:57,784
- No. No.
- Please. You have to go.

912
01:08:57,785 --> 01:08:59,743
No, John.

913
01:08:59,744 --> 01:09:02,225
No. No.

914
01:09:02,312 --> 01:09:04,792
Joey, please, go. Now.

915
01:09:10,363 --> 01:09:12,626
That's not exactly
how it happened.

916
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:15,325
Well, that's how I remember it.

917
01:09:16,978 --> 01:09:19,416
You never wondered
what my news was?

918
01:09:20,068 --> 01:09:22,158
Never wondered
what I had to say?

919
01:09:30,383 --> 01:09:31,862
Congratulations.

920
01:09:31,863 --> 01:09:33,386
Thank you.

921
01:10:05,244 --> 01:10:06,679
So you knew?

922
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:09,292
You knew you were pregnant
and you didn't tell me?

923
01:10:09,379 --> 01:10:10,640
You said go, get out.

924
01:10:10,641 --> 01:10:12,424
But if I knew...

925
01:10:12,425 --> 01:10:15,297
Then what? You arrest me?

926
01:10:15,298 --> 01:10:16,863
Raymond is born in prison?

927
01:10:16,864 --> 01:10:18,604
- No, thank you.
- So, what, you...

928
01:10:18,605 --> 01:10:20,127
You run to someone like Kwang?

929
01:10:20,128 --> 01:10:22,696
You don't get to
judge my choices.

930
01:10:23,044 --> 01:10:27,310
I did what I had to
do to protect my son.

931
01:10:27,745 --> 01:10:29,441
I sacrificed everything.

932
01:10:29,442 --> 01:10:30,703
So did I.

933
01:10:30,704 --> 01:10:32,052
I sacrificed you.

934
01:10:32,053 --> 01:10:34,491
The one thing in my
life that meant a damn.

935
01:10:40,061 --> 01:10:42,238
Okay, okay.

936
01:10:43,282 --> 01:10:44,805
Fine.

937
01:10:46,198 --> 01:10:48,635
You want to be part
of this family?

938
01:10:48,766 --> 01:10:50,723
- I do.
- You sure?

939
01:10:50,724 --> 01:10:52,247
I'm sure.

940
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:55,380
And no more secrets,
everything out in the open.

941
01:10:55,381 --> 01:10:56,555
I can do that.

942
01:10:56,556 --> 01:10:58,296
If it doesn't work, we stop.

943
01:10:58,297 --> 01:10:59,993
I don't want Raymond
getting hurt.

944
01:10:59,994 --> 01:11:01,952
Neither do I.

945
01:11:01,953 --> 01:11:04,303
And we take it slow.

946
01:11:05,913 --> 01:11:07,828
That's fine by me.

947
01:11:37,118 --> 01:11:38,771
- What?
<i>- The police want</i>

948
01:11:38,772 --> 01:11:41,558
<i>to talk to you about the
shootout at the hotel.</i>

949
01:11:41,949 --> 01:11:44,081
<i>Kwang, this is serious.</i>

950
01:11:44,082 --> 01:11:45,910
<i>What do I tell them?</i>

951
01:12:46,753 --> 01:12:49,102
- Yes.
- See?

952
01:12:49,103 --> 01:12:50,452
That's how it's done.

953
01:12:50,453 --> 01:12:52,236
Knock, wait, then enter.

954
01:12:52,237 --> 01:12:54,586
Good. What's up?

955
01:12:54,587 --> 01:12:56,328
Just looking for John.

956
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:58,416
- Huh?
- You know John.

957
01:12:58,417 --> 01:13:00,244
Tall, grumpy guy, hates smiling,

958
01:13:00,245 --> 01:13:01,854
not dead, not a chef.

959
01:13:01,855 --> 01:13:03,900
Yeah, I'm sorry. Um...

960
01:13:03,901 --> 01:13:06,643
I haven't seen him at all... no.

961
01:13:06,904 --> 01:13:09,558
- You all right, Mom?
- Yes, I'm fine. Yeah.

962
01:13:09,559 --> 01:13:11,255
Why are you looking for John?

963
01:13:11,256 --> 01:13:13,300
I was pretty harsh
on him yesterday.

964
01:13:13,301 --> 01:13:14,998
Just wanted to say sorry.

965
01:13:14,999 --> 01:13:17,217
Don't worry. He's a tough guy.

966
01:13:17,218 --> 01:13:18,610
Yeah, I know.

967
01:13:18,611 --> 01:13:20,569
Still thought he'd
want to hear it though.

968
01:13:20,570 --> 01:13:22,397
He's probably in the mountains,
getting his work out.

969
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:24,748
- Okay. Thanks.
- Yeah.

970
01:13:30,710 --> 01:13:31,971
I do not hate smiling.

971
01:13:31,972 --> 01:13:33,277
- I love smiling.
- Really?

972
01:13:33,278 --> 01:13:34,931
Yeah. Show me.

973
01:13:34,932 --> 01:13:38,021
All right. Well, this is my
"Pizza for dinner" smile.

974
01:13:38,022 --> 01:13:39,588
And this...

975
01:13:39,589 --> 01:13:44,245
is I found passports and
$10,000 in cash smile.

976
01:13:44,768 --> 01:13:46,246
Give me that.

977
01:13:46,247 --> 01:13:47,639
You said no more secrets.

978
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:49,641
Fine. It's our escape plan.

979
01:13:49,642 --> 01:13:52,035
Some traveling cash,
fake passports.

980
01:13:52,036 --> 01:13:53,645
Everything we need to get away.

981
01:13:53,646 --> 01:13:55,517
- Except...
- Except what?

982
01:13:55,518 --> 01:13:58,520
I only have passports
for me and Ray.

983
01:13:58,521 --> 01:14:01,131
Don't worry. We're
not gonna split up.

984
01:14:01,132 --> 01:14:03,177
I'm not gonna lose you again.

985
01:14:08,922 --> 01:14:11,446
This incident at the hotel,

986
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:14,710
six of your bodyguards
were found there.

987
01:14:14,711 --> 01:14:16,233
What time was the incident?

988
01:14:16,234 --> 01:14:19,758
Around, uh, 5, 6 pm.

989
01:14:19,759 --> 01:14:21,804
Hm.

990
01:14:21,805 --> 01:14:24,024
That is hard to explain,

991
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,112
But, Deputy Liu, you know,

992
01:14:26,113 --> 01:14:28,986
this doesn't seem like
any of my concern.

993
01:14:30,509 --> 01:14:34,207
But as you can see, my
employees clocked out at 4 p.m.

994
01:14:34,208 --> 01:14:36,601
and what my employees do
on their personal time

995
01:14:36,602 --> 01:14:39,649
is their business, not mine.

996
01:14:40,388 --> 01:14:42,215
How do we know these are real?

997
01:14:42,216 --> 01:14:44,566
Deputy, the real question
you should be asking is

998
01:14:44,567 --> 01:14:46,872
who killed my poor employees?

999
01:14:46,873 --> 01:14:48,526
Why question me

1000
01:14:48,527 --> 01:14:51,661
when there's a real murderer
running out there free?

1001
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,401
Makes me think of
the Chinese proverb:

1002
01:14:54,402 --> 01:14:57,143
Why kill the chicken
to scare the monkey.

1003
01:14:57,144 --> 01:15:00,146
Are you a chicken or a
monkey, Mister Kwang?

1004
01:15:00,147 --> 01:15:03,410
You know, it sounds to me like
you're dealing with a real pro.

1005
01:15:03,411 --> 01:15:07,024
Someone that is trained
with a unique set of skills.

1006
01:15:07,415 --> 01:15:09,416
You know, if anyone
should be a suspect,

1007
01:15:09,417 --> 01:15:10,635
it's this person, not me.

1008
01:15:10,636 --> 01:15:13,508
You mean the American,
George Washington.

1009
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:15,336
George Washington.

1010
01:15:15,859 --> 01:15:17,948
George Washington...

1011
01:15:19,427 --> 01:15:22,605
Not George Washington!

1012
01:15:25,042 --> 01:15:27,566
Meet Agent John Lawlor.

1013
01:15:27,827 --> 01:15:30,046
My men sacrificed their lives

1014
01:15:30,047 --> 01:15:32,614
trying to stop him from
kidnapping my wife.

1015
01:15:32,615 --> 01:15:34,311
Why would he do this?

1016
01:15:34,312 --> 01:15:38,533
Because this John Lawlor
conceived a child with my wife.

1017
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:40,752
The very child I've
been raising as

1018
01:15:40,753 --> 01:15:43,930
my own son for
the past 13 years.

1019
01:15:46,193 --> 01:15:50,371
His first case here in Taipei
was here to investigate me.

1020
01:15:52,373 --> 01:15:53,940
We will see.

1021
01:15:54,724 --> 01:15:56,290
Please look into it.

1022
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:09,085
Any news?

1023
01:16:09,086 --> 01:16:11,435
Looking everywhere.
Finding nothing.

1024
01:16:11,436 --> 01:16:13,959
Check their airports,
train stations.

1025
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:15,571
All staked out.

1026
01:16:15,962 --> 01:16:17,397
Try her village.

1027
01:16:17,398 --> 01:16:19,749
She said she never go
back, but you never know.

1028
01:16:30,324 --> 01:16:31,847
Listen to me very carefully.

1029
01:16:31,848 --> 01:16:34,066
This is really important, okay?

1030
01:16:34,067 --> 01:16:36,679
Kwang's ledger. Were
there any others?

1031
01:16:36,766 --> 01:16:38,418
I don't know. Maybe.

1032
01:16:38,419 --> 01:16:40,290
I didn't see any other ledgers.

1033
01:16:40,291 --> 01:16:41,770
There's only one.

1034
01:16:41,771 --> 01:16:44,947
He's in control if we
can't find hard evidence,

1035
01:16:44,948 --> 01:16:46,252
Kwang's not smart enough

1036
01:16:46,253 --> 01:16:48,080
to keep all that
information in his head.

1037
01:16:48,081 --> 01:16:50,997
Well, I was in his
study one afternoon.

1038
01:16:51,998 --> 01:16:53,172
Maybe it was the rhino.

1039
01:16:53,173 --> 01:16:55,000
He has a rhino
sculpture on his desk.

1040
01:16:55,001 --> 01:16:56,436
What if it's not a
sculpture at all?

1041
01:16:56,437 --> 01:16:58,395
- It's a hard drive.
- I can go get it.

1042
01:16:58,396 --> 01:16:59,701
No.

1043
01:16:59,702 --> 01:17:01,878
- It'll be easy...
- No.

1044
01:17:03,357 --> 01:17:05,445
- We'll find another way.
- What other way?

1045
01:17:05,446 --> 01:17:08,057
You said it: without any
evidence, Kwang wins.

1046
01:17:08,058 --> 01:17:09,972
We will find one. Don't worry.

1047
01:17:09,973 --> 01:17:11,714
We got this.

1048
01:17:13,541 --> 01:17:16,501
Hey, don't go too far.

1049
01:18:10,337 --> 01:18:12,688
<i>Did you find her?</i>

1050
01:18:13,819 --> 01:18:16,256
- No.
- Then why are you calling me?

1051
01:18:16,604 --> 01:18:18,128
Huh?

1052
01:18:20,783 --> 01:18:22,174
Good boy.

1053
01:18:22,175 --> 01:18:23,262
Don't drink beer that much.

1054
01:18:23,263 --> 01:18:24,742
Your hands are cold.

1055
01:18:24,743 --> 01:18:26,265
- Drink some hot tea.
- No... No beer, no enjoyment.

1056
01:18:26,266 --> 01:18:27,876
It's time to go.

1057
01:18:27,877 --> 01:18:29,530
What's wrong?

1058
01:18:29,922 --> 01:18:31,401
What are you doing?

1059
01:18:31,402 --> 01:18:32,837
No, you promised.

1060
01:18:32,838 --> 01:18:34,578
We're only gonna split
up for a little bit.

1061
01:18:34,579 --> 01:18:37,102
I'll create a secure email for
us to communicate, all right?

1062
01:18:37,103 --> 01:18:39,539
It's a shitty plan, but
it's the only one we have.

1063
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:41,237
- Raymond!
- Po Po, where is Raymond?

1064
01:18:41,238 --> 01:18:42,717
Raymond. Where is Raymond?

1065
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:44,284
Hanging out with his friends.

1066
01:18:45,416 --> 01:18:47,460
- Hi, guys.
- Where's Raymond?

1067
01:18:47,461 --> 01:18:48,897
He took my motorcycle.

1068
01:18:48,898 --> 01:18:50,769
Said he has something to do.

1069
01:19:16,534 --> 01:19:18,275
Hi, Raymond.

1070
01:19:18,536 --> 01:19:20,756
Need another pencil sharpener?

1071
01:19:31,331 --> 01:19:33,769
- <i>Did you find her?</i>
- It's me, Kwang.

1072
01:19:34,073 --> 01:19:36,901
Joey, darling, you okay?

1073
01:19:36,902 --> 01:19:38,598
<i>- They hurt you?</i>
- Where is Raymond?

1074
01:19:38,599 --> 01:19:40,644
You don't have to worry
about Raymond, sweetheart.

1075
01:19:40,645 --> 01:19:41,864
He's here with me.

1076
01:19:41,951 --> 01:19:43,474
<i>He won't escape this time.</i>

1077
01:19:45,389 --> 01:19:48,478
<i>Kwang, it's me, Agent Lawlor.</i>

1078
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:50,393
Agent John Lawlor.

1079
01:19:50,394 --> 01:19:51,916
Nice to finally meet you.

1080
01:19:51,917 --> 01:19:53,309
Kwang, let him go.

1081
01:19:53,310 --> 01:19:55,833
- <i>And what do I get?</i>
- What do you want?

1082
01:19:55,834 --> 01:19:57,575
What do I want...

1083
01:19:58,010 --> 01:19:59,706
What do I want?

1084
01:19:59,707 --> 01:20:01,883
What I want, Agent Lawlor,

1085
01:20:01,884 --> 01:20:06,279
<i>is for you to go away and
leave me and my wife alone.</i>

1086
01:20:07,019 --> 01:20:09,282
Go back to where you came from.

1087
01:20:09,892 --> 01:20:11,893
Okay, then we swap.

1088
01:20:11,894 --> 01:20:13,634
Me for Raymond.

1089
01:20:15,071 --> 01:20:17,681
Ximending District,
American Alley.

1090
01:20:17,682 --> 01:20:19,553
American Alley?

1091
01:20:19,902 --> 01:20:22,033
You sure you don't want
to try some delicious

1092
01:20:22,034 --> 01:20:24,080
Taiwanese food before you go?

1093
01:20:24,254 --> 01:20:25,995
Noon.

1094
01:20:26,996 --> 01:20:28,910
- What are you doing?
- You said you would do anything

1095
01:20:28,911 --> 01:20:30,215
to protect our son. So would I.

1096
01:20:30,216 --> 01:20:31,695
He's going to kill you.

1097
01:20:31,696 --> 01:20:34,220
We'll see about that.

1098
01:20:38,921 --> 01:20:40,138
Trust me.

1099
01:20:40,139 --> 01:20:41,837
Okay? Go.

1100
01:21:41,374 --> 01:21:42,679
Where's Raymond?

1101
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:44,203
He's in the car.

1102
01:21:44,508 --> 01:21:45,551
Mom!

1103
01:21:45,552 --> 01:21:47,380
- No. No. No.
- Mommy.

1104
01:21:48,033 --> 01:21:49,120
Let's go.

1105
01:21:49,121 --> 01:21:50,295
No, that wasn't the deal.

1106
01:21:50,296 --> 01:21:51,819
Deal?

1107
01:21:52,255 --> 01:21:54,387
Don't talk to me
about some deal.

1108
01:21:56,824 --> 01:22:00,350
Joey, remember the
first time we met?

1109
01:22:03,222 --> 01:22:04,789
Oh.

1110
01:22:05,268 --> 01:22:06,834
She didn't tell you.

1111
01:22:08,793 --> 01:22:10,925
Let me tell you about our story.

1112
01:22:31,033 --> 01:22:32,686
Tea?

1113
01:22:39,128 --> 01:22:41,957
Looking for some
lost merchandise.

1114
01:23:00,192 --> 01:23:02,412
Easy! Get your hands off her.

1115
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:11,637
What did you do to her?

1116
01:23:11,638 --> 01:23:13,989
No, don't worry about her.

1117
01:23:14,163 --> 01:23:15,511
Worry about you.

1118
01:23:15,512 --> 01:23:18,297
There are consequences
for what you've done.

1119
01:23:18,732 --> 01:23:21,778
For one, you killed
my best driver.

1120
01:23:21,779 --> 01:23:24,173
Good help is hard
to find these days.

1121
01:23:24,303 --> 01:23:25,695
Sorry.

1122
01:23:25,696 --> 01:23:27,306
I'm sure you are.

1123
01:23:29,830 --> 01:23:31,397
You like?

1124
01:23:32,355 --> 01:23:33,747
Porsche.

1125
01:23:34,096 --> 01:23:37,969
RWB 964 twin turbo.

1126
01:23:40,276 --> 01:23:42,669
Why don't you come work with me?

1127
01:23:43,322 --> 01:23:44,583
What are you gonna do?

1128
01:23:44,584 --> 01:23:46,281
Rot away in this
little fishing village

1129
01:23:46,282 --> 01:23:48,022
for the rest of your life?

1130
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:50,329
You're way too smart,

1131
01:23:50,808 --> 01:23:52,114
beautiful for that.

1132
01:23:54,725 --> 01:23:56,639
- You killed her.
- No,

1133
01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:58,380
- I'm not some kind of...
- Po Po!

1134
01:23:58,381 --> 01:24:01,861
Po Po!

1135
01:24:01,862 --> 01:24:04,603
Shh. Stop. Calm down.

1136
01:24:04,604 --> 01:24:06,170
Calm down.

1137
01:24:06,171 --> 01:24:09,044
Shh...

1138
01:24:10,523 --> 01:24:12,047
It's okay.

1139
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:15,267
Hey.

1140
01:24:20,794 --> 01:24:23,058
See? You can trust me.

1141
01:24:23,493 --> 01:24:24,971
I'll never lie to you.

1142
01:24:24,972 --> 01:24:28,106
I'll always protect you,
you and your family.

1143
01:24:28,846 --> 01:24:31,805
And I'll give you the
life that you deserve.

1144
01:24:32,284 --> 01:24:34,634
We could make a
great team together.

1145
01:24:36,941 --> 01:24:38,943
What do you say, hm?

1146
01:24:39,857 --> 01:24:41,424
Deal?

1147
01:24:49,127 --> 01:24:50,868
It's a new deal. Now.

1148
01:24:55,351 --> 01:24:56,874
Come on.

1149
01:25:21,464 --> 01:25:23,814
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1150
01:25:28,819 --> 01:25:29,994
Get down.

1151
01:25:45,488 --> 01:25:48,143
- Go.
- You sit down!

1152
01:26:07,988 --> 01:26:10,165
You do this to me?

1153
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:13,341
We're supposed to be family.

1154
01:26:13,342 --> 01:26:15,082
You do this to me?

1155
01:26:15,779 --> 01:26:17,171
Huh?

1156
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:19,651
After everything I've
done for both of you?

1157
01:26:19,652 --> 01:26:21,219
You do this to me?

1158
01:26:30,272 --> 01:26:32,403
Everything's gonna be okay.

1159
01:26:32,404 --> 01:26:33,971
We start over.

1160
01:26:40,717 --> 01:26:42,719
We'll be a family again.

1161
01:26:43,807 --> 01:26:45,503
We'll be a family again.

1162
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:47,376
Don't worry.

1163
01:26:54,774 --> 01:26:56,167
You all right?

1164
01:26:56,689 --> 01:26:59,517
Kwang, he still
has the USB drive.

1165
01:26:59,518 --> 01:27:01,607
Stay here.

1166
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:51,266
Get out of the way, man.

1167
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:57,489
Hey, watch out.

1168
01:28:27,650 --> 01:28:30,087
Kwang, hold it there!

1169
01:28:30,261 --> 01:28:31,654
Don't move.

1170
01:28:32,002 --> 01:28:34,657
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

1171
01:28:35,962 --> 01:28:37,660
You are under arrest.

1172
01:28:39,662 --> 01:28:41,140
On the floor now, now.

1173
01:28:41,141 --> 01:28:42,490
No.

1174
01:28:42,491 --> 01:28:44,448
People are leaving.

1175
01:28:44,449 --> 01:28:47,016
It's over, Kwang.
You're under arrest.

1176
01:28:47,017 --> 01:28:50,019
This has nothing to do
with your fishing case.

1177
01:28:50,020 --> 01:28:52,674
- This is between you and me!
- This is nothing personal.

1178
01:28:52,675 --> 01:28:54,458
Of course it is.

1179
01:28:54,459 --> 01:28:57,418
I've waited 15 years for her to
love me, and then you show up.

1180
01:28:57,419 --> 01:29:00,246
What can you give her
that I can't, huh?

1181
01:29:00,247 --> 01:29:02,074
You can't even take
care of your own son.

1182
01:29:02,075 --> 01:29:04,121
I'm just doing my job.

1183
01:29:04,556 --> 01:29:05,991
It's the last time, Kwang

1184
01:29:05,992 --> 01:29:07,384
Get on the fucking floor.

1185
01:29:07,385 --> 01:29:09,343
Go ahead, shoot me. Huh?

1186
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:11,041
I'm unarmed.

1187
01:29:43,813 --> 01:29:46,772
Is this a 3D movie?

1188
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:50,385
They fight for real.

1189
01:29:50,559 --> 01:29:52,648
- Don't watch it.
- Just a bit.

1190
01:30:09,229 --> 01:30:12,668
Oh my, it's too violent!

1191
01:30:48,225 --> 01:30:50,879
- See, I was right.
- About what?

1192
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,663
You want her.

1193
01:30:52,664 --> 01:30:54,056
You're fighting for her.

1194
01:30:54,057 --> 01:30:56,494
But you're gonna
have to kill me.

1195
01:30:56,755 --> 01:30:58,670
'Cause she needs me.

1196
01:30:59,628 --> 01:31:01,456
She needs no one.

1197
01:31:04,154 --> 01:31:07,287
Good fight, I like it.

1198
01:31:32,008 --> 01:31:33,617
<i>In shocking news,</i>

1199
01:31:33,618 --> 01:31:36,402
<i>business tycoon King
Kwang has been arrested</i>

1200
01:31:36,403 --> 01:31:38,622
<i>for illegal possession
of firearms in Taiwan.</i>

1201
01:31:38,623 --> 01:31:41,843
<i>Which has some of the toughest
gun-control law in the world...</i>

1202
01:31:41,844 --> 01:31:43,105
Cigarette?

1203
01:31:43,106 --> 01:31:45,238
Anyone? You got a cigarette?

1204
01:31:46,196 --> 01:31:47,676
Quit smoking.

1205
01:31:47,806 --> 01:31:49,460
You want a lollipop?

1206
01:31:50,069 --> 01:31:51,723
Yeah, all right.

1207
01:31:52,550 --> 01:31:53,681
I made bail?

1208
01:31:53,682 --> 01:31:56,902
Someone wants to see you first.

1209
01:32:06,521 --> 01:32:08,434
Hey, thanks for bailing me out.

1210
01:32:08,435 --> 01:32:10,698
<i>It wasn't me. They
want a million for you.</i>

1211
01:32:10,699 --> 01:32:12,221
<i>Way too much for the agency.</i>

1212
01:32:12,222 --> 01:32:14,615
- Thanks, boss.
<i>- I told you to go on vacation,</i>

1213
01:32:14,616 --> 01:32:16,834
<i>a weekend escape.
Instead, you went rogue.</i>

1214
01:32:16,835 --> 01:32:18,401
<i>You couldn't even
bring the ledger.</i>

1215
01:32:18,402 --> 01:32:20,534
Yeah, well, I got
something better.

1216
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:23,232
All of Kwang's records,
shipping manifests,

1217
01:32:23,233 --> 01:32:26,017
supplies, buyers,
illegal carbon offsets.

1218
01:32:26,018 --> 01:32:27,671
<i>- This is real.</i>
- More than real.

1219
01:32:27,672 --> 01:32:29,194
<i>Okay, let me handle
it from here.</i>

1220
01:32:29,195 --> 01:32:31,980
<i>Until then, you
better disappear.</i>

1221
01:32:31,981 --> 01:32:33,939
<i>For real this time.</i>

1222
01:32:34,244 --> 01:32:36,375
<i>- Vanish. All of you.</i>
- For the weekend?

1223
01:32:36,376 --> 01:32:38,029
<i>Make it a couple of weeks...</i>

1224
01:32:38,030 --> 01:32:39,902
<i>couple of years.</i>

1225
01:32:43,296 --> 01:32:45,124
All right, what's next?

1226
01:32:45,472 --> 01:32:48,606
You leave Taipei, immediately.

1227
01:33:01,793 --> 01:33:04,403
Robin Hood, thank you
for bailing me out.

1228
01:33:04,404 --> 01:33:06,231
- Not, my money.
- Here.

1229
01:33:06,232 --> 01:33:08,626
Thanks. So what
are we doing now?

1230
01:33:08,757 --> 01:33:09,974
Um...

1231
01:33:09,975 --> 01:33:11,062
Family vacation?

1232
01:33:11,063 --> 01:33:12,803
Ooh, yes. Yes.

1233
01:33:12,804 --> 01:33:14,457
No, you still have school.

1234
01:33:14,458 --> 01:33:16,024
Come on, a couple of
days isn't gonna hurt.

1235
01:33:16,025 --> 01:33:17,416
What do they learn
at this age anyway?

1236
01:33:17,417 --> 01:33:19,375
Plus, I already aced
my last math test.

1237
01:33:19,376 --> 01:33:21,072
- No. Nope.
- There you go. Come on.

1238
01:33:21,073 --> 01:33:22,334
This kid has been through a lot.

1239
01:33:22,335 --> 01:33:24,815
Yeah, I'm emotionally
damaged for life.

1240
01:33:24,816 --> 01:33:27,166
Absolutely not.

1241
01:33:28,472 --> 01:33:30,081
I got this. Come on.

1242
01:33:30,082 --> 01:33:32,997
Hey, Joey, listen, I just
got my passport back.

1243
01:33:32,998 --> 01:33:35,478
This is a really nice time for us
to go on our first family trip.

1244
01:33:35,479 --> 01:33:36,784
- No.
- Come on!

1245
01:33:36,785 --> 01:33:38,873
Come on, you're
such a taskmaster.

1246
01:33:38,874 --> 01:33:40,701
I miss school, months at a time.

1247
01:33:40,702 --> 01:33:41,832
Look how I turn out.

1248
01:33:41,833 --> 01:33:44,531
How you turned out... Huh...

1249
01:34:00,069 --> 01:34:01,897
You like it?

1250
01:34:02,201 --> 01:34:03,855
<i>Oui.</i>

1251
01:34:05,944 --> 01:34:07,292
Come on, Ray.

1252
01:34:07,293 --> 01:34:08,859
Ease up on the photos.

1253
01:34:08,860 --> 01:34:10,862
We have 13 years of empty
scrapbooks to fill in.

1254
01:34:10,993 --> 01:34:14,039
Oh, that's for
me. I'll get it.

1255
01:34:15,562 --> 01:34:17,739
- I have some...
- I got something I want to...

1256
01:34:17,826 --> 01:34:21,090
No, it's okay. You first.
This time you first for sure.

1257
01:34:21,394 --> 01:34:23,614
I have a present for you.

1258
01:34:25,485 --> 01:34:27,923
Now you cannot say
you didn't know.

1259
01:34:33,885 --> 01:34:37,280
Wow, that was... fast.

1260
01:34:38,498 --> 01:34:41,284
How can you? I mean...

1261
01:34:41,937 --> 01:34:43,981
You sure?

1262
01:34:43,982 --> 01:34:45,592
What...

1263
01:34:45,984 --> 01:34:47,464
Is it...

1264
01:34:47,725 --> 01:34:49,684
- Is it...
- Is it yours?

1265
01:34:52,338 --> 01:34:53,905
Does it matter?

1266
01:34:56,125 --> 01:34:57,692
No.

1267
01:35:03,610 --> 01:35:05,176
