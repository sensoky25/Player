Champagne.

5
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:14,347
Traveling to Taipei, Taiwan.
We are happy to...

6
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:52,544
Grab the guns.

7
00:41:03,587 --> 00:41:04,462
You guys got the wrong room!

8
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:10,482
Stairs!

9
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:35,108
Stop him!

10
00:45:45,034 --> 00:45:47,203
Get in the car!
Go after that Ferrari!

11
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:26,571
Sports car? So what!!
What is wrong with you?!

12
00:48:39,459 --> 00:48:43,337
Get out of the car! Get out of the car!
Get out of the car!

13
00:48:43,338 --> 00:48:44,797
Hands!

14
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:47,383
Believe me! It’s my Bobo.

15
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:48,718
Bobo!

16
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:12,194
Sleep can help come up with solutions!?
Only ghost will believe you!

17
00:51:12,195 --> 00:51:14,279
Haven’t seen in decades
and you left me a mess!

18
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,990
Now, have to clean it for you!

19
00:53:05,975 --> 00:53:06,601
Thank you!

20
00:53:13,816 --> 00:53:14,442
Thank you, everyone.

21
00:54:04,367 --> 00:54:06,702
I left him. I did it!

22
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:11,582
Raymond!

23
00:54:12,792 --> 00:54:13,918
You grew so big now!

24
00:54:19,048 --> 00:54:20,841
Grandma,
we are going to get changed.

25
00:57:11,303 --> 00:57:13,096
Joey!
Come and have lunch!

26
00:57:13,097 --> 00:57:14,056
Okay.

27
00:57:29,321 --> 00:57:30,698
Put all these in my garage.

28
00:58:02,313 --> 00:58:04,106
Joey! Get up and run!

29
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:06,051
You did a really good job
deshelling them.

30
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:07,301
Thank you.

31
01:04:07,302 --> 01:04:08,220
Really good.

32
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:14,893
Go over there
and deshell the beans.

33
01:18:22,115 --> 01:18:24,157
Don’t drink so much cold beers.
Your hands are so cold

34
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:25,827
Feels awful if I do not drink!

35
01:18:41,592 --> 01:18:42,593
Where is Raymond?

36
01:18:43,052 --> 01:18:44,053
He went out with Biao.

37
01:27:36,168 --> 01:27:37,044
Let's go, quickly!

38
01:31:32,321 --> 01:31:34,573
A shocking news for you...

39
01:31:34,823 --> 01:31:36,783
Business Tycoon...

40
01:35:03,782 --> 01:35:04,574
Good morning!

41
01:35:05,534 --> 01:35:06,868
Ma'am, croissants?
