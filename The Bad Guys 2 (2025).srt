3
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,542
Your breakfast, Mr. Soliman.

4
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,919
I don't care about cantaloupe!

5
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,088
Tastes like melon! -It will
never happen again, I promise.

6
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,840
- Yalla, habibi, come back!
- Just going to clean up.

7
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:33,217
- I'll be very fast.
- I'm not done yelling at you!

8
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,735
Unit two, I've lost camera four.

9
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:52,486
We need eyes
on the rooftop terrace.

10
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,572
I'm in.
Okay, Mr. Shark, you're up.

11
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:55,906
SHARK
Nice work, rookie.

12
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,783
- I'm on my way.
- Yasmin told me

13
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,785
- I need to be more attentive.
- What?

14
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,620
You are very attentive.

15
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,665
I know. That's what I told her.

16
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,125
Yalla, did you get a haircut?

17
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,626
I did.

18
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,171
- Thank you for noticing.
- It's very nice.

19
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:11,380
All clear on the roof.

20
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,757
GUARD 2
Copy that.

21
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:13,799
Uh, that was me.

22
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,259
- It-It's still Shark.
- Yeah, no.

23
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,719
I got that. Thank you.

24
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,680
All right,
Mr. Piranha, go crazy.

25
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:29,148
Mr. Snake, that's your cue.

26
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,524
Hope your timing's right, kid.

27
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,152
Snake, be nice to the rookie.

28
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,695
It's her first heist.

29
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,323
I was being nice.
It's just how I sound.

30
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,200
Welcome to the team.

31
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:40,326
See?

32
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,660
All right.

33
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,329
We finished, uh,
with the banter?

34
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,413
Let's do this.

35
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,248
Come on. Five.

36
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,000
- Four.
- Three.

37
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,293
- Two.
- One.

38
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,128
It's showtime.

39
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:13,819
Hello, Mr. Soliman.

40
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,698
The Bad Guys!

41
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,033
Remind me again:

42
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,660
Why didn't you just
come through the front door?

43
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:25,037
- Where's the fun in that?
- He loves an entrance.

44
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,248
Stay back, you... you monsters!

45
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:29,083
Monsters?

46
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,501
Wow.

47
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:32,002
- Did he just say "monsters"?
- He did.

48
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,295
I wouldn't have done that.

49
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,215
You like monsters?

50
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,926
I'll show you a monster, pal.

51
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:52,232
No, no, no, no, no, no.
P-Please.

52
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,901
- Whoa.
- Okay, I see you.

53
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,778
Check this out. -No, no.
No, no, please. Mr. Wolf.

54
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:01,282
Oh, baby, where have you been
all my life?

55
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:02,575
No! No!

56
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,410
- No, no.
- Not bad. Not bad.

57
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,078
This is... this is
a one-of-a-kind prototype.

58
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,496
Shiny!

59
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,998
Wait. We did all this
for a car? -

60
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:13,961
Listen, kid, the heist is never
really about the loot, okay?

61
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,714
- It's a power move, baby.
- -Let's go.

62
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,591
I-I have to say--
No, no. No, this--

63
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,342
It's never been driven!

64
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,052
Don't worry.

65
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,096
We brought you
a little parting gift.

66
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,599
We're classy like that.

67
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,434
For me?

68
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,439
Nice.

69
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,942
Ooh, you say
the naughtiest things.

70
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,205
No! No!

71
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:51,415
You Bad Guys will never
get away with this!

72
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,471

00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:06,639

Nice carbon footprint, jackass!

00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,326
Classy.

140
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,333
Come on. Easy, now. Easy, easy.

141
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,211
Come on, girl. You got this.

142
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,505
Ugh.

143
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:33,679
Oh, hey. Look who it is.

144
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,930
Get over here.

145
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,015
Where you been
keeping yourselves?

146
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,350
Me?

147
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,144
Oh, terrific.

148
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,478
Fantastic.

149
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,813
I mean,
not everyone believes it,

150
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:46,358
but, uh, the Bad Guys went good.

151
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,985
I'll spare you the details,

152
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,821
but in a nutshell,
we felt the wag of doing good.

153
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,197
Made a couple of new friends...

154
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,240
Diane?

155
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,200
You're the Crimson Paw?

156
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,578
We took down Marmalade,
a real bad guy.

157
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,163
The Crimson Paw!

158
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,749
Me? No, no, no.
She's the Crimson Paw.

159
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,958
And surprised everyone

160
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,418
by turning ourselves in.

161
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,336
Yeah, we had a pretty good run
as bad guys,

162
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,338
but sometimes you got
to give up the thing you know

163
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,632
in order to find
something better.

164
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,218
So here we are,
law-abiding citizens

165
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,262
starting over
with a clean slate,

166
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:20,602
and we cannot wait for society
to welcome us with open arms.

167
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:27,107
And-and now you want to work,
uh, at-at a bank?

168
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,735
Why not? Some of
my best memories are at banks.

169
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,658
Uh, you robbed us three times.

170
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,494
That was this bank?

171
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:42,247
It says here that you saved the
city from an evil guinea pig,

172
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,083
but aren't you
a notorious criminal?

173
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,543
Yes. No.

174
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,795
M-Maybe?

175
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,255
Sor... Sorry, nerves.

176
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:53,091
I-I mean, I-I can also do
a great tuna impression.

177
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,260
It's like you're talking
to a tuna, right?

178
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,222
Well, I'm proficient
in Unix, Linux, Windows, Mac

179
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,390
and fluent
in 87 coding languages,

180
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,309
so, yeah, I'm qualified.

181
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,393
I see.

182
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,770
And, um, how do you explain

183
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,647
this gap
in your employment history?

184
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,440
Uh...

185
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,900
My salary expectations?

186
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,902
Wow. That's a good question.

187
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:14,279
No one's ever given me money
on purpose before.

188
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,697
"Great at Secret Santa"?

189
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,282
Yeah. How does that...

190
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,326
W-W-Wait. Don't tell me.

191
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,746
Bath bomb. Lavender.

192
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:25,791
And how would you react if you
saw a coworker doing something

193
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,126
that violates company policy?

194
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,796
Snitches get stitches
and sleep with the fishes.

195
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,089
You know what? Can I act--

196
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,758
Can I get another chance
at that one?

197
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,510
I think we got
everything we need.

198
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:38,887
- So great to meet you.
- Thanks for coming in.

199
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:42,850
Uh, we're gonna...
we're gonna pass.

200
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:46,603
Uh, look, Craig,
anyone who wants to change

201
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,480
needs to start somewhere, right?

202
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,900
So I'm just asking for a chance.

203
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,819
Just a chance.

204
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,196
Please?

205
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,782
You know what, Mr. Wolf?

206
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,075
I might-- you know, I might,

207
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,493
I might have
something here for you.

208
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,828
I'm gonna give you a call.

209
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,663
Gee. R-Really?

210
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,582
Craig, that's great!

211
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,500
Number's on my résumé there.

212
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,295
- Okay. Uh...
- And this has been just great.

213
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:12,713
- You can let go now.
- Sorry.

214
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:14,006
I didn't mean to...

215
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,885
I got a job!
This is fantastic, man.

216
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,346
Oh, by the way, Craig,
uh, you know...

217
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,350
Ah.

218
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,020
Yeah. Got it.

219
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,378
...to a better future.

220
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,590
In three weeks, my next-gen
MoonX rocket will blast off

221
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:58,926
and deploy the Power Cell X3.

222
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,218
That's right.

223
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,596
Free wireless charging
from outer space

224
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,598
directly to your phone.

225
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,725
- You're welcome, world.
- Hey, guys. -Hey! -Wolfie.

226
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,518
Wolf! So you got the job?

227
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,812
Well, I mean,
it's not a hundred percent,

228
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,940
but he said,
he said he'd call me.

229
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,275
Well, you did better
than Piranha.

230
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,402
I thought I was supposed
to project confidence.

231
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,029
Yeah, but why a tuna?

232
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,447
What? Tunas are confident.

233
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,407
What tuna do you know
that's not confident?

234
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,492
All of them.

235
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,077
- Tunas are confident.
- Right?

236
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,245
Guys, come on.
Life's like a car chase.

237
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,789
You know what I mean?
There's-there's gonna be

238
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,249
bumps in the road, but
when has that ever stopped us?

239
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,376
Never.

240
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,169
It's just gonna take
a little time,

241
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,546
but I promise you,
people will come around.

242
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,466
Even if we get framed for the
Phantom Bandit's crime spree?

243
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,759
That's awfully specific.

244
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,886
Who's the Phantom, uh-- Who?

245
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,222
You haven't heard?
It's all over the news.

246
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:47,140
There's a battle
of survival for the bil--

247
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:50,102
The Phantom Bandit hit
three locations yesterday,

248
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,437
stealing several
priceless artifacts.

249
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,983
The Phantom is known
for being impossible to trace,

250
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,653
but this time,
he left a calling card.

251
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,197
Wait, hey, hey!
That's our move.

252
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,615
Exactly.

253
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,867
Commissioner, are the Bad Guys
back to a life of crime,

254
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,744
or are they being framed?

255
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,580
Just like your face
with those fabulous bangs!

256
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,124
Thank you. I cut them myself.

257
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,626
Look, I cannot comment
on an ongoing investigation,

258
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:18,422
but let's just say:
once a con, always a con.

259
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:21,550
- So it's the Bad Guys?
- I said no comment!

260
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:22,926
- Come on.
- What?

261
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,469
How are we supposed
to get a fresh start

262
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,929
when we get blamed for
every bad thing that happens?

263
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,394
Hey, guys.

264
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:35,022
Isn't the sun
particularly radiant today?

265
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,816
- What are you wearing?
- What are you drinking?

266
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,277
Wheatgrass kombucha
with extra moss

267
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:43,280
and two shots
of cold-pressed dandelion.

268
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:47,659
Uh, I don't think you're
supposed to eat those things.

269
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,369
Aw, you guys.

270
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,538
I wish I could trade
lighthearted japes

271
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:54,541
with you all night,
but I'm late for vinyasa.

272
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,835
- Vinyasa?
- W-W-Wait. You're going out?

273
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,170
But y-you just got back.

274
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,796
You know how it is.

275
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,507
You think I got this body
by sitting around, watching TV?

276
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,843
- Okay, ew.
- Oh, and don't wait up for me.

277
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,428
It's lucha night.

278
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:09,556
Well, bye...!

279
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,688
Guys, I think
the kombucha ate his brain.

280
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:20,692
Hey, you know what?
As long as he's happy, right?

281
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,903
- And you're not?
- I'd be happier

282
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:25,864
if I could land
one of these jobs.

283
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,825
- First impressions
are hard to shake.

284
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:29,910
Ooh, that was quick.

285
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:32,162
I mean, when I first met you,

286
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:35,415
I thought you were arrogant,
self-satisfied,

287
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,875
dishonest...

288
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,294
...greedy, for sure.

289
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:42,380
Oh, yeah?
What changed your mind?

290
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,548
What do you mean?

291
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,134
Ha ha ha. Very funny.

292
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,552
Seriously, it's hard

293
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,221
to stay positive
when we keep getting rejected.

294
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,890
It makes you feel--
I don't know-- hopeless.

295
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,392
Mm.

296
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:57,562
I mean, going good was the
hardest thing that I ever did.

297
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,816
And compared to you guys,
I had it easy.

298
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:04,277
No one ever knew
I was the Crimson Paw.

299
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,571
I'm sorry,
did you say you were the

300
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,282
Crimson Paw?!

301
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:10,575
Sorry.

302
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,577
I didn't quite catch that.

303
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:17,082
Okay, you asked for it.

304
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,417
You're about to discover
why they call me

305
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,921
the Big Bad Wo--

306
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,636
I think I got carried away.

307
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:33,682
I don't think this is gonna
help my-- with my interviews.

308
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:36,810
I don't know. I think it's cute.

309
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:39,104
- Gives you character.
- Oh.

310
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:43,483
Do I have a concussion, or is
the governor flirting with me?

311
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,195
- Can't it be both?
- Hmm.

312
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,030
- Uh, uh...
- Oh, uh...

313
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,031
- Sorry, I shouldn't have...
- Oh, no, no, no.

314
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,449
I-I didn't really, um...

315
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,535
Uh, yeah, 'cause
you're the governor,

316
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:55,078
- and I'm, you know.
- An-an ex-con.

317
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,955
- Yeah.
- I know.

318
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,165
It's optics.

319
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,749
- Totally.
- Let's just...

320
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,335
- Yeah, let's keep it friendly.
- ...keep it friendly.

321
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,129
- Medium friendly?
- Yeah.

322
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,255
- Madam Governor.
- Oops.

323
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:06,923
Madam Governor.

324
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,926
Sorry to interrupt
you and your acquaintance...

325
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,469
Finally, she remembers my name.

326
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,096
...but you've got the
children's hospital fundraiser

327
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,639
in 20 minutes.

328
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,391
- I'll be right there, Maureen.
- Oh, good. Thank you.

329
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,226
Another fundraiser?

330
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,644
Oof, look at you.

331
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,646
Same time next week?

332
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,983
My calendar's wide open.

333
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,943
Hey.

334
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:30,363
I know it's tough,
but you can't lose hope, okay?

335
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,365
People do want to trust you.

336
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:35,077
You just have to give them
a reason.

337
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,162
Promise?

338
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,872
Governor's word.

339
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:43,001
But until then, I would work
on that right hook.

340
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:46,463
It feels a little like I'm
getting kissed by a butterfly.

341
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:48,131
Catch you later, tough guy.

342
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,758
I was holding back.

343
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:04,814
Huh.

344
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,983
"Give them a reason."

345
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,236
No!

346
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,029
I said no comment!

347
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,491
I want answers.

348
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:17,035
Get me security footage,
scour the phone logs,

349
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,995
and where's my coffee?!

350
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,413
- Uh, Commissioner?
- Not now!

351
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,332
- But you have a visitor.
- They can wait.

352
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,583
Uh, but he's, uh...

353
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:24,501
Hey-hey, Chief!

354
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,711
Can I just say:

355
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,546
love the bangs.

356
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,924
First off,
it's "Commissioner" now.

357
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:32,175
And second...

358
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,760
Ooh, nice.
What's the difference?

359
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,429
Well, the chief is the top
uniformed officer, whereas--

360
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,057
Why am I explaining this
to you?!

361
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,393
Did you touch my board?

362
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,145
- My board. My beautiful board.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

363
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,148
I thought I heard it say,
"Solve me."

364
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,234
- Wolf.
- Listen.

365
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:52,070
I think we're both having
an optics problem.

366
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,530
You need to show the world

367
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,282
you've got this investigation
under control,

368
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:57,284
and we need
to show the world we're good.

369
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:59,327
If I help you catch the Bandit,
it's a win-win.

370
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,578
I'm calling the governor.

371
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,164
Go ahead.
It was basically her idea.

372
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,833
Look at this.

373
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:08,086
Each of the robberies occurred
within a three-minute window.

374
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,255
- So?
- Three minutes is the loop rate

375
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,923
of most standard
security consoles,

376
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,633
which means whoever did this...

377
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:16,594
Patched into security
from the inside.

378
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,929
Bingo.

379
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,472
Fine.

380
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:22,934
Let's say they did.
How would we even trace that?

381
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,855
We'd need some kind of
high-tech computer expert.

382
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,190
They'd have had to clone the IP
address and redirect the feed

383
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,776
to a four gigahertz
dummy console, duh.

384
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,861
Huh?

385
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,612
Your Bandit is clever

386
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,489
but not as clever
as he thinks he is.

387
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,660
However, he'd still need
an inside man.

388
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:42,454
Hmm.

389
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,122
Hey.

390
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,290
Hold this.

391
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,917
Hmm.

392
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,170
There!

393
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:51,463
But that's just the janitor.

394
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,506
Perhaps to the untrained eye,

395
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,842
but if he's really
just the janitor,

396
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:59,137
why is he pushing around
an empty bucket?

397
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,930
Hmm?

398
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:04,726
So the real question is:
How did he get in?

399
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,439
I'd come this way, jam the fan,

400
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,191
pop the grate,
and bam, you're in.

401
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,485
Ooh, ugh.

402
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,111
Why is there pickles in this?

403
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,489
Because that's my lunch.

404
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,240
Who said you could eat my lunch?

405
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,492
Well, he said there was lunch.

406
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,410
Chief, come on. Let's focus.

407
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,454
So we know when and we know how.

408
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:26,831
The real question is why.

409
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,004
Well, why don't you call
some more people

410
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,464
to barge in and help?

411
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:35,840
Ooh!

412
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,843
SNAKE
Welcome, friend,

413
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,470
to Mr. Snake's voicemail.

414
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,097
Today's advice for the soul:

415
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,599
We must stop concentrating
on our differences

416
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,061
and look for
what we have in common.

417
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:49,813
- Namaste.
- Ugh.

418
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:51,523
Bye...!

419
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,650
Is he possessed?

420
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:55,235
Ugh, don't even get me started.

421
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:57,654
I mean, one day he's going
to yoga, he's doing pottery.

422
00:19:57,655 --> 00:19:59,447
I mean, who does pottery,
the cast of Ghost?

423
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,990
Guys, guys, guys, guys. Hold on.

424
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,534
- Huh?
- What'd he say again?

425
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,538
"Look for what we have
in common."

426
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,331
Look. It's not about
the artifacts.

427
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,083
It's about
what they have in common.

428
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:13,128
They're all made from a rare
metal called MacGuffinite.

429
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,212
Of course.

430
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,005
Uh, MacGuff-a-what, now?

431
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,715
Um, sounds kind of made-up.

432
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,176
So does the word "gold"
if you didn't know it was real.

433
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,594
Say "gold."

434
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,638
- Gold. Gold. -Gold. Gold.
- Gold. Gold. -Gold. Gold.

435
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,306
- Gold.
- Gold. -Gold.

436
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,933
That does sound made-up.

437
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,686
Oh, now I can't stop thinking
how it sounds weird. Gold.

438
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,688
So now that we know
what the Bandit is after...

439
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:34,774
We can figure out
where he's gonna strike next!

440
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,735
There you go.
That's the chief I know.

441
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,779
Mmm. You grinding
your own beans these days?

442
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,407
It's "Commissioner."

443
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:43,992
Now get out of my office.

444
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,036
Yeah!

445
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,746
♪ Shake your groove thing ♪

446
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,498
♪ Shake your groove thing,
yeah, yeah... ♪

447
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,335
Next thing you know,
we're on TV getting medals.

448
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,254
Naming streets after us.

449
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,131
Piranha Street, baby.

450
00:20:58,132 --> 00:20:59,674
Hey, listen to this.

451
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,218
Translated into English,
the word "MacGuffinite" means

452
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,262
"a small MacGuffin." Cute.

453
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,599
Okay. Not super helpful,
but, uh, what else you got?

454
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,226
The most famous
MacGuffinite object is

455
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,020
the Belt of Guatelamango.

456
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:15,315
Did you say
the Belt of Guatelamango?

457
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,609
- You heard of that?
- Heard of it?

458
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,902
It's the championship trophy

459
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:21,279
for the Lords of Lucha
tournament.

460
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,697
Uh-oh.

461
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,865
Wait, isn't that
where Snake is going tonight?

462
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,325
That's right.

463
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:27,869
Can you imagine him
at a wrestling match?

464
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,246
- He hates crowds.
- And loud music.

465
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,789
And flamboyant costumes.

466
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,958
And things
that make life worthwhile.

467
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:42,342
Oh, no.

468
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:43,844
Ow!

469
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,349
It's Snake!

470
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,059
It's all right here.

471
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:55,146
Happy hour. Pottery. Yoga.

472
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,023
All the same times
as the Bandit's robberies.

473
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,484
He's been lying to us
this whole time.

474
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,528
Ooh, he's such a little snake.

475
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,905
- That's why he's so happy.
- Oh.

476
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:05,698
Vinyasa, my butt.

477
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,951
If he gets caught,
he's going back to prison.

478
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:10,495
We got to find him before
Police Chief cracks the case.

479
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,748
Uh-oh.

480
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:17,168
Hello?

481
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:21,381
Guess who has two thumbs, bangs
and cracked the case?

482
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:24,133
- This gal!
- Oh, really?

483
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,885
It's going down tonight

484
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,054
at the Lords of Lucha
tournament. -

485
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,765
I am gonna catch
that Bandit red-handed.

486
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,642
I got to say, well done, Wolf.

487
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:34,812
Well done.
You have exceeded my...

488
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:40,108
- Bro, that was our only phone!
- What the thorax?

489
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:41,859
I don't know. I panicked!

490
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,237
Guys, there's only
one play here:

491
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:45,405
find our friend and...

492
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:47,699
Tear him apart limb by limb

493
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,119
until all he can remember
is pain!

494
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,122
Wow, okay.
I was gonna say save him,

495
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:56,499
but, sure, if there's time,
we can do the limb thing.

496
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,386
Ladies and gentlemen,

497
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,138
put your hands together

498
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:14,726
for the current
reigning world champion,

499
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:19,188
Handsome Jorge!

500
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,734
Ha ha! Yes!

501
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,570
Face of an angel.
Punch of el diablo.

502
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:26,863
Ha! Ha!

503
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,708
Snake!

504
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:41,879
I'm gonna kill you!

505
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,139
Wow.

506
00:23:57,895 --> 00:24:01,440
And Mama said
I'd never get to heaven.

507
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:04,151
Look at me now, Mama!

508
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,946
I'm gonna need
a lot of mustard.

509
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,865
Piranha, check it out.

510
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,076
One in your size
and one in my size!

511
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:14,452
Guys, we can shop later.

512
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,120
Right now, we need to find
Snake. Let's go. Come on.

513
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,580
Ooh. Right, right, right,
right, right.

514
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,374
- It's just so much!
- Now, listen.

515
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,875
He could be anywhere.

516
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,585
Webs, search the upper deck.
I'll look ringside.

517
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:23,920
- You two...
- Guys!

518
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:25,922
I can't believe
you came all this way

519
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:27,298
just to see me arrest the Band--

520
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,968
- What? What was that?
- I don't know.

521
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,471
I panicked, okay?
I'm a panicker.

522
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,312
Okay, no more panicking.

523
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,190
Webs, search the upper deck.
You two, backstage.

524
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:47,026
Remember, we're dealing
with a master of deception

525
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,612
who can move like water
and vanish like smoke.

526
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,865
- He could be anywhere...
- There he is.

527
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,118
- Snake!
- Huh?

528
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:58,705
We know everything!

529
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:00,289
What? How did you find out?

530
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,834
Ow!

531
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:05,712
Snakey Cakes?

532
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:07,631
Huh?

533
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,050
Uh...

534
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,844
If I knew you were
expecting friends,

535
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,262
I would've gotten more nachos.

536
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,180
Because, well, I know
you don't like to share.

537
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,098
That's true.

538
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,350
- Unless it's kisses.
- Mmm.

539
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,727
Then he likes to share,

540
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:22,437
- don't you, Snakey Wakey?
- Oh, yeah.

541
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:31,070
Guys, this is Susan.

542
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,114
Hey.

543
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,950
Is she your hostage?

544
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,201
No!

545
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,203
She's my girlfriend.

546
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,086
She called him Snakey Cakes!

547
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:51,007
Huh. So these are the roommates.

548
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:52,383
Roommates?

549
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,635
Did you say "roommates"?

550
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,804
Hey, I'm pulling
your whiskers, Whiskers.

551
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,223
Snakey here told me
all about you guys.

552
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,809
Wait, wait. I'm-I'm just
trying to do the math here.

553
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,645
You're with Snake on purpose?

554
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,775
Well, you talk pretty tough
for a mango with teeth.

555
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:11,861
What? Is that what I look like?

556
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:14,238
Ooh, she is spicy. I like it.

557
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,740
Insult me next.

558
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,246
Are you ready to dance?

559
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:30,171
Another victory
for Handsome Jorge!

560
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,089
CROWD
Jorge! Jorge!

561
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,801
No one can defeat
my handsomeness.

562
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:37,845
And now bring down

563
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:41,849
the Belt of Guatelamango!

564
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,392
Oh, my gosh! It's the belt!

565
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:46,271
Give me the belt!
Give me that belt! I love it!

566
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,273
Wait a minute. Fans...

567
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:53,861
Can it be?

568
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:57,281
Yes! It looks like
we have a new challenger!

569
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:03,412
Someone has
a death wish big enough

570
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:05,957
to take on Handsome Jorge!

571
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,917
CROWD
Jorge! Jorge!

572
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:10,795
Jorge! Jorge! Jorge!

573
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,715
Of course.

574
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,968
What better way to steal
the belt than to win it?

575
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:19,096
That's the Phantom Bandit!

576
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:23,933
Ha ha.
So, you want that belt, huh?

577
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:25,560
We got to expose him.

578
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:27,270
How are we supposed to do that?

579
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:28,688
We improvise.

580
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:30,773
Well, come and get it, pig--

581
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,817
Wow!

582
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,652
He means business!

583
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:35,653
Yeah!

584
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,738
C-C-Can we talk about this?

585
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,954
This is wrestling at its best!

586
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:47,040
Not the face.

587
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:54,381
I didn't really think
that through.

588
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,967
Uh-oh.

589
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:04,015
Huh?

590
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:06,517
Whoo.

591
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:12,023
You ever been deboned
by a chicken?

592
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:15,818
Who's ready for some violence?!

It's the Phantom Bandit.

She came here to steal
the... the...

621
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:45,032
belt?

622
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,868
Good luck getting
out of this one, Bad Guys.

00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:48,911
Huh?

Uh-oh.

Let's get them!

628
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:02,008

Uh-oh.

00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,972

- Wolf!

640
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,188
Get in!

641
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:58,898
You heard the bird. Get in!

642
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:04,070
Go, go!

643
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:11,494
Wow, that was close.

644
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:16,457
Stop this truck now!

645
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,126
Hold on, folks!

646
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:24,298
Wolf!

647
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,926
Sorry.

Isn't she great?

649
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:38,020
Bad Guys.

650
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,565
I'm getting too old for this.

651
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,235
All units. All units.

652
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:46,403
Suspects are headed east
in a hot dog truck.

OFFICER 2
Can you be more specific?

654
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,825
Um, it looks to be all beef,
possibly chorizo.

655
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:53,744
I need birds in the sky,
roadblocks every five miles.

656
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,413
I want eyes on every motel,
greasy spoon,

657
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,666
gas station, bus station,
cattle station, mole hole,

658
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:01,710
vole hole and watering hole
within 80 miles.

659
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:02,753
Let's go!

660
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,423
Now it's personal.

661
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,641
They fell for it.
Just like you planned, boss.

FEMALE VOICE
Good. Let's go.

663
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:39,123
Well, that went sideways.

664
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:41,292
Susan, you were amazing.

665
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:43,627
Where'd you learn
to drive like that? -

666
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,337
I used to deliver pizzas.

667
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,965
Got canned for being too fast.

668
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,884
Cool.

669
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,428
- Your breath stinks.
- What?

670
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:53,971
What do you brush
your teeth with, sardines?

671
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,140
That's a burn.

672
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,808
I don't brush my teeth
with anything.

673
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,310
Shocking. Uh...

674
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,103
That's kind of bad.

675
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,646
I'm surprised
you hang out with me.

676
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,523
- How about a mint?
- Ooh. That's clutch.

677
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:07,318
- Yes, please.
- I'll take two.

678
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,945
Uh, what about you, Wolf? Mint?

679
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,238
I'm good. Thanks.

680
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,990
So, how'd you guys meet anyway?

681
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,242
Spill it. Spill it.

682
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,661
- Okay, well, uh...
- Well...

683
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,330
You tell it. -No, no, no,
you tell it better.

684
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:20,831
Yeah, but you do all the voices.

685
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:21,998
And, like, you're so good at it.

686
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:23,500
Can somebody tell it?!

687
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,002
Okay, okay.

688
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,213

00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:11,340
Don't mind him, Sugar Beak.
He's a little touchy.

709
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:14,218
Uh, he's been friend-zoned
by the governor.

710
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:17,012
I have not been
friend-zoned by the...

711
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,099
I need a phone.

712
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,601
Madam Governor. Madam Governor.

713
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,853
How soon are the Bad Guys
going back to prison?

714
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,730
Please, let's not jump
to conclusions

715
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,899
before we have all the facts.

716
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,067
Thank you. That's all quest--

717
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,485
That's all the questions
for now.

718
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:32,820
All right, Diane.

719
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:34,405
It's time to implement
damage control.

720
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:35,906
I'm gonna tell the press
there's no more questions

721
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,283
- for now, and if they have...
- Hang on, Maureen.

722
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:38,909
Aunt Linda!

723
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,996
What a pleasant surprise.

724
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:43,580
Wolf, what were you thinking?

725
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,541
WOLF
Diane, listen.

726
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:47,042
We hit a little bit of trouble.

727
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,335
Oh. Which part?

728
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,087
Assaulting
the police commissioner

729
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:53,674
or stealing a priceless belt
in front of thousands of people?

730
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:55,259
It's-it's not
what it looks like.

731
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,386
Someone's setting us up.
You got to believe me.

732
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:59,221
Of course I believe you.

733
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,807
Well, you might be
the only one.

734
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:04,268
Listen, we could really use
your help right now.

735
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:06,437
Wolf, I can't
call off the cops.

736
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:07,938
There's too much heat on you.

737
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,398
I know. I know. I know. I know.

738
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:10,733
If you could just give me
something to work with,

739
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:13,319
a-a clue, a starting place, something.

740
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,279
All I know is,
it-it's got something to do

741
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,072
with that MacGuffinite thing.

742
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,783
- MacGuffinite? Really?
- Yeah.

743
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,618
It's what the Bandit's
been after the whole time.

744
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:24,330
I hate to drag you into this,
but it's our only lead.

745
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:25,789
Can you look into it?

746
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,461
Yeah, I know exactly who to ask.

747
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:32,087
- You do?
- Listen to me.

748
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:34,548
I need you to lay low until
I get to the bottom of this.

749
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:38,510
In the meantime,
don't trust anyone.

750
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:41,180
- And, Wolf...
- Yeah?

751
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:43,307
We'll get through this, okay?

752
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:45,934
I hope so.

753
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,438
Hey. I owe you one.

754
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,982
What are medium friends
for, huh?

755
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,320
Yeah.

756
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:00,866
Maureen?

757
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,910
- Yes, ma'am?
- Cancel my appointments.

758
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:04,411
You got it, ma'am.

759
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:11,378
I've got to catch up
with an old friend.

760
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:22,930
Good news, gang.

761
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:24,640
Diane's gonna help us
clear our names.

762
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:26,684
All we got to do is
lay low and...

763
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:34,733
You.

764
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:38,237
You should've taken
the mint, Whiskers.

765
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:41,366
Hey! Hey.

766
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:43,617
Hiya, boss.

767
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,202
Yeah, the chickens
are in the broiler.

768
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:48,705
Repeat, the chickens
are in the broiler.

769
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,429
What? Where... where are we?

770
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,723
What's happening?

771
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:18,026
Once upon a time,
there was a big, bad wolf.

772
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:20,946
Ooh, love that guy.

773
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:23,115
What a character.

774
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:26,410
He's the one
who challenges the status quo,

775
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:28,120
who takes the big chance.

776
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:32,708
Without him, shoot, I don't
even think we have a story.

777
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:35,794
And they call him the villain.

778
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:39,423
Hmm. Kind of backwards,
don't you think?

779
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:40,632
Do I know you?

780
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:43,427
They call me
the Phantom Bandit.

781
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:45,304
Nice ring to it, I guess.

782
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:49,141
But you can call me Kitty Kat.

783
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:51,059
I think you met my girls.

784
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,811
- Hello!
- Holy shrimp.

785
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,188
I'm Pigtail.

786
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:56,607
It was great honor
to kick the butts of my heroes.

787
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:59,443
The butts were even greater
than my dreams.

788
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:01,487
She's a huge fan.

789
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:02,946
Big crime nerd.

790
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,865
Thanks.

791
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:06,451
I think.

792
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,495
Oh, hey, Susan!

793
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:10,954
Actually...

794
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,415
Hey!

795
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:15,584
- It's Doom.
- Uh...

796
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:18,129
Susan is an alias.

797
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,632
- You lied to me.
- That's all right, papito.

798
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:23,342
- Played me.
- Not cool, man.

799
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:25,469
- Betrayed me.
- Hey. Hey, listen.

800
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,304
- It's just business.
- You're...

801
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,722
- Shady.
- You're...

802
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:29,640
Shady.

803
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:31,266
Let it out, buddy.

804
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,227
You're the perfect woman!

805
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:37,439
She out-snaked a snake!

806
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,525
If that's not true love, well...

807
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:42,444
well, then I don't know
what true love is.

808
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:46,156
Snake...

809
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:50,327
Okay. Kitty, y-you mind telling
us what we're doing here?

810
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,330
Cutting to the chase. I like it.

811
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,666
We're planning something big.

812
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:59,378
Only problem: It's too big
for the three of us.

813
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:01,838
You need work.
We need extra hands.

814
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:06,343
Professionals, you know?
With a specific set of skills.

815
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,972
One last job.

816
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:11,390
Whatcha say?

817
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:12,558
What do we say?

818
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:14,309
No, uh, is the short answer.

819
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,561
But, well, we're flattered.

820
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:16,728
But, uh, the thing is,
you know...

821
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:17,854
- We're good now.
- Yeah.

822
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,648
We don't steal stuff anymore.

823
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:21,358
Yeah, so if you can just,
you know, untie us,

824
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,818
and, uh,
we'll let ourselves out.

825
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:25,404
And we can just call it
a noche, okay?

826
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:42,879
You know what?

827
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,216
I love the red ones.

828
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,552
Is it cherry?

829
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,429
Is it strawberry?
I'm not really sure.

830
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,889
I can never tell.

831
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,809
It's kind of like people,
you know?

832
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,687
You think they're one thing,

833
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:02,984
but it turns out
they're something else entirely.

834
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,237
Diane.

835
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,572
She knows.

836
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:11,992
Can you imagine if this got out?

837
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:15,162
The governor's secret past
as the Crimson Paw?

838
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:17,581
Whew. Talk about a scandal.

839
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:20,793
She will be
in the hot bubble water.

840
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,755
So...

841
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:28,717
Let me rephrase the question.

842
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:33,930
Play along,
and Diane's secret is safe.

843
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:39,603
Or don't, and you, Diane,
the good life,

844
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:44,191
it all comes crashing down.

845
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,902
What'll it be?

846
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:54,202
All right, hot sauce.
What's the job?

847
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:04,628
That's the job.

848
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:06,046
Whoa.

849
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:07,631
Wow.

850
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,592
That's the MoonX rocket.

851
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:17,974
Seriously?

852
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,643
You better believe it, girl.

853
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:22,646
Why steal a car when you can
steal a big, jumbo rocket ship?

854
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:24,189
I think she's serious.

855
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,066
Why would you want
to steal a rocket?

856
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:28,819
A heist is never
just about the loot.

857
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,779
Isn't that right, Wolf?

858
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,073
- It's a power move.
- Exactly.

859
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:34,658
You get it.

860
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,326
He gets it.

861
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,913
All right, now, come on.
We got work to do.

862
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:40,997
And after that,
we're square, right?

863
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,833
You're gonna give us the video?

864
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:44,710
Thieves' honor.

865
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:47,045
This is gonna be gnarly.

866
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,338
In the good way.

867
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,006
Come on, y'all.
We're going on a heist.

868
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:53,802
So, are we bad again, or...?

869
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:55,220
You got to hand it to them.

870
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:57,389
They thought of
almost everything.

871
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:00,809
Almost? Oh, you got an angle.

872
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:03,353
I've always got an angle.

873
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,355
One last job, and after that,

874
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:08,860
Little Miss Lollipop's
gonna regret she ever met us.

875
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,535
Madam Governor?

876
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,204
Take me to his cell.

877
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:32,424
Well, well, well.

878
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:34,134
Hello, Diane.

879
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:35,886
Marmalade.

880
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:41,266
Of all the super maximum prisons
in all the world,

881
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,393
you had to walk into mine.

882
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,936
Oh, my.

883
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,480
You look like a balloon animal.

884
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:48,523
I know, right?

885
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:49,816
Today was arm day.

886
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:52,153
That's why I'm looking
extra swole.

887
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:56,406
So, to what do I owe the visit?

888
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,366
I wonder if it has
anything to do with

889
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:01,411
your mangy protégés fleeing
the scene of a crime.

890
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,455
How do you know about that?

891
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:05,123
It's my job to know.

892
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:07,626
I'm the editor in chief
of the Crazy Max Chronicle.

893
00:43:07,627 --> 00:43:10,253
I also do yearbook, and I'm
captain of the pickleball team.

894
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,130
To be honest, I'm kind of
crushing it in here.

895
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,715
All right, well, good for you.

896
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:16,593
But what do you know
about MacGuffinite?

897
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,428
Oh.

898
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,264
MacGuffinium Fictitium.

899
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,100
Fascinating metal.

900
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:27,104
With one extremely
unique property.

901
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,732
And that is?

902
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,442
Well, I'm not
just gonna tell you, am I?

903
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,735
Did you forget?

904
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:35,862
I'm sitting in prison
for your crimes.

905
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:38,156
So what's in it for me?

906
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:40,784
I am not giving you a pardon.

907
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:42,327
A pardon?

908
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,329
In the middle
of pickleball season?

909
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:47,041
No. I have a better idea.

910
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:51,419
How would you like
to play a game?

911
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,965
What sort of sick game
do you want me to...

912
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,217
Backstabbing governors first.

913
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:01,222
Oh, goody.

914
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,725
All right, everyone, listen up.

915
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:09,646
Each of you has
a specific part to play.

916
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,443
Safecracking gear!

917
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:17,070
Disguises!

918
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,488
Welcome, Ms. Tarantula.

919
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,657
Whoa, that is some serious tech.

920
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,158
Uh, I think
I got the wrong bag.

921
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:24,077
Yeah, this doesn't seem like
proper attire

922
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,954
to infiltrate a launch site.

923
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:27,247
Oh, no.

924
00:44:27,248 --> 00:44:28,998
We're not going
to the launch site.

925
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:31,334
We found a way to circumvent
every level of security

926
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:32,502
leading to the rocket,

927
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,754
and it's right there
on Mr. Moon's wrist.

928
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:36,464
Watch controls everything,

929
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:40,010
from front gate
to mission control

930
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:42,430
to blastoff.

931
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:46,975
Steal the watch,
steal the rocket.

932
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:49,185
Only problem?
He never takes it off.

933
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,438
Lucky we have
world-famous pickpocket.

934
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:53,398
And we think
there's a window.

935
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:55,984
"Jeremiah Moon invites you
to his exclusive,

936
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:57,360
state-of-the-art wedding."

937
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,362
Are you serious?
We're gonna crash the wedding?

938
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,781
Oh, I love weddings!

939
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:04,117
I mean, you know--
I li--

940
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:06,870
I mean, I like them.
They're fine. I don't care.

941
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:08,663
Whatever. No one cares.

942
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:11,583
Um... here's how it's gonna go.

943
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:15,879
This is a highly
exclusive event,

944
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,006
and it's got protection
to match.

945
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:20,467
So, we'll have to get creative.

946
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:23,094
I'm a little rusty,
but I promise

947
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:25,013
to play you respectfully.

948
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:26,556
Mamma mia!

949
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,849
Where's-a my flowers?

950
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:30,602
Prego! Cappuccino! Extra grande!

951
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:32,729
Tutti frutti! Limoncello!

952
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,773
Oh, the veil? It's vintage.

953
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:37,067
A princess wore it.

954
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:38,860
Yoo-hoo!

955
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,779
Jeremiah! Oh, there you are.

956
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,238
Moon wears a pair of

957
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,323
AR-enhancement glasses
that identify

958
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:44,824
the people worth talking to.

959
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,910
And the people who aren't.

960
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:48,995
But-but I'm his aunt!

961
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,622
Those who make the grade earn

962
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:53,083
a 60-second one-on-one
with Mr. Moon. -Jeremiah.

963
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:54,542
That's our window.

964
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:55,919
Our only window.

965
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,963
Once the ceremony begins,

966
00:45:57,964 --> 00:46:00,174
it's over.

967
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:03,426
All right, everyone. I got eyes.

968
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:04,260
Piranha, you're a go.

969
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:06,388
- Hey, Clarence.
- Huh?

970
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:08,223
Something doesn't look right
in this trunk.

971
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:11,101
Oh? What is it?
L-L-Let's see here.

972
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:12,686
Oh, it's there.
It's there. Way in the back.

973
00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:14,854
Uh, I don't see
anything. -Yeah. No, no, no.

974
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:16,648
I think if you put
your head in there.

975
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,944
Oh, Clarence.

976
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,780
All clear here.

977
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:26,366
Titanium triple spring release.

978
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:28,618
I've missed you, my old friend.

979
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:33,665
You're sure you still got this,
Snakey Cakes?

980
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:34,791
SNAKE
Please.

981
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:37,752
Lock picking is like a romance.

982
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:40,130
You got to start
gentle, playful,

983
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:43,216
work your way into
its little cold heart,

984
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:47,804
until all those defenses
melt away.

985
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,055
Oh. Sounds kind of fun.

986
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:54,311
Are we still talking
about the lock?

987
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,815
Huh?

988
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,150
A power outage?

989
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:02,777
Hello.
Extremely quick electrician.

990
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:04,988
Did someone call
for an electrician?

991
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:05,989
Yes, sir. That was me.

992
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:07,657
- She's all clear.
- Oops.

993
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,493
Don't worry. I fix and be out
of your lip hair in no time.

994
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,871
KITTY
All right, girls. Have fun.

995
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,584
Name's Webs.
I'll be your hacker today.

996
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:21,921
Mr. Wolf, that's your cue.

997
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,014
Don't spend
it all in one place, you hear?

998
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:32,933
That's my job.

999
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:37,729
Hey. Afternoon. Howdy, ma'am.

1000
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:38,813
Eyes up, cowboy.

1001
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:41,066
Your target's at twelve o'clock.

1002
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:42,526
WOLF
That's our man.

1003
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:48,907
What are you doing? Get in line.

1004
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:50,492
Buck Wolford doesn't do lines.

1005
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:52,368
Webs, how's my cover ID?

1006
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,703
Hang tight, Wolfie. Just a
couple more firewalls. -Great.

1007
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,205
Relax, Kitty, I got this.

1008
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:56,414
- Wolf?
- Hey, excuse me.

1009
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,208
- Mr. Moon, sir.
- Hey.

1010
00:47:58,209 --> 00:47:59,375
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1011
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:01,462
- Wolf!
- Bypass and boom!

1012
00:48:04,173 --> 00:48:05,673
Careful, careful.

1013
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:08,051
Let's show our wealthy
and influential friend

1014
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:09,677
- a little respect.
- I thank you kindly.

1015
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:11,888
You still got it.

1016
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,725
Now this is it.

1017
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,185
Swap the watch for the dummy.

1018
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:19,354
Well, at least somebody's
civilized around here.

1019
00:48:19,355 --> 00:48:21,397
My name's Buck Wolford.
Big Bad Oil.

1020
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:24,192
But I'm sure you heard of me.
I am just so...

1021
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:25,485
Need a hand?

1022
00:48:25,486 --> 00:48:27,403
Last I checked,
you didn't have any.

1023
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:29,280
You never minded before.

1024
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:30,949
Ow!

1025
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,325
- Is she okay?
- Whoops.

1026
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:33,493
Oh, boy.

1027
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:35,578
Unless I'm mistaken,
rockets do need oil.

1028
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:36,538
How'd you feel about

1029
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:38,456
a strategic partnership,
Mr. Moon?

1030
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:40,583
You're coming to me
with a business proposal

1031
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,253
right before my wedding?

1032
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:45,755
You're a real operator,
Mr. Wolford.

1033
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,093
You don't know the half of it.

1034
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:58,310
Who authorized you
to make eye contact?

1035
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:04,440
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1036
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:05,525
Mr. Wolford?

1037
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:07,110
- Uh...
- Get the watch!

1038
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:08,611
- Moon!
- Ah!

1039
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,947
There's my Soli-wolly.
You're looking extra bald.

1040
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,240
And you're looking short.

1041
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,286
Wolf.

1042
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:18,454
Have we met before?

1043
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:20,665
Uh, no, no. I guess I just have
one of those faces.

1044
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:22,709
Hey, anyway, Mr. Moon, uh...

1045
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:24,335
Did you take
a pottery class in Sydney?

1046
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:25,628
- Uh...
- Sir, it's time.

1047
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,213
Ah, yes. Showtime.

1048
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:28,631
Wait a minute.
Excuse me, Mr.--

1049
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:30,967
Can I just, uh-- Mr. Moon...

1050
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:33,094
No, habibi, listen.
I never forget a face.

1051
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:35,263
I-- Naked high diving!
Was it that?

1052
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:36,764
Oh, hi, yes.

1053
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:39,309
Can I borrow him for
just a moment? -

1054
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,144
- No. Okay.
- Thank you kindly.

1055
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:43,771
You blew the heist!

1056
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:45,481
That guy, I-I-I knew him,

1057
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:47,025
and he was, he was gonna
recognize me.

1058
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:49,444
Bellissima. Bellissima?

1059
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:50,987
Uh, we got a slight problem.

1060
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:55,116
Someone needs to tell Marco
that a shark ate him.

1061
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:57,702
Are you guys trying
to sabotage this?

1062
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:59,538
Who's ready to get married?

1063
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:04,959
- Shark!
- I'm a panicker.

1064
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,169
This is all too much. You happy?

1065
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:07,587
I like this one.

1066
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:10,340
This whole thing's a bust!

1067
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:12,592
You lost your edge.

1068
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:14,177
And now the governor's
gonna pay for it.

1069
00:50:14,178 --> 00:50:15,511
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1070
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:17,013
Hey, let's not do
anything crazy, okay?

1071
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,056
We'll get you the watch.

1072
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:19,766
Oh, yeah?

1073
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:21,185
How?

1074
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:35,032
It's like a freakin' fairy tale.

1075
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:46,377
Honey, you look so beautiful
in this dress.

1076
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:53,384
Hmm.

1077
00:50:56,262 --> 00:50:57,637
"Big Bad Wolf"?

1078
00:50:57,638 --> 00:51:01,057
Hmm. Hmm.

1079
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:03,560
Shark, you're up.

1080
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:14,445
Welcome!

1081
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:19,075
Welcome to this most
beautifious, majestacular,

1082
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:20,910
incredimonious occasion.

1083
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:25,415
Whoo! Whoo!

1084
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:27,834
Could he be a little more
subtle? -(over comm): Whoo!

1085
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:29,794
- For Shark, this is subtle.
- Whoo!

1086
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:31,170
Give it to me real good.

1087
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,965
We stand here today
to marry this man--

1088
00:51:33,966 --> 00:51:36,092
this manly, masculine,

1089
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:39,095
manleously maleful man--

1090
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:41,431
and this totally normal woman

1091
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:44,434
- in the sacra-nimonius bonds...
- What? Wait a minute.

1092
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:46,185
...of holy matriminimamony.

1093
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:47,186
Whoo!

1094
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:50,773
Now, would you please
join hands.

1095
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,860
Hmm. Uh...

1096
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:58,906
That's him!

1097
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:01,743
Yep. Just-just join those hands.

1098
00:52:01,744 --> 00:52:03,953
- Look. Look.
- No need to look at them.

1099
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,455
- Come on. Come on. Come on.
- Just blindly join

1100
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:08,207
- those hands together.
- I object!

1101
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:09,542
- What?!

1102
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:10,878
Honey-bunny.

1103
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,547
Soliman, who do you think
you are?

1104
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:16,799
Moon, look what
you are marrying!

1105
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,635
It's none other than
the Big Bad Wolf!

1106
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:24,349
Here comes the bride.

1107
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:26,642
- Boop.
- How could this be?

1108
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,227
- He was here!
- Soli-wolly, this is a disgrace.

1109
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:29,812
- There were claws! I saw claws!
- Get him out of here now!

1110
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,564
Where are you taking me?!
There are witnesses!

1111
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,066
- We all saw it! You!
- Huh?

1112
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:35,068
- Don't just stand there!
- Hey, where's the officiant?

1113
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:37,278
Ooh, who cares?

1114
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:48,664
Definitely top five
Bad Guys heist ever!

1115
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:52,502
When big man say, "I object,"

1116
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:54,629
I almost make pee-pee accident!

1117
00:52:56,382 --> 00:52:57,840
Right.

1118
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,175
Almost.

1119
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:01,677
Wolf, I-I got to ask.

1120
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:03,554
How'd you know
that was gonna work?

1121
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:07,141
You see, Kitty, there's
three parts to every con.

1122
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:12,856
First, bait the hook.

1123
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,281
Look.

1124
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:23,491
Then comes the turn.

1125
00:53:23,492 --> 00:53:24,951
Something weird is going on.

1126
00:53:24,952 --> 00:53:27,370
- Someone should object.
- I object!

1127
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:29,038
But none of it works
without the payoff. -What?!

1128
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,082
'Cause it's one thing

1129
00:53:31,083 --> 00:53:32,583
to steal the watch...

1130
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,293
Soliman, who do you
think you are? -

1131
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:36,380
Hold on tight, bellissima.

1132
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:41,008
...and another
to get away with it.

1133
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:44,220
The Big Bad Wolf!

1134
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,848
The art of misdirection.

1135
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:49,809
It's not the action,
it's the distraction. Got it.

1136
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:51,394
Yes, ma'am.

1137
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:52,687
Hey!

1138
00:53:52,688 --> 00:53:55,231
All right, I see you.

1139
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,650
Oh, I love weddings!

1140
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:58,902
All right!

1141
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:07,076
Hmm.

1142
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:10,037
No. Not there.

1143
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:12,874
No. Maybe...

1144
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:14,584
- Oh, so many options.
- Oh, my goodness.

1145
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:17,378
Can we move this along?

1146
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:18,588
Patience, Diane.

1147
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:19,964
This is a game
of subtle strategy

1148
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:22,216
and psychological endurance
mastered only by

1149
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:24,927
the most cunning
and sophisticated minds.

1150
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:27,847
"Ages six and up."

1151
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:30,933
Besides, it's not
every day that the governor

1152
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:33,812
drops by to chat about
quantum ferromagnetism.

1153
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:39,902
Quantu-- Wait, are you saying
MacGuffinite is magnetic?

1154
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:42,612
Not just a magnet.

1155
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:45,531
MacGuffinite is
the atomic inverse of gold.

1156
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:47,783
Exposed to extreme voltage...

1157
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,702
It will cause gold electrons
to decouple

1158
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,621
and attract
with spectacular force.

1159
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:53,289
It's a gold magnet.

1160
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,291
Oh, she's catching on.

1161
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:57,793
Very good.

1162
00:54:57,794 --> 00:55:01,964
Why rob a bank when you can
make the gold come to you?

1163
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:05,594
All the crime,
none of the exercise.

1164
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:08,513
- Uh, thanks, Professor.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1165
00:55:08,514 --> 00:55:11,474
You can't go.
We haven't finished our...

1166
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:14,060
What? No! But how?!

1167
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:16,062
It's literally tic-tac-toe.

1168
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:17,981
Send me your yearbook?

1169
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:20,858
You know, it's funny.

1170
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:23,694
You're the second person
to come all the way here

1171
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:25,572
to ask me about MacGuffinite.

1172
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:29,992
What are the odds?

1173
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,703
You had a visitor?

1174
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:34,121
I didn't get her name,

1175
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:37,124
but apparently we have
a friend in common.

1176
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:40,254
Or should I say... five?

1177
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:50,054
Madam Governor.

1178
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:54,058
I need footage of Marmalade's
last visitor. Now.

1179
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,370
Found ya.

1180
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:28,426
- But can I drive?
- No. -

1181
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:30,928
This was
new best day of my life.

1182
00:56:31,972 --> 00:56:34,223
- Why must you leave forever?
- Aw.

1183
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:37,393
- Cheer up, Buttersnout.
- Buttersnout?

1184
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,270
- I always wanted a nickname.
- Oh.

1185
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:40,646
Uh, great.

1186
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:44,859
Hey, listen, uh, no hard
feelings about the whole,

1187
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,193
you know, pretend relationship

1188
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:47,903
to entrap you
and your buddies, okay?

1189
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:49,071
Oh.

1190
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,823
Come on, now. Of course not.

1191
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:53,200
I mean, to be honest,
I-I wasn't, uh,

1192
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,577
really that into you.

1193
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:55,953
Oh, weird.

1194
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:59,415
'Cause you, uh,
you seemed pretty into me.

1195
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:00,583
Well, that's...

1196
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:02,251
Yeah?

1197
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:04,295
That-- You know, I didn't
want to hurt your feelings,

1198
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:06,714
so, uh, yeah,
sorry if you're disappointed.

1199
00:57:06,715 --> 00:57:08,758
Oh, no, no, no, no, not me.

1200
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:11,886
You see, uh, I'd only be
disappointed if I was into you,

1201
00:57:11,887 --> 00:57:16,641
which, uh, as previously
established, I was not, okay?

1202
00:57:16,642 --> 00:57:17,892
Of course.

1203
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:19,935
Otherwise,
this marshmallow toast

1204
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:22,521
would be
full of romantic tension.

1205
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:24,107
Hmm.

1206
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,777
Yeah. Of course I did.

1207
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:29,153
WOLF
Oh, really?

1208
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:32,448
So impersonating the bride
was your idea?

1209
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:33,949
- Absolutely.
- Yeah. Okay.

1210
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:35,660
I hired you.

1211
00:57:35,661 --> 00:57:38,245
Therefore, your ideas
are my ideas.

1212
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:39,580
Classy.

1213
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:40,706
What's going on
with the MacGuffinite?

1214
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,792
Oh, just a little
science project.

1215
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:45,628
Ah. So you framed us
for science?

1216
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:48,881
Come on, I had to frame you.

1217
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:51,550
It was the only way
to draw you out of retirement.

1218
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,889
Anyway, you got
what you wanted, so, uh...

1219
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:59,183
Oh. Oh!

1220
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:02,479
Right. You want the video.

1221
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:06,440
There we go.

1222
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:07,942
- Ooh.
- Oh, man.

1223
00:58:07,943 --> 00:58:10,820
Did... did I ever tell you
about my first heist?

1224
00:58:10,821 --> 00:58:12,154
Uh, no.

1225
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,907
Um, was it a bank?
Jewelry store?

1226
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:17,493
Lollipop.

1227
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,495
Back in school, we had a teacher

1228
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:22,748
who used to give
the good kids a lollipop.

1229
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:25,751
And maybe it was
my claws or my teeth,

1230
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:29,046
but she never, ever
looked my way.

1231
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,756
It was hurtful.

1232
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:33,467
So one day, when the old fart
wasn't looking,

1233
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:37,471
I snuck into the drawer
and swiped the whole bag.

1234
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:39,682
After that,

1235
00:58:39,683 --> 00:58:43,853
when the kids wanted lollipops,
they came to me.

1236
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:45,980
Dude, it was amazing, man.

1237
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:50,026
For the first time in my life,
I felt powerful.

1238
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:53,487
I must've pulled off
a hundred jobs since then.

1239
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:58,200
And the more you steal,
the more they respect you.

1240
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:00,411
Hmm.

1241
00:59:00,412 --> 00:59:02,664
Why would you give that up?

1242
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:09,378
You think if you play nice
and follow their rules,

1243
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:13,883
they'll just see you
for who you truly are.

1244
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:17,261
But let me tell you, they won't.

1245
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:20,932
What if the bad life
was your best life?

1246
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:24,226
My advice:

1247
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:28,940
Stop hoping
and enjoy the lollipop.

1248
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:50,419
- Did you get it?
- Oh, we got it.

1249
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:53,005
Come on, I had to frame you.

1250
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:54,757
It was the only way
to draw you out--

1251
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:56,258
Full confession.

1252
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:57,843
I can't believe
she didn't notice the camera.

1253
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:59,303
All we need to do is get this

1254
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:01,096
to the chief and clear
our names. -All right.

1255
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:02,431
- We did it. We did it.
- Whoo! Yeah!

1256
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:05,018
Woo-hoo! -Touchdown dance!

1257
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:09,188
Hey, buddy.

1258
01:00:09,189 --> 01:00:10,689
You okay?

1259
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,608
Huh?

1260
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:14,610
Oh. Uh, nothing.

1261
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,487
Just, uh,
imagining my next round

1262
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:18,823
of thrilling job interviews.

1263
01:00:18,824 --> 01:00:20,783
Wolfie, this is the plan.

1264
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:23,161
Yeah. No, I know.
I'm just saying...

1265
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:25,621
What am I saying?

1266
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:27,790
I'm just saying, wh--
what if we took a wrong turn

1267
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:30,417
with the whole going good thing?

1268
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:31,628
You know what I mean?

1269
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:35,506
Yeah, but it's gonna be
different this time.

1270
01:00:35,507 --> 01:00:37,842
"Captured the Phantom Bandit."

1271
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:39,176
That'll look great
on your résumé.

1272
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:41,805
We're gonna be heroes.
Piranha Street.

1273
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:44,139
Yeah, no, yeah. Totally.

1274
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:47,184
What am I talking about?
You're right.

1275
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:48,978
Come on, let's find the chief.

1276
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:50,646
- Let's go.
- That's my Wolf.

1277
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,485
Uh-oh.

1278
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:59,780
Did you really think
it was gonna be that easy?

1279
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:01,657
Shoot.

1280
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,242
Hey! -Watch it!

1281
01:01:03,243 --> 01:01:05,411
Naughty, naughty.

1282
01:01:05,412 --> 01:01:06,996
Are these gold?

1283
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:10,332
Kitty, can we talk about this
for a second? Uh...

1284
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:11,877
Nope.

1285
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:16,714
Is that MacGuffinite?

1286
01:01:16,715 --> 01:01:17,840
What's going on?

1287
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:20,634
How about I show you?

1288
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:26,182
Ooh, shiny.

1289
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:29,311
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1290
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:36,859
A gold magnet?

1291
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:39,028
You bet your scaly butt it is.

1292
01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:41,196
And this is just a prototype.

1293
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:43,782
Wait till you see
what it can do in zero gravity.

1294
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:46,076
- You're taking it to space?
- Obviously.

1295
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:47,786
What do you think
giant rocket is for?

1296
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:49,705
Is not for science fair.

1297
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:51,373
You can't expect us to steal

1298
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:53,208
all the world's gold
from down here.

1299
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:56,462
The biggest heist in history.

1300
01:01:56,463 --> 01:01:57,963
Courtesy of us.

1301
01:01:57,964 --> 01:01:59,381
All the world's gold?

1302
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:02,384
Oh. Oh.
And the cherry on top!

1303
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:03,928
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. What are you doing?

1304
01:02:03,929 --> 01:02:06,055
The video?
You don't need to ruin Diane.

1305
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:07,431
Let's-- Let's-- Come on.

1306
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:09,016
- Let's talk about this.
- Hmm, see, thing is,

1307
01:02:09,017 --> 01:02:11,894
I promised this rodent
that I would.

1308
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:14,271
Kind of a quid pro quo
type thing.

1309
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:16,607
- Marmalade.
- I know.

1310
01:02:16,608 --> 01:02:18,317
What a goofball.

1311
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:21,570
But a real wiz
with the science stuff.

1312
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:23,072
I-I'll tell you what.

1313
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:26,951
'Cause we're friends,
I'm gonna give you a choice.

1314
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:32,748
No, no, no, no, no! Stop it.

1315
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:35,418
You can stop it with this.

1316
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:39,839
What the...

1317
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:45,427
The upload is paired
to the magnet.

1318
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:49,264
The moment you turn it off,
the video goes viral.

1319
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:52,559
Or leave it on, protect Diane,

1320
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:56,063
but y'all keep dangling
until the police arrive.

1321
01:02:56,064 --> 01:02:58,816
Oh, such a dilemma.

1322
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:02,111
The police?

1323
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:03,529
LUGGINS
Hello. Commissioner speaking.

1324
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:05,906
Yes, ma'am. I got a hot tip.

1325
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:08,075
The Bad Guys are holed up
in a hangar

1326
01:03:08,076 --> 01:03:09,451
two klicks north
of the MoonX launch site.

1327
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:11,704
What? W-Wait. Wh-Who is...

1328
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:13,288
Sorry, doll.

1329
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:14,999
Look, it's nothing personal.

1330
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:17,918
You are so hot right now.

1331
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:19,670
- Snake!
- Yeah?

1332
01:03:19,671 --> 01:03:20,713
Come on, man.

1333
01:03:20,714 --> 01:03:23,132
You are one twisted reptile.

1334
01:03:23,133 --> 01:03:26,176
I wish I could stick around
to see how it ends,

1335
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:28,762
but we've got a rocket to steal.

1336
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:30,222
Ciao.

1337
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:33,017
Kitty. Kitty, wait.
Hold on a second, please.

1338
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,483
See? This is why
I'm not a cat person.

1339
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:43,861
How are we supposed to choose?

1340
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:45,738
We're not.
I don't give up that easy.

1341
01:03:45,739 --> 01:03:47,239
- Piranha.
- Yeah?

1342
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,824
I need you to pull out the USB.
Follow my lead.

1343
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:50,367

01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:10,525
I know everything.
The MacGuffinite. The magnet.

1407
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:13,028
Hmm.
You talked to Marmalade.

1408
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:15,864
Actually, he did
most of the talking.

1409
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:18,368
I'm more of an action girl.

1410
01:07:20,203 --> 01:07:22,704
Step aside before anger
becomes punch.

1411
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:55,737
You're all under arrest.

1412
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:57,197
Governor's orders.

1413
01:07:57,198 --> 01:08:00,076
Ooh, feisty.

1414
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:03,120
You don't know, do you?

1415
01:08:03,121 --> 01:08:04,746
You're not governor anymore.

1416
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:06,707
You might want to check
your phone.

1417
01:08:06,708 --> 01:08:08,208
Crimson Paw.

1418
01:08:08,209 --> 01:08:11,129
Crimson... What?

1419
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:16,384
No. No, no, no, no, no. But...

1420
01:08:20,263 --> 01:08:22,431
How-- H-How?

1421
01:08:30,565 --> 01:08:33,066
They never expect the dart.

1422
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:35,068
Shall we?

1423
01:08:37,196 --> 01:08:38,698
Kitty!

1424
01:08:39,657 --> 01:08:41,408
Kitty.

1425
01:08:56,424 --> 01:08:59,217
A viral video has revealed
that the notorious thief

1426
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:01,219
known as the Crimson Paw was

1427
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:04,473
none other than Governor
Diane Foxington! -

1428
01:09:04,474 --> 01:09:06,892
While police search
for the rogue politician,

1429
01:09:06,893 --> 01:09:09,603
they have wasted no time
in ordering the speedy release

1430
01:09:09,604 --> 01:09:12,397
of sweet, adorable
Professor Marmalade,

1431
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:16,985
unlike the Bad Guys,
whose claim to have "changed"

1432
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:19,488
fooled absolutely no one.

1433
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:21,948
Chief, we were set up
by a gang of supercriminals.

1434
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:23,658
They turned the MacGuffinite
into a gold magnet.

1435
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:25,202
- Back in line.
- And they're stealing

1436
01:09:25,203 --> 01:09:27,245
that rocket to take it to space.

1437
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:29,122
Yeah, that's what they all say.

1438
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:32,501
Ch-Chief, I know it looks bad,
but if we did this,

1439
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:35,003
why would we help you
solve the case?

1440
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:36,922
Why would we tell you
about the MacGuffinite?

1441
01:09:36,923 --> 01:09:39,674
And where's the loot?
You know it doesn't add up.

1442
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:41,676
Look, we don't have proof,

1443
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:45,680
but I know, somewhere in that
big, booming heart of yours,

1444
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:48,809
you know we didn't do this.

1445
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:50,686
Chief, please.

1446
01:09:53,523 --> 01:09:56,400
How many times
do I have to tell you, Wolf?

1447
01:09:56,401 --> 01:09:58,653
It's "Commissioner."

1448
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:10,372
Ready to fly this thing?

1449
01:10:10,373 --> 01:10:13,334
With watch, rocket flies itself.

1450
01:10:19,507 --> 01:10:21,675
Hey, Jenny. You seeing this?

1451
01:10:21,676 --> 01:10:22,801
Uh...

1452
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:53,249
So much for Piranha Street.

1453
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:09,514
Ow.

1454
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:13,059
Chief?

1455
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:15,187
Okay, let's say,
hypothetically, I believe you--

1456
01:11:15,188 --> 01:11:16,688
Which I don't.

1457
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:20,025
But if I did... if I did
and some supercriminal

1458
01:11:20,026 --> 01:11:23,278
has a gold magnet,
how would we stop them?

1459
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:25,822
You... you believe us?

1460
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:33,663
No! No, no, no!

1461
01:11:33,664 --> 01:11:34,998
No! No!

1462
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:36,541
I want to give her a hug.

1463
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:37,959
Ooh, I like Chief.

1464
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,212
Ooh, wow, Chief,
is that a new shampoo?

1465
01:11:40,213 --> 01:11:41,630
Okay, okay.

1466
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:43,298
Please stop with the touching.

1467
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:44,841
I don't get you guys.

1468
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:46,551
You're good, then you're bad,
then you're sort of good,

1469
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:48,136
then really bad.

1470
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:49,721
Ugh, it's hard to keep up!

1471
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:52,307
Yep, yep. That's fair.

1472
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:54,184
I get it.
We're all over the place.

1473
01:11:54,185 --> 01:11:57,020
But you need to get us to that
rocket before it takes off.

1474
01:11:57,021 --> 01:12:00,190
Rocket? What-what are you
talking about?

1475
01:12:00,191 --> 01:12:03,652
Initiating backwards counting.

1476
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:05,195
Countdown initiated.

1477
01:12:05,196 --> 01:12:08,448
Countdown initiated?
Whoa. What's going on?

1478
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:10,492
- I don't know.
- Well, shut it down, Jenny!

1479
01:12:10,493 --> 01:12:12,577
- Shut it down!
- I'm trying, Jim!

1480
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:13,828
Uh, Mr. Moon?

1481
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:15,539
Uh, we've got
a slight situation.

1482
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:17,082
The launch isn't
until next wee--

1483
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:23,923
Well, butter my crumpets.

1484
01:12:32,515 --> 01:12:33,848
Five, four...

1485
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:35,475
Evacuate!

1486
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:38,813
...three, two, one.

1487
01:12:51,701 --> 01:12:53,703
Woo-hoo!

1488
01:12:55,955 --> 01:12:58,248
The twists just keep coming.

1489
01:12:58,249 --> 01:13:02,002
The MoonX rocket seems to have
taken off three days early--

1490
01:13:02,003 --> 01:13:03,420
Huh?

1491
01:13:03,421 --> 01:13:05,547
What the hairbrush?

1492
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:10,386
Yeah!

1493
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:13,346
Uh-oh.

1494
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:14,598
Bring it on!

1495
01:13:14,599 --> 01:13:17,225
Whoa!

1496
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:34,076
Holy moly.

1497
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:39,205
Are you sure about this?!

1498
01:13:39,206 --> 01:13:41,416
Not particularly. No.

1499
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:45,421
Remember, when you come back,
you're under arrest!

1500
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:49,091
You got it... Commissioner.

1501
01:13:50,593 --> 01:13:52,511
Go get 'em, guys.

1502
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:56,890
All right, here we go.

1503
01:13:56,891 --> 01:13:58,768
First time
for everything, right?

1504
01:14:20,498 --> 01:14:22,457
- Run, run, run! Let's go!
- Come on!

1505
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:24,794
Go! Go! Go!

1506
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:31,716
- Let's go, go, go, go, go!
- Guys, come on!

1507
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:32,968
Move, move, move!

1508
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:37,972
We did it. We did it.
We did it. -PIRANHA: Yeah!

1509
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:39,600
- Woo-hoo!
- We did it!

1510
01:14:40,601 --> 01:14:42,310
We didn't do it.

1511
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:44,021
Jump!

1512
01:14:56,617 --> 01:14:57,992
Pull us up, Snake!

1513
01:14:57,993 --> 01:15:01,747
Vinyasa, baby!

1514
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:06,502
Up there! The cargo bay!

1515
01:15:20,641 --> 01:15:22,642
Pull!

1516
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:25,145
Come on! Pull! Pull!

1517
01:15:25,146 --> 01:15:26,688
Are you kidding me?!

1518
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:28,858
Lefty-loosey, righty-tighty.

1519
01:15:30,067 --> 01:15:32,652
Oh, right.

1520
01:15:32,653 --> 01:15:34,864
What is it?

1521
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:41,871
Ah, never mind. Just glitch.

1522
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:46,374
Whoa.

1523
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:51,046
Now, that is a view.

1524
01:15:57,636 --> 01:15:59,387
What is happening?!

1525
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:02,432
Sir, they're heading to the
Multinational Space Station.

1526
01:16:02,433 --> 01:16:03,893
I think they're docking.

1527
01:16:20,201 --> 01:16:22,870
Doom, you're with me.

1528
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:26,748
Pigtail, get the MacGuffinite
in place.

1529
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:29,793
You got it, Kitty.

1530
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:36,633
Yoo-hoo. Anybody home?

1531
01:16:44,475 --> 01:16:46,434
Ooh, nice decor.

1532
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:48,353
Very, uh, space-y.

1533
01:16:52,942 --> 01:16:55,985
In hindsight,
that was a little reckless.

1534
01:16:55,986 --> 01:16:57,695
Did everybody make it?

1535
01:16:57,696 --> 01:16:59,572
Hey, wh-where's Piranha?

1536
01:16:59,573 --> 01:17:01,282
Whee!

1537
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:03,868
I can fly!

1538
01:17:03,869 --> 01:17:06,663
I just needed to believe
in myself. Ha!

1539
01:17:06,664 --> 01:17:10,333
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.

1540
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:12,627
Oh, you...
you guys can fly, too?

1541
01:17:15,673 --> 01:17:17,465
All right, watch the legs.

1542
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:19,969
Whoa. Guys, check this out.

1543
01:17:20,845 --> 01:17:22,428
What is she doing?

1544
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:36,150
They're using
the MoonX Power Cell

1545
01:17:36,151 --> 01:17:38,654
to activate the MacGuffinite.

1546
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:40,990
Kind of genius.

1547
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:48,288
Yeah, they're smart,

1548
01:17:48,289 --> 01:17:50,332
but there's something
they didn't count on.

1549
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:53,878
I got a plan.

1550
01:17:56,005 --> 01:17:59,007
Mm-hmm. Installation complete.

1551
01:17:59,008 --> 01:18:01,677
Confirming coordinates.

1552
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:21,738
Shouldn't we, uh, get
some special training for this?

1553
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:23,449
Just don't-don't look down.

1554
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:29,370
Uh, follow-up question:
Which way is down?

1555
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:30,538
Listen up.

1556
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:32,123
This is all about timing.

1557
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:34,459
Webs, Shark, I need you
to hack the external console

1558
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:37,879
while Snake and Piranha pop
the control panel to engage

1559
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:39,505
- the manual override switch.
- You got it.

1560
01:18:39,506 --> 01:18:42,717
- And what about Kitty?
- Leave her to me.

1561
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:44,385
We got one shot
to save the world.

1562
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:46,305
Let's make it count.

1563
01:18:48,015 --> 01:18:49,432
Okay, buddy. You can do this.

1564
01:18:49,433 --> 01:18:51,726
- First, clear the root folder.
- Mm-hmm.

1565
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:53,436
Then in system directory, type

1566
01:18:53,437 --> 01:18:55,772
"ENC underscore word equals
word dot encode." -Mm-hmm.

1567
01:18:55,773 --> 01:18:57,440
Now "import hashlib."

1568
01:18:57,441 --> 01:18:58,858
- Mm-hmm.
- Hit enter.

1569
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:00,610
Then "input underscore path
equals input."

1570
01:19:00,611 --> 01:19:02,862
Okay. Cool, cool. Got it.

1571
01:19:02,863 --> 01:19:07,200
Okay, so, clear
the root folder, you say.

1572
01:19:09,328 --> 01:19:11,454
Okay, come on.
Come on, Piranha.

1573
01:19:11,455 --> 01:19:12,956
You're not nervous, right?

1574
01:19:12,957 --> 01:19:15,333
'Cause we know what happens
when you're nervous.

1575
01:19:15,334 --> 01:19:18,586
Wh-What would I be
nervous about?

1576
01:19:19,713 --> 01:19:21,798
Oh. Piranha!

1577
01:19:21,799 --> 01:19:22,799
- Dude!
- Sorry.

1578
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,426
I can taste it.

1579
01:19:27,554 --> 01:19:30,056
We're in position.

1580
01:19:30,057 --> 01:19:33,268
I think it's time

Oh. Thank you.

1591
01:20:10,556 --> 01:20:12,182
Oh. Thank you.

1592
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:15,518
What's going on?
Why am I flying?

1593
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:34,162
Holy potatoes.

1594
01:20:34,163 --> 01:20:35,788
It's actually working.

1595
01:20:35,789 --> 01:20:37,124
Ooh, yeah!

1596
01:20:39,293 --> 01:20:40,251
Oh, boy.

1597
01:20:40,252 --> 01:20:42,754
- How we doing, Snake?
- Hang on.

1598
01:20:42,755 --> 01:20:43,963
Got it!

1599
01:20:43,964 --> 01:20:46,841
Like stealing candy and a baby.

1600
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:49,218
Don't you mean
"candy from a baby"?

1601
01:20:49,219 --> 01:20:51,012
I know what I said.

1602
01:20:51,013 --> 01:20:52,346
How about the air lock?

1603
01:20:54,808 --> 01:20:57,769
All right, Webs.
I like your style.

1604
01:20:57,770 --> 01:20:59,854
Oh, that one was all Shark.

1605
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:01,189
I panicked.

1606
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:03,191
But it worked out.
I'm a programmer now.

1607
01:21:03,192 --> 01:21:05,360
I'm going in.

1608
01:21:09,156 --> 01:21:10,866
- What was that?
- Huh?

1609
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:15,412
Oh, that's not good.

1610
01:21:21,794 --> 01:21:23,878
Uh...

1611
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:25,630
Snake, buddy, I'm sorry.

1612
01:21:25,631 --> 01:21:26,923
What? No, no, no...

1613
01:21:29,635 --> 01:21:31,178
I hate you.

1614
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:36,891
Get to the air lock!

1615
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:38,519
Go, go, go!

1616
01:21:43,482 --> 01:21:46,527
Girls, nothing gonna
stop us now.

1617
01:21:52,866 --> 01:21:54,575
Snakey Cakes?

1618
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:57,703
Help... me.

1619
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:02,083
Stop farting, you maniac!

1620
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:03,584
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on.

1621
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:06,212
Turn it off, all right?
You're gonna kill them.

1622
01:22:06,213 --> 01:22:08,506
I'm sorry.
Whose side are you on?

1623
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:11,759
Kitty, stop! It's just a heist.

1624
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,845
It's never just a heist!

1625
01:22:15,305 --> 01:22:18,100
Secure the air lock. Now.

1626
01:22:18,892 --> 01:22:20,434
Whatever you say, boss.

1627
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,361
"Turn it off."

1628
01:22:30,362 --> 01:22:33,365
Ha! I'm just getting started.

1629
01:22:53,093 --> 01:22:54,760
It is total mayhem!

1630
01:22:54,761 --> 01:22:57,763
A cataclysmic gold storm is
literally destroying the city!

1631
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:06,480
Oh, yeah.

1632
01:23:06,481 --> 01:23:07,815
The gold.

1633
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:09,192
Come to mama.

1634
01:23:09,193 --> 01:23:11,068
You know,
I've been thinking. -

1635
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:12,361
Wolf?

1636
01:23:12,362 --> 01:23:14,405
Doesn't that word sound
kind of made-up?

1637
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:15,990
"Gold."
It's kind of weird, right?

1638
01:23:15,991 --> 01:23:17,992
- It's weird.
It's weird-- It's a weird word.

1639
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:20,828
Go ahead. S-Say, say, "Gold."

1640
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:24,123
Gold. Gold. Gold.

1641
01:23:24,124 --> 01:23:25,499
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

1642
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:28,336
I'm gonna need you
to turn off the magnet.

1643
01:23:28,337 --> 01:23:30,254
Or I'll just do it for you.

1644
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:32,758
Is that supposed to be funny?

1645
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:43,226
Stay with me, papo.

1646
01:23:43,227 --> 01:23:44,518
Stay with me!

1647
01:23:44,519 --> 01:23:47,021
I-I don't want
to die like this.

1648
01:23:48,232 --> 01:23:50,483
Oof.

1649
01:23:56,990 --> 01:23:58,532
Okay, okay.

1650
01:23:58,533 --> 01:24:00,368
Come on, Piranha, your friend
is spinning out in space.

1651
01:24:00,369 --> 01:24:02,621
You should know what to do.

1652
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:05,331
That's it! The pen!

1653
01:24:05,332 --> 01:24:06,791
The pen? Wha...

1654
01:24:06,792 --> 01:24:09,126
Grab the pen! The pen!
Grab the... -

1655
01:24:09,127 --> 01:24:10,878
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

1656
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:13,965
Okay, I can do stuff.
I can do stuff.

1657
01:24:24,726 --> 01:24:27,812
Why would you risk your life
to save people who wouldn't even

1658
01:24:27,813 --> 01:24:29,398
give you a chance?

1659
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:36,280
At least when you were the Big
Bad Wolf, they respected you.

1660
01:24:37,239 --> 01:24:39,073
Oh, that was respect, huh?

1661
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:40,741
That wasn't respect.
That was fear.

1662
01:24:40,742 --> 01:24:42,910
Oh, whatever, man.

1663
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:44,161
What's the difference?

1664
01:24:44,162 --> 01:24:46,414
Trust me, there's a difference.

1665
01:24:46,415 --> 01:24:48,332
Respect is earned.

1666
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:50,585
One day, you'll learn that.

1667
01:25:12,816 --> 01:25:16,528
Honestly, Wolf, what made
you think this would work?

1668
01:25:17,946 --> 01:25:19,280
Who says it didn't?

1669
01:25:19,281 --> 01:25:22,533
Like you said,
it's not about the action.

1670
01:25:22,534 --> 01:25:24,494
It's about the distraction.

1671
01:25:27,205 --> 01:25:31,625
Hey, genius, the watch controls
the shuttle, not the magnet.

1672
01:25:31,626 --> 01:25:34,003
You get it.

1673
01:25:34,004 --> 01:25:35,797
She gets it.

1674
01:25:45,015 --> 01:25:47,141
Got it!

1675
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:48,934
You sure about this?

1676
01:25:48,935 --> 01:25:51,103
Trust me, chico.

1677
01:25:51,104 --> 01:25:53,148
Tuna power!

1678
01:26:02,908 --> 01:26:04,534
I got it!

1679
01:26:06,661 --> 01:26:09,914
Well done, boys.
Webs, tell me you're ready.

1680
01:26:09,915 --> 01:26:11,541
Lining it up, Wolfie.

1681
01:26:15,212 --> 01:26:16,796
Nice work, kid.

1682
01:26:16,797 --> 01:26:17,880
No.

1683
01:26:17,881 --> 01:26:20,466
You want to see
a power move, Kitty?

1684
01:26:20,467 --> 01:26:23,177
This is a power move.

1685
01:26:54,876 --> 01:26:57,379
It's fine.

1686
01:26:58,213 --> 01:26:59,713
- -Huh?
- Hello!

1687
01:26:59,714 --> 01:27:03,217
- Need a hand?
- I got you, Snakey Cakes.

1688
01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:05,553
Oh, Sugar Beak.

1689
01:27:05,554 --> 01:27:08,973
And you said
you weren't into me.

1690
01:27:08,974 --> 01:27:13,228
Why would you believe
anything I say?

1691
01:27:13,979 --> 01:27:15,605
No!

1692
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:21,026
How do you expect to get back
to Earth without a shuttle?!

1693
01:27:21,027 --> 01:27:23,320
At least there's an Earth
to go back...

1694
01:27:23,321 --> 01:27:26,365
You destroyed my beautiful plan!

1695
01:27:47,929 --> 01:27:50,598
What did I tell you about
messing with my friends?

1696
01:27:50,599 --> 01:27:52,433
- Wha-- How did you...
- Wolf, we got-- Oh.

1697
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:04,696
We tried to stop her
from posting...

1698
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,872
Ah, wow. What happened
to medium friendly?

1699
01:28:14,873 --> 01:28:18,209
Well, good thing I'm
not the governor anymore, huh?

1700
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:22,796
Ugh, gross.

1701
01:28:22,797 --> 01:28:24,798
- 'Bout time.
- Guys!

1702
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:25,966
Whoa! Diane.

1703
01:28:25,967 --> 01:28:27,468
What are you doing here?

1704
01:28:27,469 --> 01:28:29,178
Just happened to be
orbiting the Earth.

1705
01:28:29,179 --> 01:28:30,346
Thought I'd drop by.

1706
01:28:30,347 --> 01:28:32,056
Woo-hoo! -Yeah!

1707
01:28:32,057 --> 01:28:33,724
We did it, baby.

1708
01:28:33,725 --> 01:28:35,184
I feel the love.
Like, I feel it.

1709
01:28:35,185 --> 01:28:38,812
I hear about the famous
Bad Guys all my life.

1710
01:28:38,813 --> 01:28:40,941
But now I get it.

1711
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:44,986
Alert.

1712
01:28:48,406 --> 01:28:49,991
Alert.

1713
01:28:52,035 --> 01:28:53,328
Alert.

1714
01:28:54,079 --> 01:28:56,330
- It is a massive system failure.
- Alert.

1715
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:58,332
We're falling out of orbit.

1716
01:29:08,843 --> 01:29:10,511
I think this is it, Wolfie.

1717
01:29:10,512 --> 01:29:11,554
We're doomed!

1718
01:29:11,555 --> 01:29:12,846
One last hug, everybody?

1719
01:29:12,847 --> 01:29:14,890
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hang on.

1720
01:29:14,891 --> 01:29:16,642
Don't talk like that.

1721
01:29:16,643 --> 01:29:20,354
Sure, it's-- it looks--
yeah, it's bad.

1722
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:22,147
Yeah, okay. It's bad.

1723
01:29:22,148 --> 01:29:23,983
Sure, we're hurtling
towards Earth in a tin can,

1724
01:29:23,984 --> 01:29:25,609
staring squarely
into the face of death.

1725
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:28,195
Sure, our blood may boil,
our bones may liquefy,

1726
01:29:28,196 --> 01:29:31,031
but if there's one thing
that I know about this crew,

1727
01:29:31,032 --> 01:29:35,160
it's that we never,
ever give up.

1728
01:29:35,161 --> 01:29:38,664
Because we have something
that's stronger than fear,

1729
01:29:38,665 --> 01:29:41,041
stronger than even gravity.

1730
01:29:41,042 --> 01:29:42,376
And that's hope.

1731
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:44,253
Yeah, hope.

1732
01:29:44,254 --> 01:29:45,880
That's hope.

1733
01:29:47,799 --> 01:29:49,634
We're gonna land this thing...

1734
01:29:50,468 --> 01:29:52,052
...or we're gonna die tryi--

1735
01:30:00,353 --> 01:30:02,104
What those guys,

1736
01:30:02,105 --> 01:30:04,982
those brave, beautiful guys
did up there,

1737
01:30:04,983 --> 01:30:09,903
saving the world from
a 24-karat catastrophe.

1738
01:30:09,904 --> 01:30:13,324
And despite all the rejection
and suspicion,

1739
01:30:13,325 --> 01:30:18,120
all the tiny humiliations,
they did it for us.

1740
01:30:18,121 --> 01:30:20,956
They didn't do it
for the fame or for the glory.

1741
01:30:20,957 --> 01:30:23,876
They did it for us.

1742
01:30:23,877 --> 01:30:26,170
They weren't just good guys.

1743
01:30:27,255 --> 01:30:29,632
They were my best friends.

1744
01:30:29,633 --> 01:30:32,635
And I would give anything
to arrest them

1745
01:30:32,636 --> 01:30:34,845
just one more time.

1746
01:30:40,268 --> 01:30:43,063
This one's for you, Wolfie!

1747
01:30:45,982 --> 01:30:50,611
I, for one, am outraged that
it took an evil space magnet

1748
01:30:50,612 --> 01:30:53,072
for people to realize
that the Bad Guys

1749
01:30:53,073 --> 01:30:56,075
were worthy of our love
all along.

1750
01:30:56,076 --> 01:30:59,161
But it's too late,
because now they're dead.

1751
01:31:01,331 --> 01:31:03,123
Ironically, the only survivors

1752
01:31:03,124 --> 01:31:04,958
were the perpetrators
of the heist,

1753
01:31:04,959 --> 01:31:08,253
including the supercriminal
known as the Phantom Bandit,

1754
01:31:08,254 --> 01:31:12,050
while a second escape pod
was, tragically, empty.

1755
01:31:24,354 --> 01:31:26,355
Did I sell it or did I sell it?

1756
01:31:26,356 --> 01:31:29,024

to do some serious good.

01:32:01,349 --> 01:32:03,475
I-I don't understand.
What-What's happening?

1771

1782
01:32:53,985 --> 01:32:56,236
