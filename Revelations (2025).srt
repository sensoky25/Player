00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,641
MISSION NATION CHURCH

4
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:57,700
The Lord's great grace has taught me

5
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:02,205
The Lord has bestowed on us his grace

6
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:08,378
When I feel the Lord's miraculous love

7
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:13,216
The Lord's boundless grace

8
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:19,305
When I follow the Lord

9
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:23,935
He answers my prayers

10
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:30,066
When I follow the Lord

11
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,028
He gives me peace

12
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:40,743
When I follow the Lord

13
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:45,248
He answers my prayers

14
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:51,254
When I follow the Lord

15
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:56,134
He gives me peace

16
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:07,854
REVELATIONS

17
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,193
Hello, sir. You're here.
Let's go and grab a bite to eat.

18
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,738
That man followed you?

19
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:18,281
Hey, don't look.

20
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,868
You're popular, A-yeong.
Did that old man follow you?

21
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,077
Got a death wish?

22
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,122
It's gotten a lot better.

23
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,626
-I see.
-Yes.

24
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,003
Sorry, one moment.

25
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,838
Hello.

26
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:38,009
Is this your first time here?

27
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:42,347
Hello, I'm Sung Min-chan,
the pastor in charge here.

28
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:46,267
Oh, I was just passing by
and saw this church, so…

29
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,186
I see.

30
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:52,315
Would you like a cup of coffee?

31
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,650
No, I…

32
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,736
I have business to attend to.

33
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:57,820
Wait.

34
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,448
Please stay for some coffee.

35
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,418
-I swear, he followed me.
-It's just your imagination.

36
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,255
-Sorry.
-Sorry about that.

37
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,263
Are you all right?

38
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:27,475
Are you sick? Should I call an ambulance?

39
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:30,937
No, I'm fine.

40
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:38,319
Let's go.

41
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,297
Take care.

42
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,716
-I'll see you at the next service.
-Yeah.

43
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:07,307
The large should fit you well.

44
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:11,561
I know you joined us on a whim today,
but I hope to see you again.

45
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,190
Do you live in the area?

46
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:17,692
Yes, I do.

47
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,277
Then do come by again.

48
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,362
It'd be nice to see you regularly.

49
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:24,907
Do you go to church?

50
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,454
I used to, when I was a kid.

51
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:30,580
I see.

52
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:34,917
It's not unusual to attend church
regularly as a child

53
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,462
and become less involved as you get older.

54
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:38,880
There are those phases.

55
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,257
You see,

56
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,633
in that process,

57
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:46,012
you receive revelations and come to accept
God's calling for your life.

58
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:51,434
I just realized I never asked your name.

59
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,727
May I have your name?

60
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,107
My name is Kwon Yang-rae.

61
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,361
Mr. Kwon Yang-rae.

62
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,653
What is that?

63
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,491
Well, this is…

64
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,493
REGISTRATION FORM

65
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,790
This is our new member registration form.

66
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:14,791
You know,

67
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:18,878
we never needed this back in the day,
but everything's digitized now.

68
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:23,674
So, these things do come in handy
from time to time.

69
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:28,012
We're a new church, so…

70
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,056
Gosh, this is embarrassing.

71
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:30,973
Look.

72
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:36,062
Like I said, I just dropped in
because I was passing by.

73
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,442
But this isn't a complicated form.

74
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,944
I mean…

75
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:48,366
It's simple.
We just need your name and number.

76
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,784
It's nothing.

77
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:53,079
Oh, right. Hold on.

78
00:06:56,541 --> 00:07:00,211
A photo would be very helpful as well.

79
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:03,881
I'll delete this as soon as I print it.

80
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,472
See? I deleted it.

81
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,102
Oh, no.

82
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:20,440
I have to make an urgent call.
I'll be right back.

83
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:24,861
This is just a simple form,
so please fill it out.

84
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,488
I'll be right back.

85
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,767
Hello, sir.

86
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,895
Hello. So?

87
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,438
Your hunch was right.

88
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:04,650
I think your wife's been seeing
her personal trainer for quite a while.

89
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,236
They meet up about three times a week.

90
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,864
I'll send you some photos now.
Check them out.

91
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,492
You're working too hard.

92
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,495
Not at all.
I can't thank you enough for your help.

93
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,595
So? Should I gather additional evidence?

94
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:37,350
By "additional evidence,"
what exactly do you mean…

95
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,853
They meet often, so the next time
I see them go into a motel,

96
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,398
I can take pictures and videos of them
making out and having sex

97
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,485
and also look for
condoms or tissues with semen.

98
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,737
Of course, if they don't use condoms,

99
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,783
my boys can find and collect traces
of semen on your wife's body,

100
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,576
so don't you worry.

101
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,329
So, should I gather more evidence or not?

102
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,831
Hello? Sir?

103
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:15,513
Oh, you're leaving already?

104
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,808
Well, I have some business to attend to.

105
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,435
I've filled out the form.

106
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,688
My shoes…

107
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,565
Here.

108
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:31,362
Don't fold down the back of your shoes.
You'll ruin them.

109
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:32,738
Here, put them on.

110
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,085
Church is…

111
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,133
a place for sinners.

112
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:58,055
God loves us all.

113
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,581
That man…

114
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,208
Did he register?

115
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,920
Well, kind of.

116
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,633
Honey, you should get going.

117
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,886
-Yeah. Get ready and meet me outside.
-All right.

118
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:21,972
Hi, Dad.

119
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,434
Now?

120
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,190
No, I'll join you.

121
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,984
All right. I'll be home soon.

122
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,466
You can just drop me off
at the subway station.

123
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,638
What's this school reunion for?

124
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,308
It's a college reunion.

125
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:08,602
I told you, didn't I?

126
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,524
I might be home a little late.
Can you pick up Yeon-u?

127
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:21,657
My gosh.
They're here building on a Sunday?

128
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,326
Well, actually,

129
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:28,873
I hope they work hard and finish soon
so we can get new church members.

130
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,012
What's that?

131
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,264
Hold on. Pull over.

132
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,488
HEAVENSFOLK CHURCH

133
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,698
I guess they're building
a new church here.

134
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:09,789
Hold on. What?

135
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,123
Pastor Jung's listed!

136
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,333
OWNER: JUNG GUK-HWAN

137
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,044
Oh, my gosh.

138
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,880
Maybe he's going to ask you
to come and lead this church.

139
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,842
He brought you here
and told you to grow that tiny church.

140
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,552
This was his plan.

141
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:28,182
You picked up everyone
attending morning prayer for four years.

142
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,100
It's finally paying off, you know?

143
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,231
You should pay him a visit today
and gauge his reaction.

144
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,315
Okay?

145
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:54,500
I'm home.

146
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:58,337
I guess you didn't have to work today.
It's not raining now.

147
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,882
They sent us home early
before the rain starts.

148
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,718
The assistant manager will wrap things up.

149
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,847
Come on. Let's eat.

150
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,100
What's all this? You cooked up a banquet.

151
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,352
Tomorrow's your first day on the new team.

152
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:14,770
You should have some meat.

153
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,398
It's no big deal.

154
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,525
Is the construction almost done?

155
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,485
The scaffolding's coming down in two days.

156
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,487
Then, it's almost done.

157
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:28,242
Anyway, you were on a good team,

158
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,411
and there are easier paths to promotion.

159
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,331
Did you have to volunteer
to join the Violent Crimes Unit?

160
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,959
Well, it's nice.

161
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:40,337
It's closer to home.
My commute was stressful.

162
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:47,845
That bastard, Kwon Yang-rae,
has been released. He lives nearby.

163
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,723
Really?

164
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,435
You knew, didn't you?

165
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,939
This is good. Did you buy the marinade?

166
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,276
Stop trying to change the subject.

167
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:06,530
You're not surveilling him, are you?

168
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,202
Let it go. Okay?

169
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,830
Put it behind you and live your life.

170
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,170
I'm curious to see how the building looks.

171
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,297
Show me once the scaffolding comes down.

172
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,841
You know you're all I have now.

173
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,011
If something bad happens to you too…

174
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,064
You do the dishes.

175
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:53,494
SKY PEACE CHURCH

176
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:56,580
Come in.

177
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:00,793
Pastor.

178
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,046
Hey, Pastor Sung.

179
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,882
Oh, no. Do you have a cold?

180
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:08,884
Have a seat.

181
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,971
You always work so hard.

182
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,722
You need to look after yourself.

183
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,725
I'm fine. It will go away soon.

184
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,938
Anyway, you've been working
very hard yourself.

185
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,773
How's the church doing?

186
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,400
Oh, it's nothing really.

187
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:31,532
Oh, I managed to register a new member
before coming here.

188
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,286
Don't get obsessed
with finding new members.

189
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,497
Just remember

190
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:43,043
that you're God's messenger
spreading his word on barren land.

191
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,088
Just remember that and keep going.

192
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,259
I will.

193
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:55,431
Oh, right. Was it "Heavensfolk Church"?

194
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,974
Yes, I guess you saw it.

195
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,225
Yes.

196
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:02,104
Well, my wife was more surprised
than I was.

197
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,233
You could've given me a heads-up.

198
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,111
Sorry. I've been all over the place.

199
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,993
Who's the right person for that church?

200
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,206
Right person?

201
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,543
Well, for the church you just mentioned.
Heavensfolk Church.

202
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:28,547
You've been in that area for a long time,
so I figured I should ask you.

203
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:32,843
Who would be the right person
as the pastor in charge?

204
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:36,847
Oh, as the pastor in charge…

205
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,977
Is there anyone who comes to mind?

206
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,275
I'm not sure, but…

207
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,114
I'll think about it.

208
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:55,741
All right.

209
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,451
Let's put our thinking caps on.

210
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,541
God will show us
who the right person is for the job.

211
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,672
Hurry! I told you to bring your umbrella.

212
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,675
Go inside first. Go on in. Quick.

213
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,845
Oh, Min-chan.

214
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,263
Hey, Hwan-su.

215
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,515
Just a minute.

216
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:23,143
It's been so long. What brings you here?

217
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:26,063
Oh, I came to see Pastor Jung.
I'm leaving now.

218
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,440
I see. You came to see my father.

219
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,568
Hey, you probably know

220
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,279
that he's building a new church
in your neighborhood.

221
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:37,866
Oh, yes. I heard.

222
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:42,746
The church elders keep saying I should
lead that church. I'm in a pickle.

223
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,375
I see.

224
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:50,838
Your father told me he was looking
for the right person to lead the church.

225
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:54,007
He asked for my opinion.

226
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,218
He asked you for your opinion?

227
00:18:56,844 --> 00:19:00,013
What was he thinking, asking you about it?

228
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,643
What's wrong with him?
He's making things awkward.

229
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:07,729
Of course, you're the right person.

230
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,065
You've been spreading His word there
for years.

231
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,528
And let's be honest, what do I even know?

232
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,196
I am definitely underqualified.

233
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,993
I should go talk to my father.

234
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,703
No, don't.

235
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:26,498
It's not like it's our call.

236
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:30,377
God will show us the right person.

237
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,337
-We should just--
-Pastor, we'll be going then.

238
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,422
Wait up.

239
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:37,134
Anyway, I have to go.
I'll call you. We'll talk again.

240
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,052
-Keep up the good work.
-All right, bye.

241
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,846
Sorry. Let's go.

242
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:03,994
Dear Heavenly Father, please watch over me

243
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:07,331
so my pure faith in you,
my Lord, who carries all my burdens,

244
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:11,627
is no longer shaken
by worldly temptations.

245
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,421
But, Lord,

246
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:21,053
if my leading the new church
does not go against your will,

247
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:25,599
I'd like to take on this new challenge,
dare I confess.

248
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,436
Please show me your will…

WIFE
LEE SI-YEONG

250
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:44,660
Hello?

251
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,953
Where are you?

252
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,621
Are you with Yeon-u now?

253
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,166
Yeon-u? What are you talking about?

254
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,212
I asked you to pick up Yeon-u
because of my college reunion.

255
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:01,468
Right. There was
something I had to do, so--

256
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:04,513
What did you have to do?
The service ended hours ago!

257
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:08,725
Then what do we do? What should we do?

258
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,561
What's wrong? What did the daycare say?

259
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:14,564
They said some man came and took Yeon-u.

260
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,652
I assumed it was you.

261
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,237
What do we do?

262
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,073
Yeon-u's been kidnapped!
What should we do?

263
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:30,539
Honey, go to the daycare
and ask them what he looked like.

264
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,501
If something happens to Yeon-u,
it's all on you.

265
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,086
Do you hear me?

269
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,060
Hey, Yeon-ju.

270
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,896
Are you still not talking to Dad?

271
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:38,231
You should call him.

272
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,819
Okay, I will.

273
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,155
Hey, what's wrong?

274
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,366
Are you feeling sick?

275
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,203
Yeon-ju?

276
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,288
No.

277
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,457
I just woke up.

278
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,669
You just woke up?
Do you know what time it is?

279
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:02,297
You said you'd cut your commute
so you could study more.

280
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,508
Are you studying hard?

281
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,635
Yes.

282
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,054
I'll call you back later.

283
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,808
All right.
Call me if you need me for anything.

284
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,528
Yeon-hui.

285
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:33,537
Yeon-hui, do you remember?

286
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,958
The day I moved into my place.

287
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:42,921
We had a housewarming party
and took this picture together.

288
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,591
It's a great picture of you.

289
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:53,014
But you know what?
I regret getting my own place.

290
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:09,823
Do you know what I kept thinking
when he was holding me captive?

291
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:14,161
"Someone will come and rescue me."

292
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,124
"My sister will get suspicious

293
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:25,422
because she's smart and goes
to the National Police University."

294
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:31,052
But…

295
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,931
the person walking through the door…

296
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,771
was always him.

297
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,567
Yeon-hui.

298
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,362
Why did you do that?

299
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:33,156
Why?

300
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:38,161
Why didn't you come to my rescue?

301
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,038
Why?

302
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:50,215
In ten meters,
you will arrive at your destination.

304
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,495
Hello, what's your emergency?

305
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,372
Yes, hello. I'm…

306
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,917
My kid has gone missing.

307
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,628
Your own child has gone missing?

308
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:31,047
Kwon… Kwon Yang-rae…

309
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:33,216
You know,
the rapist who lives in the area.

310
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,885
That rapist… I mean,
I'm in front of his house now.

311
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:38,430
-But I'm--
-Please calm down and explain.

312
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:40,974
I think he's planning
to dispose of something.

313
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,143
He has a shovel--

314
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:46,354
Sir, did you witness a crime?

315
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:50,150
No. Like I said, my kid has gone missing,
but right now--

316
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:51,985
When was your child last seen?

317
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:54,613
Kwon Yang-rae,
the rapist who lives in the area.

318
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,281
Look him up and you'll see!

319
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,658
Sir, have you reported your child missing?

320
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,670
Please send some officers
to Kwon's home now.

321
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:14,007
I'm now… Hello?

00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,493
I believe you've been following me.

325
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,411
What's going on?

326
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:07,555
If you don't have anything to say,
I'll just head home.

327
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:18,650
Yeon-u.

328
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,152

329
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:23,738

00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,285
Pastor.

331
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,790
What are you doing?

332
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,129
Move.

335
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:36,496
I found Yeon-u.

336
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,999
You know Yeon-u's friend No-el, right?

337
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:43,419
No-el invited Yeon-u over,
so No-el's dad picked them up.

338
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:48,383
He told the teacher, but the message
was lost during the shift handover.

339
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:54,347
Anyway, No-el's parents
should've called us to let us know.

340
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:57,934
If I'd told you, you would've told me
not to play with No-el.

341
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:01,187
I told you to keep your hands up.

342
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,648
Stop your crying!

343
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,566
Where are you?

344
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:24,038
Inspector Lee Yeon-hui?

345
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,625
Hello, ma'am.

346
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:30,920
I'm So Eun-gyu, Assistant Inspector
for Violent Crimes Unit 4.

347
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:33,881
-Oh, hello.
-The captain is asking for you.

348
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:37,260
There's a new case,
and everyone is in the briefing room.

349
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,344
Let's go.

350
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:39,428
Okay.

351
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,765
It's not a simple missing person case.

352
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:44,892
Oh, there they are.

353
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,644
Before we start the briefing,

354
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:49,981
meet Inspector Lee Yeon-hui,
a new member of Violent Crimes Unit 4.

355
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:51,149
Say hello.

356
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,194
We landed a big case last night,
so it's a bit hectic.

357
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,821
Okay, listen first.

358
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,031
At 10:30 p.m. last night,

359
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:02,451
Sung Min-chan,
the head of Mission Nation Church,

360
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,120
called the police.

361
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:08,541
He said Kwon Yang-rae,
a two-time convicted sex offender,

362
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:13,004
who wears an ankle monitor and
lives nearby, might be up to something.

363
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,216
Kwon cut off his ankle monitor
and has disappeared.

364
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,845
And a middle school girl
has been reported missing.

365
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:23,181
Name, Shin A-yeong.

366
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,683
She also attends
the Mission Nation Church.

367
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:28,811
After the service,
she and her friends went to karaoke,

368
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:31,189
but she never returned home.

369
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:34,775
Unit 1, start interviewing
Shin A-yeong's friends.

370
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:35,860
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

371
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:39,197
Unit 4, you guys interview the man
who made the report last night.

372
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,490
Get moving.

373
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:05,223
We are now blocking off
8-gil, Myeonghwa-ro.

374
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,433
The CSI unit will be here in five minutes.

375
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,689
-You're here.
-Yes, hi.

376
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:18,694
-Oh, man.
-I think Kwon did live here.

377
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:21,364
But I don't know how, given the condition.

378
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:24,283
What? There's no power?

379
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,744
No. The electricity has been cut off.

380
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,794
Hey, try moving all the furniture
out of the room.

381
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,420
Yes, sir. Hey, give me a hand.

382
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,354
Sir.

383
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:04,073
This bastard is a real sicko.

384
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,290
SENTENCE FOR INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER

385
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:26,012
SENTENCE FOR INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER
TURN ONESELF IN

386
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:39,734
Hello?

387
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,156
Yes, hello.

388
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:48,451
Are you Mr. Sung Min-chan?

389
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,996
Yes. How may I help you?

390
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,497
We're police officers.

391
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:57,335
We're here because you called us
to report Kwon Yang-rae last night.

392
00:38:57,418 --> 00:39:00,755
You said it looked like
he was going to get rid of a dead body.

393
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:02,757
Oh, right.

394
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:08,804
The thing is, Kwon Yang-rae
came to my church yesterday.

395
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:12,308
I noticed he had
an electronic ankle monitor.

396
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:14,810
It surprised me.

397
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:18,564
Then I got a call
saying my kid had gone missing.

398
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:22,234
For a moment, I suspected Kwon Yang-rae,
so I went to his house.

399
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,319
Then…

400
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:26,322
Then what?

401
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:29,492
Well, I saw him holding a shovel.

402
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:35,164
I assumed he was about to get rid
of a body, so I called the police.

403
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,167
Then what about your child?

404
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,044
Oh, we…

405
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,338
We were mistaken. Well…

406
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:48,427
We found out later
that he was at a friend's house.

407
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:49,762
I see.

408
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:56,394
A middle school girl named Shin A-yeong
has gone missing.

409
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:59,647
Wait, the A-yeong who attends this church?

410
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,315
Yes.

411
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:06,570
What? What happened to A-yeong…

412
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,030
May I look around this room?

413
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:11,075
Yes, sure.

414
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:26,632
How long was Kwon here?

415
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:31,011
I asked him to fill out
our new member registration form,

416
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,807
then he left
when I stepped out to take a call.

417
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:59,540
Pastor, what did you do
after you reported it?

418
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,918
I went home.

419
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:20,519
Mind you, we have no evidence of him
doing anything to her yet.

420
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,271
We're investigating it now.

421
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:27,401
Please give us a call
if you remember anything else.

422
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,069
Will do.

423
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:43,936
PASTOR, I HAVE A CONFESSION TO MAKE

424
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:53,153
YESTERDAY, I…

425
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:59,201
MIN-CHAN… LET'S TALK IN PERSON.
COME TO MY CHURCH NOW…

426
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,244
Pastor.

427
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,915
There's a big problem.

428
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,879
I guess you already heard…

429
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,175
about Hwan-su.

430
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:08,145
I taught him to always do what is right.

431
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:17,279
What was he thinking,
dating a church member?

432
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:27,289
He hasn't even been married that long.

433
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:30,751
Well,

434
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,797
you know how soft Hwan-su is.

435
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,175
He's too soft for his own good.

436
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:40,719
That's why he let her seduce him.

437
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:46,016
Anyway, I told him to end things with her
as soon as possible.

438
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:51,397
I said he should go back to his wife
and repent, but that girl…

439
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:53,607
The girl he's been seeing

440
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:58,529
posted details of their relationship
on the church's website.

441
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,699
Look at what she wrote.

442
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:05,327
I'm telling you.
She approached him on purpose!

443
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:11,291
My goodness…

444
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,379
As for Hwan-su…

445
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:21,176
I'm going to send him abroad
for a few years to do missionary work.

446
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,847
So he can get away from all this.

447
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,143
This is crazy.

448
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:41,572
How could he be blinded by lust
when his duty is to serve God?

449
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:49,121
I always told him to live his life for God
and nothing else.

450
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,046
Min-chan,

451
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:01,508
maybe it was

452
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:05,512
all part of God's plan.

453
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:09,433
Pastor.

454
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:17,733
Don't you smell something sweet?

455
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:22,488
About Heavensfolk Church,
the church I'm building now…

456
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:28,869
I'm hoping you can lead the church
as the pastor in charge.

457
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,799
I suppose that is God's will.

458
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,178
And we must follow His will.

459
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:49,014
Min-chan.

460
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:53,477
Lead Heavensfolk Church

461
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,772
and do your best to grow it.

462
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,443
I will follow.

463
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,989
I will follow…

464
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,452
God's will.

465
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:22,714
Kwon's probation officer said
he showed no indications at all.

466
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,883
And he worked hard
at the demolition company.

467
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:27,553
Right, and he hasn't missed
a single session with me.

468
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:30,639
His condition had improved significantly.

469
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:33,892
Do you know when he drew this?

470
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,978
Our forensic team's working on it now,

471
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:38,897
but it looked like it was drawn recently.

472
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:39,982
Recently?

473
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:43,861
He showed no indications

474
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:46,530
but committed another crime?

475
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:54,538
He must be Kwon's psychiatrist.

476
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:01,086
Mental illness can be caused
by many things,

477
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:03,005
including genetic factors.

478
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:06,133
It's hard to narrow it down
to one specific cause,

479
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:11,680
but being abused by his stepfather
as a kid must've played a key role.

480
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:13,056
How was he abused?

481
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:16,727
He was beaten,
ended up with a dent in his skull,

482
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,979
and his hand was dunked
into boiling water.

483
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:23,650
He was also waterboarded,
lying face up on the bathroom floor.

484
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,736
And he was sexually abused as well.

485
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:27,404
Thank you.

486
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:29,156
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

487
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:34,202
Mr. Kwon still has
over a hundred scars on his body

488
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,748
from the abuse he suffered for ten years.

489
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:41,752
After experiencing something like this,

490
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:44,588
is it possible to develop
into a well-adjusted adult?

491
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:48,717
Not everyone with such experiences
develops criminal tendencies.

492
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:52,930
However, I think
many things would've been different

493
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:55,140
had he been treated in time.

494
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:58,810
Mr. Kwon was abused for ten years.

495
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:02,272
It was when he was sent

496
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:06,401
to juvenile hall for assault at age 16
that he could finally escape his stepdad.

497
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:08,111
As a young boy, he was--

498
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:11,365
Wait, what are you doing?

499
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:12,491
Yeon-hui.

500
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:13,617
Order.

501
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,993
Why…

502
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:18,872
Why try to create an excuse
for someone like him?

503
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:23,502
-Did you smirk at me?
-Please remove her.

504
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:25,754
-Did you just smirk?
-Remove her!

505
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:27,255
-Let go!
-Come with us.

506
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:29,341
-Yeon-hui.
-That bastard is the devil!

507
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:30,676
-He's the devil!
-Come on.

508
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:33,345
-Whose side are you on?
-Please calm down.

509
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:35,472
Let go of me! I said let go!

510
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:36,556
Let go!

511
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,308
Dr. Lee Nak-seong.

512
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:41,603
It's been a while.

513
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:43,689
Lee Yeon-hui,
from the Violent Crimes Unit.

514
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:49,486
Wait, have we met before?

515
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:52,572
You must remember

516
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,741
Kwon Yang-rae's case from five years ago.

517
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:59,830
Lee Yeon-ju, who was abused
while being held against her will

518
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:02,541
but managed to escape and call the police.

519
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:06,503
I'm her sister.

520
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:10,424
I've always wanted
to ask you this question.

521
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,301
Why did you do that back then?

522
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:17,097
Why did you create a reason
for Kwon to get away with it?

523
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,308
You see, back then…

524
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:23,937
I testified as an expert witness.

525
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,772
You know I'm a psychiatrist, right?

526
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:29,985
I study and treat mental illnesses.

527
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:31,111
You treat them?

528
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:33,321
And after all those years of treatment,

529
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:35,741
why is Shin A-yeong missing?

530
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:38,535
It's all your fault.

531
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:42,831
Because you created an excuse
for that devil.

532
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:48,086
That's why this happened again,
after just a few years.

533
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:50,088
He's not the devil.

534
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:54,801
Kwon is just a human being, a broken one.

535
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:57,429
If you want to save Shin A-yeong,

536
00:50:57,512 --> 00:51:00,223
you need to learn more about Kwon.

537
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:03,602
As the victim's family,
I understand why you feel that way.

538
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:05,854
I get it, but as a detective…

539
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:11,276
I should get going.

540
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:16,490
His story went viral after the trial!

541
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:20,744
Everyone talked
as though he deserved pity.

542
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,663
As if he had no choice…

543
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:24,956
SYMPATHY FOR THE OFFENDER

544
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,416
…but to turn out like that.

545
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:29,169
Shortly after that,

546
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:31,922
my sister, Yeon-ju,

547
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:34,883
took her own life.

548
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:39,846
She survived horrible torture and escaped.

549
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,181
But you…

550
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,184
You killed her.

551
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:22,639
Pastor.

552
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:27,978
Pastor. Pastor Sung, right?

553
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:33,233
-How may I help you?
-I'm A-yeong's mother.

554
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:36,486
Oh! Yes.

555
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:37,946
What brings you here?

556
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:41,575
A-yeong… Why is my daughter…

557
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:44,161
My gosh, ma'am.

558
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:47,164
Let's go inside and talk. Come with me.

559
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:48,623
Why my daughter…

560
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:59,009
Ma'am. We will find A-yeong for sure.

561
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:02,470
Yes, we have to.

562
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:06,183
But, Pastor…

563
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:08,602
If…

564
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,354
Just hypothetically…

565
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:15,734
What if something has already happened
to A-yeong?

566
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:18,153
What are you saying?
Don't think like that.

567
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:19,487
I know, but if…

568
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:22,032
What if…

569
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:24,910
If I suddenly get a call from the police

570
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:29,831
and hear that something happened
and that I have to confirm it's her--

571
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:32,792
You must stay strong, ma'am.
A-yeong is alive.

572
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:37,797
Right? She must be. Right, Pastor Sung?

573
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,507
-Right?
-Yes. Of course she is.

574
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:42,260
Let's pray together.

575
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:48,308
Our living God, the Lord our shepherd.

576
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:52,896
You guide and protect us
every step of the way,

577
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,232
so you must know where A-yeong is

578
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:59,236
and what kind of situation she's in now.

579
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:02,280
Even if your little lamb, A-yeong,
is in a dark place now,

580
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:05,116
we believe that she is alive
and that you are with her.

581
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,827
Lord, please remember
this difficult moment.

582
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,163
We earnestly seek the Lord's help.

583
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:14,209
This is from a camera near Kwon's home
a day before his disappearance.

584
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:18,630
He deliberately damaged four cameras
near his home over the weekend.

585
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:22,801
It seems that he came up
with a thorough plan a few days prior.

586
00:54:22,884 --> 00:54:27,013
Well, what was the control center doing
while he broke four security cameras?

587
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:30,642
They thought the lightning
and heavy rain broke them.

588
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:33,270
Any home security cameras
or dashcams in the vicinity?

589
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:36,773
We checked but couldn't secure a visual
because of the rain.

590
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:38,775
This is nuts.

591
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:40,485
Yes.

592
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:42,612
Oh, okay. Got it.

593
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:45,115
-Captain, they found Kwon's car.
-Where?

594
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:47,117
Near Foxhill Pass on Cheonil Mountain.

595
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,495
-Hey, get moving. Go!
-Yes, sir.

596
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:01,089
I can just take the bus, you know.

597
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:05,051
No way. Of course I'll take you home.

598
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,763
You must stay strong, okay?

599
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:19,065
Ma'am, how about
we all pray together tonight?

600
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:25,530
Everyone who loves A-yeong
will come together and pray for her.

601
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:26,740
-Then I'm sure--
-Hello?

602
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:31,369
What about A-yeong?

603
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:35,915
No, I'll come now too.

604
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,960
No. I said, I'll come now too!

605
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:41,463
Send me the address.

606
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:45,550
What was that about?

607
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:48,011
They found that bastard's car.

608
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:51,056
What do I do?

609
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:54,392
What do I do?

610
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:57,812
Where is it?

611
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:15,288
Starting the search in Zone A-3.

612
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,624
-Forensics is on it.
-We haven't found anything.

613
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:18,708
Copy that.

614
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:20,585
Something will come up.
Find anything you can.

615
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:21,669
Yes, sir.

616
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:25,006
Please send an additional unit
to Zone A-4.

617
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,091
Okay.

618
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:28,843
Are all officers and detectives present?

619
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:32,097
That bastard… I wonder why he came here.

620
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:35,058
Where did he go after abandoning his car?

621
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:39,396
Do you think A-yeong escaped
on their way here?

622
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:40,647
Maybe.

623
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,984
Oh, my. What is this?

624
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:47,153
Find anything yet?

625
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,089
Forensics!

626
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:18,101
Search over there too!

627
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:21,604
-Found anything?
-Not yet!

628
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:37,454
I know. I'm her dad. Let me in.

629
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:39,372
Please, why are you being like this?

630
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:40,457
Please stop!

631
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:43,293
Please let me in, just for a moment.

632
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:45,211
-Honey!
-You can't go in!

633
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,588
-Move!
-You can't--

634
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:47,589
Where is A-yeong?

635
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:49,716
They're still searching.
Let's go that way.

636
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:51,092
-A-yeong!
-You can't go in.

637
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:54,387
We are A-yeong's parents!
You need to tell us what's going on!

638
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:55,972
A-yeong!

639
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:56,973
What's going on?

640
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:00,685
-A-yeong!
-They're Shin A-yeong's parents.

641
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:03,605
-We'll look for her. Please!
-A-yeong! A-yeong!

642
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:06,816
Guys, it's okay.
Hello, you must be A-yeong's parents.

643
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:09,444
Have you found my daughter yet?

644
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:12,071
No, not yet.
We haven't found any clues yet.

645
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:13,406
But you found his car.

646
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:16,618
Right, we did,
but we are still investigating.

647
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:19,662
And no body either?

648
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,168
"Body"?

649
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:27,962
"Body"? Do you mean…

650
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:34,135
Is my daughter…
Does it mean A-yeong is… A-yeong!

651
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:35,595
-Honey!
-Ma'am!

652
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:38,515
-Medics!
-Here, over here!

653
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:42,143
Honey, are you okay? Stay with me.

654
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:45,188
Man, what are we going to do?

655
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:51,903
He broke all the cameras,
so we can't find any leads.

656
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:55,949
Hey, was there no dashcam in his car?

657
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,825
No, no dashcam.

658
00:58:57,909 --> 00:59:00,620
-So, we've found no evidence?
-No.

659
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:04,040
It rained a lot yesterday,
so I'd be surprised if we found anything.

660
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,544
Seems like the universe
is helping that bastard.

661
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:46,874
What's gotten into you?

662
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:50,587
You never liked volunteering
at the care home

663
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,547
because of the pastors' wives
and their politics.

664
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:57,510
Aren't you holding a prayer service
for A-yeong?

665
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:58,970
You should get ready.

666
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:00,680
Si-yeong.

667
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:03,683
Don't you have anything to tell me?

668
01:00:05,476 --> 01:00:06,477
What?

669
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:12,233
Don't you have anything to confess?

670
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:14,777
Confess? About what?

671
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:31,294
Si-yeong.

672
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:35,506
It's all my fault.

673
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,344
I caused all of this.

674
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:42,597
But…

675
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:46,059
I've repented for everything.

676
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:51,939
It's your turn now.

677
01:00:53,274 --> 01:00:54,692
Got anything to tell me?

678
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:57,362
What are you saying?

679
01:00:57,445 --> 01:00:58,529
Damn it!

680
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:03,701
Listen carefully.

681
01:01:05,703 --> 01:01:08,498
That new church they are building.

682
01:01:08,581 --> 01:01:11,000
Pastor Jung asked me
to be the pastor in charge.

683
01:01:14,962 --> 01:01:16,714
Actually, I looked into it.

684
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:19,926
Everyone else knows
Hwan-su is getting that church.

685
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:22,804
Did you say
Jung Guk-hwan was your spiritual father?

686
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:25,390
-You're so ridiculously gullible--
-Hey.

687
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:29,227
Watch what you say.

688
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:35,608
He's sending Hwan-su abroad
to do missionary work.

689
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:37,652
You know why?

690
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:42,073
He had an affair.

691
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:45,660
He committed adultery.

692
01:01:57,422 --> 01:01:59,507
Hey, I'm sorry.

693
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:05,096
But you see, this is God's revelation.

694
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:07,265
If we want to receive this revelation,

695
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:11,436
we must become pure before God,
completely free from guilt.

696
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:16,691
Si-yeong.

697
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:20,361
Got anything to confess?

698
01:02:22,947 --> 01:02:25,199
I…

699
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,786
I have to go.

700
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:38,212
God knows everything.

701
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:43,050
There's nothing He doesn't know.

702
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:52,602
Confess.

703
01:02:59,525 --> 01:03:02,361
I committed adultery.

704
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:08,034
Louder.

705
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:11,329
Almighty God.

706
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,958
I committed adultery.

707
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:17,376
Louder!

708
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:20,087
Say it louder
so your confession can reach God.

709
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:24,759
Almighty God, I committed adultery.

710
01:03:24,842 --> 01:03:26,344
-Amen!
-Amen.

711
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:28,429
Amen!

712
01:03:29,096 --> 01:03:29,931
Amen!

713
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:32,725
-Amen! Almighty God.
-Amen, amen…

714
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:39,065
This lost sheep repents
of her sin and begs.

715
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:42,443
Please hear our earnest repentance
for our sins.

716
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:44,028
Almighty God…

717
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:52,870
Sir, it's completely stuck.

718
01:04:01,045 --> 01:04:03,673
Hello, do you need a hand?

719
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:05,258
No, it's okay.

720
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:08,803
The tow truck's about to get here, thanks.

721
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:12,557
-All right, then.
-Be careful. The road is narrow.

722
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:28,364
YEONGJIN ASSISTED LIVING CENTER

723
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:31,158
-My gosh.
-Ma'am.

724
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:34,245
-Hello.
-You're early.

725
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:37,248
Goodness, Pastor Sung.
What brings you here?

726
01:04:37,331 --> 01:04:39,375
Did you just come to drop her off?

727
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:41,836
You two are still so in love.

728
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:44,839
It's all thanks to their faith.

729
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:47,383
You're filled with God's grace.

730
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:51,012
I should've arrived earlier
and prepared everything.

731
01:04:51,095 --> 01:04:53,389
The caterer will take care of everything.

732
01:04:53,472 --> 01:04:56,100
We'll just watch them cook

733
01:04:56,183 --> 01:04:58,477
and talk about
how there's so much evil in the world.

734
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:00,021
-My Lord…
-What's taking them so long?

735
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:04,275
What is it? Is something the matter?

736
01:05:04,358 --> 01:05:07,111
No. How come the ambulance isn't here yet?

737
01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:11,032
Oh, we saw an ambulance on our way here.
It looked like there'd been an accident.

738
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:12,283
Oh, no.

739
01:05:12,366 --> 01:05:14,493
What's wrong? Is someone hurt?

740
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:18,247
Well, a man showed up earlier,
covered in dirt and blood.

741
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:22,084
He crawled here and passed out.
I think he's badly hurt.

742
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:24,337
He needs to be taken
to a main hospital now.

743
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:27,298
Something must've happened to him.

744
01:05:27,381 --> 01:05:29,800
I think he crawled here
from that mountain.

745
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:33,095
My goodness. That sounds serious.

746
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:34,722
Where is this man now?

747
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:38,726
We moved him to the ward upstairs
so he could lie down.

748
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:40,603
But if the ambulance isn't coming…

749
01:05:40,686 --> 01:05:45,441
Pastor Sung asked if they needed help,
and they said a tow truck was coming.

750
01:05:45,524 --> 01:05:46,525
That's a relief.

751
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:50,613
Oh, ladies. Don't you need to oversee them
set up the cafeteria?

752
01:05:50,696 --> 01:05:53,449
Yes, let's do that. We should get changed.

753
01:05:53,532 --> 01:05:56,035
-And take some pictures too.
-Yes.

754
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:58,788
You should go inside. I'll get going.

755
01:05:58,871 --> 01:06:00,998
Why? You should stay and eat with us.

756
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:04,961
I'm holding a prayer service this evening,
so I should get ready.

757
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:06,712
All right, then.

758
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:10,132
Then I'll take you to the room
next to the cafeteria. Come with me.

759
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:13,844
-Go on in.
-All right.

760
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:35,384
A pastor…

761
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:39,680
A pastor tried to…

762
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:46,020
A pastor tried to kill me…

763
01:08:30,564 --> 01:08:31,899
This isn't my will.

764
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:34,318
It's all God's will.

765
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:11,397
You took so long!

766
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,065
-Where's the patient?
-Upstairs.

767
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:40,050
Quickly. This way.

768
01:09:43,804 --> 01:09:45,139
So, it was this man?

769
01:09:46,974 --> 01:09:47,975
Yes, that's him.

770
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:53,105
We had no idea he was a criminal.
We even gave him first aid.

771
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:55,816
That must be why he fled.

772
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:58,277
-Can we see the ward where he was?
-Sure.

773
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:03,991
It's this way.

774
01:10:09,914 --> 01:10:12,666
Can we check the footage
from that camera up there?

775
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:16,003
Oh, that camera is very old.
It doesn't actually work.

776
01:10:17,004 --> 01:10:18,672
Could we get in trouble for that?

777
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:21,717
We're struggling
to keep this place running.

778
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:24,053
We don't really know
the laws related to that.

779
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:27,097
He was here.

780
01:10:30,809 --> 01:10:31,977
He took him.

781
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:35,314
Someone took him?

782
01:10:36,023 --> 01:10:37,274
Who?

783
01:10:45,866 --> 01:10:48,369
God took him.

784
01:10:49,161 --> 01:10:50,913
Amen.

785
01:10:50,996 --> 01:10:54,667
Sir, did you just say "amen"?
You hated the church.

786
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:56,919
What a surprise.

787
01:10:57,670 --> 01:11:00,714
Well, I must believe in God
to meet an angel!

788
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:02,925
He's had dementia for over 20 years.

789
01:11:03,008 --> 01:11:06,053
Yes, that's right. We believe you, sir.

790
01:11:08,347 --> 01:11:11,433
How many ways in and out are there?
Is there a back door?

791
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:13,936
One over here and an exit by the kitchen.

792
01:11:14,019 --> 01:11:14,937
I see.

793
01:11:15,646 --> 01:11:19,400
Before You, our hearts…

794
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:21,485
Who are they?

795
01:11:21,568 --> 01:11:25,906
Oh, they're pastors' wives who come here
to volunteer on a regular basis.

796
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:30,035
Could we get a list of their churches?

797
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:31,370
Yes, of course.

798
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:38,002
Giver of immortal gladness

799
01:11:38,085 --> 01:11:42,589
Fill us with the light of day

800
01:11:57,146 --> 01:12:00,774
You must be surprised to see me.
You managed to survive, but I showed up.

801
01:12:01,525 --> 01:12:02,526
You…

802
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:05,988
Why are you doing this to me?

803
01:12:07,448 --> 01:12:08,490
Good question.

804
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:11,952
I'm really curious too.

805
01:12:12,911 --> 01:12:16,582
Why does the Lord
keep leading me back to you?

806
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:19,335
Why?

807
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:24,506
I hadn't been
to that care home for a while.

808
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:28,594
When I woke up this morning,
I suddenly wanted to go there.

809
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:31,889
Why?

810
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:34,099
Why today of all days?

811
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:42,691
The day of Pentecost.

812
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:44,777
The anointing of the Holy Spirit!

813
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:48,489
God sent me the Holy Spirit
and led me there.

814
01:12:48,572 --> 01:12:49,573
Holy Spirit?

815
01:12:50,824 --> 01:12:56,455
You're just trying to hide the fact
that you tried to kill me.

816
01:12:56,538 --> 01:12:59,041
Hold on.

817
01:12:59,124 --> 01:13:01,168
It's all clear to me now.

818
01:13:02,753 --> 01:13:07,216
Now I know why God keeps leading me
to a man who is Satan's spawn.

819
01:13:08,175 --> 01:13:13,222
He wants to see
how faithfully I can follow his orders.

820
01:13:21,522 --> 01:13:22,731
I mean, this place too.

821
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:29,655
A new golf course was announced,
so they rushed to build this hotel.

822
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:31,323
But the developer went bankrupt.

823
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:33,492
It's been abandoned for over three years.

824
01:13:35,536 --> 01:13:39,623
Who knew this creepy derelict building
would be so useful to us?

825
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:43,252
God prepared this for us.

826
01:13:43,335 --> 01:13:44,503
It's God's providence!

827
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:51,760
Isn't it truly marvelous?

828
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:58,600
You… You're a total lunatic.

829
01:14:01,812 --> 01:14:02,813
So?

830
01:14:04,064 --> 01:14:05,399
Are you going to kill me?

831
01:14:06,525 --> 01:14:07,526
I don't know.

832
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:11,655
God will give me another revelation.

833
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:17,202
We are God's servants who obey His orders.

834
01:14:20,372 --> 01:14:21,790
If you kill me,

835
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:25,210
you'll never find that girl.

836
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:29,006
The one I kidnapped…

837
01:14:29,089 --> 01:14:29,923
What?

838
01:14:30,507 --> 01:14:32,426
The girl who goes to your church.

839
01:14:33,427 --> 01:14:34,720
She's alive.

840
01:14:42,644 --> 01:14:43,812
Where is A-yeong?

841
01:14:45,856 --> 01:14:47,357
Call the police,

842
01:14:48,442 --> 01:14:50,360
and I'll confess everything.

843
01:15:12,216 --> 01:15:13,634
Where is A-yeong?

844
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:17,304
If you kill me now,

845
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:20,432
you're also killing her.

846
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:28,941
Tell me where she is!

847
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:30,692
Call the police.

848
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:33,028
What's wrong? Are you scared?

849
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:48,919
Glory to Jesus, who died on the cross

850
01:15:49,002 --> 01:15:53,549
For our sins

851
01:15:54,424 --> 01:16:01,014
The cross he carried

852
01:16:01,098 --> 01:16:05,519
I will carry it now

853
01:16:05,602 --> 01:16:06,603
Amen!

854
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,315
His cross…

855
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:24,830
Where is A-yeong? Tell me!

856
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:32,421
Just call the police, you satanic bastard.

857
01:17:56,213 --> 01:17:57,839
Do we have their dashcam footage?

858
01:17:57,923 --> 01:18:00,550
Yes, everyone parked here
has given us their consent.

859
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:04,763
Go through the footage
as soon as you get to the office.

860
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:06,014
Lee Yeon-hui.

861
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:09,017
-You should call it a day, Inspector Lee.
-Pardon?

862
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:10,936
We can't throw you a welcome party,

863
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:14,022
but we can at least make sure
you don't work late on day one.

864
01:18:14,106 --> 01:18:15,857
There are only a few files anyway.

865
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:17,192
Go home and rest up.

866
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:18,944
Get going.

867
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:25,992
How long has it been
since she was last seen?

868
01:18:26,493 --> 01:18:28,495
It's been 24 hours, sir.

869
01:18:28,578 --> 01:18:32,082
The chances of her still being alive
are dropping dramatically.

870
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:04,281

Fill us with the light of day

875
01:19:21,965 --> 01:19:24,092
God took him.

876
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:30,682
And no body either?

877
01:20:02,422 --> 01:20:06,134
Pastor. A-yeong is okay, right?

878
01:20:06,718 --> 01:20:08,345
She'll be fine, won't she?

879
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:21,858
Thank you, Pastor.

880
01:20:22,859 --> 01:20:23,902
Let's go upstairs.

881
01:21:35,932 --> 01:21:38,059

MUSAN ORGANIC MULBERRY FARM

883
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:04,461
Today, we will read…

884
01:22:06,546 --> 01:22:11,468
Deuteronomy 24:7

885
01:22:12,969 --> 01:22:14,054
together.

886
01:22:17,390 --> 01:22:21,478
"If someone is caught kidnapping
a fellow Israelite

887
01:22:21,561 --> 01:22:26,858
and treating or selling them as a slave,

888
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:28,526
the kidnapper must…

889
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:30,987
die."

890
01:22:32,405 --> 01:22:36,326
"You must purge the evil from among you."

891
01:22:36,409 --> 01:22:38,119
-Amen.
-Amen.

892
01:22:38,203 --> 01:22:39,454
Amen.

893
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:46,670
Let us pray.

894
01:22:49,172 --> 01:22:50,340
Dear Heavenly Father.

895
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:57,013
Everyone who loves your little lamb,
Shin A-yeong, is here now.

896
01:22:57,597 --> 01:23:01,518
We know A-yeong is in heaven
watching over us.

897
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:05,105
And A-yeong's mother is
utterly devastated.

898
01:23:05,188 --> 01:23:09,234
Please allow her to feel
the sense of peace A-yeong is feeling now.

899
01:23:09,317 --> 01:23:10,860
Amen!

900
01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:15,949
We know that you never ignore
our sincere prayers and cries for help.

901
01:23:16,032 --> 01:23:16,866
Amen!

902
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:22,539
You never let evildoers go unpunished
and always purge all evil from this land.

903
01:23:22,622 --> 01:23:27,085
God, we remember your wrath,
your fairness, and your righteousness!

904
01:23:27,168 --> 01:23:28,211
Amen!

905
01:23:28,294 --> 01:23:33,299
You love the righteous,
but you hate sinners and detest sin!

906
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:38,513
You rained fire and sulfur
on Sodom and Gomorrah as punishment!

907
01:23:38,596 --> 01:23:41,975
Now, with your right hand
majestic in power,

908
01:23:42,058 --> 01:23:45,770
judge all that is evil
with your consuming fire!

909
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:48,106
Annihilate the sinner!

910
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:50,483
May your will be done!

911
01:23:51,317 --> 01:23:55,196
We will shout "Lord" three times
and pray together.

912
01:23:55,989 --> 01:23:58,324
-Lord!
-Lord!

913
01:23:58,408 --> 01:24:01,244
-Lord!
-Lord!

914
01:24:01,327 --> 01:24:04,622
-Lord!
-Lord!

915
01:24:09,502 --> 01:24:11,212
Lord!

916
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:16,760
-Lord, your eternal grace…
-Please, Lord!

917
01:24:34,194 --> 01:24:36,821
Amen.

918
01:24:41,534 --> 01:24:45,163
MUSAN ORGANIC MULBERRY FARM

919
01:26:44,115 --> 01:26:45,116
DETECTIVE SO EUN-GYU

920
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:46,492
Yeon-hui.

921
01:26:51,748 --> 01:26:52,790
Just kill him.

922
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:57,337
Now's your chance, Yeon-hui.

923
01:26:58,922 --> 01:27:00,006
Kill him.

924
01:27:02,008 --> 01:27:04,385
This is the moment
you've been waiting for.

925
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:08,306
Do it now.

926
01:27:13,603 --> 01:27:15,897
Don't you feel bad for me?

927
01:27:16,773 --> 01:27:18,650
I thought you wanted to avenge me!

928
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,903
Hurry up and do it. Now!

929
01:27:25,782 --> 01:27:27,408
That bastard is the devil.

930
01:27:27,992 --> 01:27:31,579
If you don't kill him now,
he'll go on to hurt more people.

931
01:27:31,663 --> 01:27:33,748
Kill him now!

932
01:27:36,125 --> 01:27:40,546
If you kill me, that girl will die too.

933
01:27:41,881 --> 01:27:43,466
Hurry up and call the police.

934
01:27:44,217 --> 01:27:46,552
She's still alive.

935
01:27:48,763 --> 01:27:50,265
He's lying!

936
01:27:52,308 --> 01:27:53,184
Yeon-hui,

937
01:27:53,977 --> 01:27:56,062
he's the devil.

938
01:27:57,313 --> 01:27:59,065
Don't side with the devil.

939
01:28:05,405 --> 01:28:07,198
Kwon Yang-rae, I'm a police officer.

940
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:09,742
Where is Shin A-yeong?

941
01:28:13,746 --> 01:28:18,459
Take me to a hospital first.

942
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,087
Just hurry up
and tell me where A-yeong is.

943
01:28:29,262 --> 01:28:31,264
I know you'll kill me after I tell you.

944
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:35,351
No, I won't. I won't kill you, so…

945
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:39,355
Just tell me where A-yeong is!

946
01:28:40,106 --> 01:28:41,774
You insane bitch.

947
01:28:42,483 --> 01:28:45,236
You expect me to believe you
when you're glaring at me like that?

948
01:28:45,903 --> 01:28:46,904
Fuck.

949
01:28:47,864 --> 01:28:51,034
There are so many lunatics
in this neighborhood. Do you know that?

950
01:28:53,244 --> 01:28:54,329
Tell me, you scumbag.

951
01:28:54,412 --> 01:28:56,247
Where is A-yeong?!

952
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:58,041
Tell me right now!

953
01:29:27,528 --> 01:29:29,697
Pastor! What are you doing?

954
01:29:29,781 --> 01:29:31,657
You think everything's a coincidence?

955
01:29:32,742 --> 01:29:34,494
There are no coincidences.

956
01:29:36,871 --> 01:29:38,748
He led us here.

957
01:29:39,874 --> 01:29:41,584
Snap out of it.

958
01:29:41,667 --> 01:29:44,629
Untie me, now!

959
01:29:47,715 --> 01:29:49,467
You see, God's will isn't something

960
01:29:49,967 --> 01:29:53,721
we mere humans can understand.

961
01:29:55,264 --> 01:29:58,142
I had a bit of a dilemma earlier.

962
01:29:59,894 --> 01:30:03,272
"What am I going to do with the body
once I kill that evil bastard?"

963
01:30:04,732 --> 01:30:06,401
"Should I just burn it?"

964
01:30:06,484 --> 01:30:10,405
"Or should I chop it into pieces
and dump it somewhere?"

965
01:30:12,907 --> 01:30:16,244
But God sent you to me, Detective.

966
01:30:19,122 --> 01:30:21,958
A-yeong! Do you know where A-yeong is?

967
01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:28,923
A-yeong is dead.

968
01:30:30,133 --> 01:30:31,509
She's lying somewhere dead.

969
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:34,971
So let's forget about A-yeong now.

970
01:30:35,471 --> 01:30:39,058
It's time to follow God's will
and punish this bastard

971
01:30:39,142 --> 01:30:40,852
for what he did to A-yeong.

972
01:30:42,395 --> 01:30:45,064
Pastor, please turn yourself in.
It's not too late.

973
01:30:46,524 --> 01:30:51,487
He shot and killed you
while grappling with you,

974
01:30:52,321 --> 01:30:54,282
and he fell to his death.

975
01:30:55,366 --> 01:30:56,909
Snap out of it, please.

976
01:30:56,993 --> 01:30:59,454
If you kill him, we'll never find A-yeong!

977
01:31:01,330 --> 01:31:03,958
Didn't you hear me? I told you she's dead.

978
01:31:04,041 --> 01:31:05,793
That devil killed her.

979
01:31:13,634 --> 01:31:16,220
That's right. It's you.

980
01:31:16,971 --> 01:31:18,764
You're Yeon-ju's sister, aren't you?

981
01:31:21,726 --> 01:31:25,146
I wondered why you were following me
and giving me that stare.

982
01:31:28,191 --> 01:31:29,484
But let's be honest.

983
01:31:30,401 --> 01:31:31,986
Did I kill her?

984
01:31:32,069 --> 01:31:33,154
-What?
-Did I?

985
01:31:34,113 --> 01:31:37,450
She jumped to her death on her own.

986
01:31:37,533 --> 01:31:39,619
-Am I wrong?
-What did you say?

987
01:31:40,578 --> 01:31:43,789
If everyone killed themselves
over a few days of suffering,

988
01:31:43,873 --> 01:31:45,875
I would've died 10,000 times by now.

989
01:31:45,958 --> 01:31:47,585
Do you know that? Fuck!

990
01:31:50,213 --> 01:31:54,717
Every night, that one-eyed monster came,

991
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:57,470
tied me up, and hit me--

992
01:31:57,553 --> 01:32:00,765
Shut up, devil!
Don't you dare flick your forked tongue.

993
01:32:00,848 --> 01:32:03,643
Stop! We have to find A-yeong.

994
01:32:03,726 --> 01:32:06,562
I told you she's dead. She is dead!

995
01:32:06,646 --> 01:32:10,107
Otherwise, I would've never received
the revelation to kill him!

996
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:14,570
God is perfect! He never makes mistakes!

997
01:32:14,654 --> 01:32:18,074
Please do something
about that crazy pastor.

998
01:32:18,157 --> 01:32:20,535
Don't you want to save A-yeong?

999
01:32:20,618 --> 01:32:22,245
Shut up, you bastard.

1000
01:32:22,328 --> 01:32:25,206
-You're lying to get out of here alive.
-He says she isn't dead.

1001
01:32:25,289 --> 01:32:26,874
I won't fall for your lies!

1002
01:32:26,958 --> 01:32:28,459
He says A-yeong is alive.

1003
01:32:29,293 --> 01:32:32,255
He says A-yeong is alive,
that she isn't dead!

1004
01:32:32,338 --> 01:32:34,840
Why would you let the devil deceive you?

1005
01:32:34,924 --> 01:32:36,634
Can't you tell that he's lying?

1006
01:32:37,718 --> 01:32:41,722
If we don't kill him now,
there will be more victims like A-yeong.

1007
01:32:41,806 --> 01:32:48,354
Glory to Jesus

1008
01:32:48,437 --> 01:32:53,276
Who died on the cross for our sins

1009
01:32:53,818 --> 01:32:58,030
The cross he carried…

1010
01:32:58,114 --> 01:32:59,115
Look at that.

1011
01:33:00,449 --> 01:33:01,742
He's clearly insane.

1012
01:33:03,869 --> 01:33:05,413
He's a child of Satan.

1013
01:33:06,914 --> 01:33:08,249
He is the devil.

1014
01:33:10,334 --> 01:33:14,505
Because of people like you
who side with the likes of him,

1015
01:33:15,423 --> 01:33:17,967
the world is becoming more evil.

1016
01:33:18,843 --> 01:33:24,599
All I take my pride in

1017
01:33:26,809 --> 01:33:31,147
Is His cross…

1018
01:35:17,253 --> 01:35:18,254
The girl…

1019
01:35:20,965 --> 01:35:22,883
The one-eyed monster ate her.

1020
01:35:23,759 --> 01:35:25,386
The one-eyed monster.

1021
01:36:02,339 --> 01:36:03,716
-Inspector Lee!
-Medics!

1022
01:36:04,925 --> 01:36:05,760
Hey, you two!

1023
01:36:10,139 --> 01:36:12,725
Tell me!

1024
01:36:12,808 --> 01:36:14,894
You can die after you tell me!

1025
01:36:19,857 --> 01:36:22,860
His heart isn't beating.
We'll transport him now.

1026
01:36:24,153 --> 01:36:26,655
Hey, I told you to go inside and check!

1027
01:37:07,947 --> 01:37:11,116
He says he received God's revelation
to kill Kwon Yang-rae.

1028
01:37:11,659 --> 01:37:15,037
I don't think he has any idea
where Shin A-yeong might be.

1029
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:17,748
Damn it, that crazy bastard.

1030
01:37:18,541 --> 01:37:20,793
Sir, I think his car
was found near Foxhill Pass

1031
01:37:20,876 --> 01:37:23,879
because he was headed to
Redevelopment Zone Four in Myeongbuk-dong.

1032
01:37:23,963 --> 01:37:27,508
Kwon had been working there
for three months and knew the area well.

1033
01:37:27,591 --> 01:37:30,427
I bet he took her there
if he needed a place to confine her.

1034
01:37:30,511 --> 01:37:33,180
How much time do you need
to comb through that area?

1035
01:37:33,264 --> 01:37:34,723
I'd say at least three days.

1036
01:37:34,807 --> 01:37:37,017
Three days? Then it'll be day five.

1037
01:37:37,101 --> 01:37:40,104
The chances of her being alive
after five days may be low.

1038
01:37:43,023 --> 01:37:47,444
The Lord's great grace has taught me

1039
01:37:47,528 --> 01:37:51,740
I feel the Lord's boundless grace

1040
01:37:59,874 --> 01:38:04,503
The Lord's boundless grace

1041
01:38:05,671 --> 01:38:12,052
When I follow the Lord

1042
01:38:12,136 --> 01:38:14,513
He gives me…

1043
01:38:18,851 --> 01:38:19,810
Hey!

1044
01:38:19,894 --> 01:38:21,729
What are you waiting for? Get moving.

1045
01:38:21,812 --> 01:38:22,855
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

1046
01:38:25,774 --> 01:38:28,986
Inspector Lee, don't worry.
Just go home and get some sleep.

1047
01:38:29,069 --> 01:38:30,738
I'll call you if we find her.

1048
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:06,857
Hey.

1049
01:39:09,151 --> 01:39:10,235
Mr. Kwon.

1050
01:39:11,528 --> 01:39:13,906
Hey, Mr. Kwon! Hey!

1051
01:39:13,989 --> 01:39:14,990
Yes?

1052
01:39:15,074 --> 01:39:18,953
We have to demolish everything here
by the end of the day, okay?

1053
01:39:19,036 --> 01:39:20,871
-Okay, got it.
-All right.

1054
01:39:56,448 --> 01:39:57,825
Oh, come in.

1055
01:40:03,956 --> 01:40:05,666
I was surprised to get your call.

1056
01:40:08,836 --> 01:40:09,920
DAD
IMAGE

1057
01:40:10,004 --> 01:40:11,380
SCAFFOLDING CAME DOWN

1058
01:40:12,548 --> 01:40:16,593
So, about that pastor,
I reviewed everything you sent.

1059
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:19,304
I think it's a classic case of apophenia.

1060
01:40:20,389 --> 01:40:21,473
"Apophenia"?

1061
01:40:21,557 --> 01:40:24,018
It refers to the tendency
to perceive meaningful rules,

1062
01:40:24,101 --> 01:40:26,937
patterns, or connections
between unrelated things.

1063
01:40:28,647 --> 01:40:32,234
What you're seeing now
is called pareidolia.

1064
01:40:32,985 --> 01:40:36,739
They're natural phenomena, but some people
believe they see specific images.

1065
01:40:37,489 --> 01:40:42,161
Those people attach profound meaning
to everything that happens by chance.

1066
01:40:50,586 --> 01:40:51,712
Dr. Lee.

1067
01:40:53,255 --> 01:40:54,089
I'm here

1068
01:40:55,174 --> 01:40:59,928
because I want to know
what kind of person Kwon Yang-rae is.

1069
01:41:13,650 --> 01:41:14,651
Horrible, isn't it?

1070
01:41:15,986 --> 01:41:18,238
He was abused almost every single day.

1071
01:41:18,822 --> 01:41:23,911
Every time it happened, his mother
sang hymns outside his room and prayed.

1072
01:41:27,081 --> 01:41:30,417
He talked about a one-eyed monster
before he died.

1073
01:41:31,668 --> 01:41:34,088
What do you think
this one-eyed monster could mean?

1074
01:41:34,171 --> 01:41:36,465
It may symbolize his stepfather
who abused him,

1075
01:41:37,758 --> 01:41:39,510
or Kwon himself.

1076
01:41:40,219 --> 01:41:42,638
Do you see the people in its mouth?

1077
01:41:43,347 --> 01:41:46,600
I'm not sure if it means
he's in the monster's head,

1078
01:41:47,267 --> 01:41:50,646
or he became the monster himself
and swallowed the victims.

1079
01:41:50,729 --> 01:41:52,147
It's all speculation.

1080
01:41:52,231 --> 01:41:54,274
It's like a puzzle,
but one thing's for sure.

1081
01:41:54,858 --> 01:41:59,446
That monster is deeply connected
to his traumatic memories from childhood.

1082
01:43:02,634 --> 01:43:04,052
Do you see things?

1083
01:43:10,684 --> 01:43:11,727
My sister…

1084
01:43:14,354 --> 01:43:15,397
I see her sometimes.

1085
01:43:17,691 --> 01:43:21,528
And what happens when you see her?
What does she say?

1086
01:43:24,656 --> 01:43:26,950
She says she waited for me to rescue her.

1087
01:43:28,368 --> 01:43:32,956
But the one coming through the door
was always him.

1088
01:43:36,043 --> 01:43:37,544
You know it's not your sister.

1089
01:43:39,171 --> 01:43:40,339
That's not Ms. Lee Yeon-ju.

1090
01:43:41,423 --> 01:43:45,928
It's just an illusion
created by your guilt.

1091
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:50,766
I know.

1092
01:43:52,893 --> 01:43:54,311
I know it's all an illusion.

1093
01:43:55,979 --> 01:43:57,856
But I just can't shake it off.

1094
01:44:04,154 --> 01:44:07,157
Even now, as we speak,
A-yeong must be waiting to be rescued.

1095
01:44:09,117 --> 01:44:13,121
She must be waiting to see someone
walk through the door and save her.

1096
01:44:16,124 --> 01:44:18,502
But again, there's nothing I can do.

1097
01:44:20,712 --> 01:44:22,714
What if we fail to find A-yeong?

1098
01:44:23,423 --> 01:44:25,467
If something bad already happened to her…

1099
01:44:27,511 --> 01:44:28,804
it's all on me.

1100
01:44:30,472 --> 01:44:31,807
It's all my fault.

1101
01:44:35,352 --> 01:44:36,603
This is all my fault!

1102
01:44:40,399 --> 01:44:41,400
All right.

1103
01:44:43,110 --> 01:44:44,653
You think it's all your fault.

1104
01:44:46,655 --> 01:44:49,700
Kwon blamed his crimes on the monster,

1105
01:44:50,409 --> 01:44:52,703
while Sung says it was God's revelation.

1106
01:44:52,786 --> 01:44:55,914
And you think it's all your fault.

1107
01:44:56,748 --> 01:44:59,209
It may all sound different,
but it's actually not.

1108
01:44:59,918 --> 01:45:03,005
You're all fixated on one thing
and think it caused the situation.

1109
01:45:04,965 --> 01:45:06,925
You see, most tragedies in life

1110
01:45:08,218 --> 01:45:11,305
are caused by a combination
of circumstances we can't control.

1111
01:45:11,388 --> 01:45:13,432
Things like the devil and monsters

1112
01:45:14,391 --> 01:45:17,019
are created by humans
to justify themselves.

1113
01:45:24,651 --> 01:45:26,194
Then what should I do now

1114
01:45:28,155 --> 01:45:29,364
to find A-yeong?

1115
01:45:30,741 --> 01:45:34,161
Let's just focus on the things
that we can actually see.

1116
01:45:35,620 --> 01:45:39,333
Kwon was getting better,
so what triggered him?

1117
01:45:40,208 --> 01:45:42,794
We must find out
what awakened his monster.

1118
01:45:42,878 --> 01:45:45,756
I'm sure there's something we missed.

1119
01:45:50,385 --> 01:45:53,430
Sir, the dean would like to meet with you.

1120
01:45:54,348 --> 01:45:56,099
You can go through the documents.

1121
01:46:13,825 --> 01:46:17,662
To your right! A little bit more!

1122
01:46:19,081 --> 01:46:20,290
Stop!

1123
01:46:42,521 --> 01:46:45,732
I would've died 10,000 times by now.
Do you know that? Fuck!

1124
01:46:47,484 --> 01:46:48,777
When I was young,

1125
01:46:49,736 --> 01:46:53,115
every night, that one-eyed monster came,

1126
01:46:53,198 --> 01:46:55,492
tied me up and hit me--

1127
01:47:05,627 --> 01:47:07,504
DAD

1128
01:47:14,678 --> 01:47:15,720
Hi, Dad.

1129
01:47:15,804 --> 01:47:19,099
What's going on?
You're not responding to my texts

1130
01:47:19,766 --> 01:47:21,810
and didn't come home last night.

1131
01:47:21,893 --> 01:47:24,688
I know. I've been busy.

1132
01:47:24,771 --> 01:47:26,231
There's a new case.

1133
01:47:27,649 --> 01:47:28,650
Anyway, what's up?

1134
01:47:28,733 --> 01:47:30,527
Didn't you see the picture I sent?

1135
01:47:30,610 --> 01:47:32,821
The scaffolding came down.

1136
01:47:33,321 --> 01:47:34,990
You wanted to see it.

1137
01:47:35,657 --> 01:47:36,658
Oh, right.

1138
01:47:37,534 --> 01:47:38,535
Hold on.

1139
01:47:38,618 --> 01:47:43,623
Well, the exterior is done, but we'll need
another month to complete the interior.

1140
01:47:43,707 --> 01:47:47,502
There are lots of big remodeling jobs
in this area.

1141
01:47:47,586 --> 01:47:50,297
They want to completely fix up old houses.

1142
01:47:50,380 --> 01:47:51,756
-Wait, Dad. But--
-My goodness.

1143
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:56,428
This one was stressful because the client
wanted to accentuate the one-eyed thing.

1144
01:47:57,512 --> 01:47:58,847
"One-eyed"?

1145
01:47:58,930 --> 01:48:02,225
That's right.
See the round window right under the roof?

1146
01:48:02,726 --> 01:48:07,397
It's called an oculus.
Some also call it a one-eyed window.

1147
01:48:07,939 --> 01:48:10,567
Gosh. Back in the day,
they built many houses like that.

1148
01:48:11,276 --> 01:48:13,653
But you rarely see them these days.

1149
01:48:18,033 --> 01:48:19,326
Are you listening?

1150
01:48:19,409 --> 01:48:21,578
What is wrong with this phone?

1151
01:48:25,540 --> 01:48:26,541
Ta-da!

1152
01:48:27,417 --> 01:48:29,961
Pretty, right? Come here, Yeon-hui.

1153
01:48:30,045 --> 01:48:31,421
Let's take a selfie together.

1154
01:48:32,923 --> 01:48:34,466
One, two, three.

1155
01:48:40,347 --> 01:48:44,392
Kwon was getting better,
so what triggered him?

1156
01:48:45,852 --> 01:48:48,396
We must find out
what awakened his monster.

1157
01:48:51,608 --> 01:48:53,109
Kwon Yang-rae's trigger.

1158
01:48:56,905 --> 01:48:57,906
Yes, Inspector Lee.

1159
01:48:57,989 --> 01:49:00,575
-I sent you a photo. Did you see it?
-A photo?

1160
01:49:00,659 --> 01:49:03,995
The "one-eyed monster" Kwon talked about
was a house with a circular window.

1161
01:49:04,079 --> 01:49:06,581
Check the street view
of Redevelopment Zone Four

1162
01:49:06,665 --> 01:49:09,251
and find a house with a window like that.

1163
01:49:09,334 --> 01:49:11,294
-That's where A-yeong is.
-Okay, got it.

1164
01:49:18,176 --> 01:49:21,555
Find a building with a circular window
like this in Zone Four. ASAP.

1165
01:49:21,638 --> 01:49:23,932
-Got it.
-Hey, share the photo quickly.

1166
01:49:55,797 --> 01:49:56,840
This is it.

1167
01:49:59,551 --> 01:50:01,970
DETECTIVE SO EUN-GYU:
23-7 MINDEULRE-GIL

1168
01:51:02,447 --> 01:51:03,948
Who the hell are you?

1169
01:51:27,931 --> 01:51:30,183
Wait, hang on.

1170
01:51:30,266 --> 01:51:31,810
Hang in there.

1171
01:51:39,401 --> 01:51:40,902
I kept telling myself

1172
01:51:41,736 --> 01:51:45,740
that someone would
walk through that door and rescue me.

1173
01:51:50,578 --> 01:51:54,249
It's all right.
You're safe. You're okay now.

1174
01:51:57,544 --> 01:51:58,586
You're okay now…

1175
01:52:53,641 --> 01:52:54,809
Mr. Sung Min-chan.

1176
01:52:56,352 --> 01:52:59,397
We found A-yeong.

1177
01:53:02,233 --> 01:53:05,278
You found her body?

1178
01:53:07,697 --> 01:53:08,698
No.

1179
01:53:09,991 --> 01:53:11,284
She's alive.

1180
01:53:12,494 --> 01:53:14,496
She's being treated in the hospital now.

1181
01:53:15,789 --> 01:53:18,750
She's still traumatized by what happened,

1182
01:53:18,833 --> 01:53:20,043
but her doctor says

1183
01:53:21,836 --> 01:53:23,588
that she's recovering quickly.

1184
01:53:30,678 --> 01:53:31,888
That's impossible.

1185
01:53:35,475 --> 01:53:37,310
I swear, I was told she died.

1186
01:53:39,020 --> 01:53:40,021
Who said that?

1187
01:53:42,524 --> 01:53:43,525
Pardon me?

1188
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:49,322
Who told you that she died?

1189
01:59:59,066 --> 02:00:01,694
