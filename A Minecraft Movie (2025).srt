00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,818
[man on TV] One thing's for sure…

185
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,403
[grunts] Yeah!

186
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,446
-[people cheering]
-…this kid had it all.

187
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,657
-Yeah!
-Time to take out the trash.

188
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:34,700
Yeah!

189
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,077
Mmm… Boo-rah!

190
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,162
[bell chimes]

191
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,123
Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison?

192
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:42,540
No autographs.

193
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:45,460
Have a nice day.

194
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:47,963
-[door opens]
-[bell chimes]

195
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,339
[groans]

196
00:09:58,348 --> 00:09:59,641
[sighs]

197
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:06,106
["When I'm Gone" playing]

198
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:14,031
[song ends]

199
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:17,075
Whoo! Yeah! Super cool!

200
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,035
[door shuts]

201
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,203
Garrett "The Garbage Man."

202
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,039
To what do we owe this pleasure?

203
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:22,873
Pleasure?

204
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,167
Think I come to storage auctions for fun?

205
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:27,461
I'm a businessman, Daryl.

206
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:28,378
An investor.

207
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:31,423
Well, I'm about to shovel
some coal into your choo-choo train.

208
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,633
You're gonna love this next unit.

209
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,844
It's got a waterbed.

210
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:37,763
It's got some pickaxes.

211
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:41,641
It's got a huge can of mixed nuts.

212
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:45,854
It's got an array
of unisex turquoise blouses.

213
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:47,230
That sounds terrible.

214
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:50,692
I think it's also got a 1978 Atari Cosmos.

215
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:54,029
Whoa, whoa, whoa. 1978 Atari Cosmos?

216
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:55,364
That's what it says here.

217
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:57,115
Those things are worth a frickin' fortune.

218
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:58,367
Heck yeah they are.

219
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,827
Bro, if you make this happen for me,

220
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:03,497
I will strongly consider
hanging out with you.

221
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,999
-You serious, bro?
-Yep.

222
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,837
Two big buffaloes like us
out there, in the wild,

223
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:14,132
wearing unisex turquoise blouses.

224
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,718
Oh, boy, that's gonna cause a commotion.

225
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:18,387
The ladies aren't gonna know what--

226
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,806
Listen, if you could keep
the hammer price under a hundy,

227
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:23,141
I'll make all your weird
fanboy dreams come true.

228
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:24,309
Okay?

229
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,814
Two loose cannons,
wearing turquoise blouses.

230
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,024
Yeah. Let's do it.

231
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,693
[Daryl] And we got 500 dollars,
500 dollars over here.

232
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:35,862
We got 500 dollars.
We got six, do we have six?

233
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:38,031
Do we have 600 dollars?
We got 600 dollars over here.

234
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:40,784
I'll go over here, 700 dollars,
we got 700 dollars.

235
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,702
We got 700 dollars here.
We got 800 dollars over here.

236
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:44,496
-[sighs]
-We got 850. Do we hear 850?

237
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,081
Do we-- 850 over here.

238
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,999
Do we hear any more?
Do we hear 900? 900?

239
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,252
Nine hundred, going once,
900 going twice.

240
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:51,753
And 900 going three times.

241
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:54,381
And sold to hometown hero,

242
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:57,551
Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison,
for 900 dollars.

243
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:02,556
[Garrett] I wouldn't cash that
for about six months.

244
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,432
What?

245
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:07,060
[whoops] Come to papa! Cosmos!

246
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:08,478
Whoo! [blows]

247
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:18,864
[orb chiming softly]

248
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:20,449
[Garrett] Daryl? Where is it?

249
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:22,284
I'm sorry. I didn't check the box.

250
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,287
-Whoa, whoa, whoa…
-[Garrett] Where's the Atari?

251
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,122
-Whoa!
-There's no Atari in here!

252
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,791
That does not mean
you can trash this unit!

253
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:30,834
[Garret grunts loudly]

254
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,794
I'm up against it, man, I'm--

255
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:34,588
[panting]

256
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:37,215
Oh, no. My store.

257
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:39,843
My wrists aren't
what they used to be. I just…

258
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,387
[panting]

259
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:44,347
I need a win, man. I need…

260
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,433
I need a win.

261
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:48,059
When are you gonna stop
looking for treasure

262
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:49,811
inside a storage unit…

263
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,565
and recognize that the real treasure…

264
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,067
…is inside your heart?

265
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:58,862
[sighs deeply]

266
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,489
[Daryl] Let's roll, everyone.

267
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:03,450
This man has no respect
for the storage community.

268
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:07,454
Daryl.

269
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:11,625
["I Remember You" by Skid Row playing]

270
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,834
Oh, man.

271
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:16,630
[chiming softly]

272
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,803
[shouting along with music]

273
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:25,597
[radiator pops]

274
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:30,185
Oh, no!

275
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,021
Oh, man!

276
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,482
What the frick?

277
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:40,111
[screaming]

278
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:46,785
Look, Chuglass
was not my first choice either,

279
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:49,329
but it was Mom's dying wish
for us to live here.

280
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:51,873
Or at least that's how I interpreted it.

281
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:54,125
Yeah, I read something online.

282
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:55,794
This place sucks.

283
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:57,879
Anyways, rent is super low,

284
00:13:57,963 --> 00:13:59,172
and I've got a full-time gig here,

285
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:01,967
so it's not really an offer
we can turn down right now.

286
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:03,802
[boy] Yeah, I get it.

287
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:06,263
Look, I think you're really
gonna like it here.

288
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:09,641
What's going on with that dude?

289
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,977
[screaming and sobbing]

290
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:18,108
[girl] Oh my gosh, Henry,
we're in Chuglass.

291
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,985
Say hi to Chuggy the Chip.

292
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:28,868
[girl] All right.
This is the new neighborhood.

293
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:30,328
[Henry] When was this house built?

294
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:33,665
[laughing] It's so nice to meet you.

295
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:34,874
Yeah, nice to meet you.

296
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,752
Uh, your new bosses sent you this.

297
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:38,628
Oh…

298
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,715
Yeah, people love working
at the potato chip factory.

299
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,300
Yeah, well, I'm, uh,

300
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,884
I'm running their socials
for a little bit.

301
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:47,178
I said I'd get
their follower count past 75.

302
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:49,431
Nice! You must be Henry.

303
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:51,224
Nice to meet you. I'm Dawn.

304
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:53,852
Hi. Why is there an alpaca
hanging out of your car?

305
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:54,853
[animals bleat]

306
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:57,147
[Dawn]
Well, real estate's not my only hustle.

307
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,608
I also do some mobile zoo stuff
on the side.

308
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,484
Anyhoo, I gotta run.

309
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,278
Call me if you need anything.

310
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:08,074
Also… I'm really sorry about your mom.

311
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:10,160
It's really brave what you're doing.

312
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,494
I hope you know that.

313
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,080
Thank you.

314
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:18,877
-[alpaca braying loudly]
-Chill out, man. I'm coming.

315
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,587
Golly!

316
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:27,844
[sighs]

317
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:55,580
[Natalie] Henry, breakfast is ready.

318
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:58,040
[Henry] I'm coming.

319
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:01,419
Check it out.

320
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:05,882
I made you Mom's signature
Tater Tot breakfast pizza.

321
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,510
So you can hand out slices
on your first day.

322
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,679
I thought you wanted me to seem normal.

323
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:11,680
I do.

324
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:13,306
I'm just trying to help you out.

325
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,600
I got you some body spray.

326
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:17,852
Signature scents are huge here.

327
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:19,604
[Henry] Velvet Mischief?

328
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:21,398
You're gonna want to spray it
and then walk into it.

329
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,483
Don't be too direct. It's really powerful.

330
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,610
-Okay.
-Love you.

331
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:27,487
Love you, too. [sniffs]

332
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:30,281
Smells like banana bread and poo.

333
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:43,837
[bell chimes]

334
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,098
[exhales]

335
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:02,272
[orb chiming softly]

336
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:03,982
[Henry] Your store's really cool.

337
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:05,483
Yeah, I know.

338
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,484
Looking for anything in particular?

339
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,445
Nah, just checking some stuff out.

340
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,948
Non-committal. Classic loser mentality.

341
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:12,866
I can help.

342
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:16,035
I'm starting a mentorship program

343
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,621
for people who want to win
at the game of life.

344
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,832
-Fifty bucks an hour.
-Cool.

345
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,584
How do you actually win at life?

346
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,753
[scoffs] That's literally the answer
I charge money for.

347
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:29,924
Tots. What's with the breakfast pizza?

348
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:30,884
My sister made it.

349
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:33,344
I'm supposed to hand out slices
at school to make friends.

350
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:35,054
A little desperate for day one,
don't you think?

351
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:38,308
I also notice that
you're wearing Velvet Mischief.

352
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,351
It's a wonderful cologne.

353
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:41,895
And I strongly believe
that every young man

354
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,229
should have his own signature scent.

355
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:44,481
[sniffs]

356
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,357
I didn't think I applied very much.

357
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:48,818
Listen, I'm gonna give you
a hot Garbage tip.

358
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,029
Friendship is like a puzzle.

359
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:52,947
Sometimes you think
you need lots of pieces to be cool.

360
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,408
And sometimes
it's just one piece to be cool.

361
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:56,910
And people will be like,

362
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,120
"That's not a puzzle, that's a picture."

363
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,081
And they have a right to speak, too.

364
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:03,875
Any questions?

365
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,210
Yeah. Quite a few, actually.

366
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:08,505
Listen, kid.
The point is, there's no "I" in team.

367
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,423
But there are two in winning.

368
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,967
Okay, well, I gotta go to school.

369
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:14,761
Whatever, nerd. Just leave the pizza.

[woman] All right.
Let's put this nametag on.

372
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,813
Uh, why does it have an exclamation point?

373
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:28,483
[chuckles] Oh, Henry,
we're just so thrilled to have you.

374
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:31,110
You know,
you're the first student to enroll here,

375
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:34,322
ever since that article came out
about the school rankings.

376
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,408
Anyway,
I'm Vice Principal Marlene,

377
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:39,160
and I'm an open book.

378
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:41,120
You probably heard
that my husband, Clemente,

379
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:42,956
recently divorced me.

380
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:46,793
And to be honest,
I expected it to hurt more than it does.

381
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:51,089
You know, the fire went out
on our marriage 20 years ago,

382
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:53,633
but we stuck it out for the dogs.

383
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,929
Okay, let's get you to your first class.

385
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:00,974
[teacher] Good morning.

386
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,851
Just a little something about myself.

387
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:05,562
I teach gym, I teach art.

388
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:09,816
Financially,
I'm living in a nightmare, okay?

389
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:12,902
I wouldn't wish my life on my worst enemy.

390
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:15,697
Last year, I claimed
4,000 dollars on my tax return.

391
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:19,450
So in the summer, I do clams
and oysters down by the airport.

392
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:22,704
But most of my money is tied up
in a drone kiosk at the mall.

393
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:26,249
Okay, today we're gonna do a still life.

394
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,502
One orange, one banana.

395
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,004

Don't you know what a still life is?

399
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,607

That jetpack would never work.

403
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:57,864
It's kind of foolproof, actually.
It's just math.

404
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,366
My dad said math has been debunked.

00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:20,997
I think this is Wyoming.

[Garrett] Oooh.

544
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:37,638
If that's what I think it is,

545
00:26:37,722 --> 00:26:39,390
it could be our first quest giver.

546
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:40,766
[retches]

547
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,184

Hmm.

Come closer. It's all right.

567

[whimpering fearfully]

569
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:34,195
Oh! How pretty.

570
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:37,281
But how will that help me find more gold?

572
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:39,992

Was I unclear when I said

585
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:16,404
no one was to waste time
on art or leisure?

Dennis?

590
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:31,710
You stole it from me,
and now you will retrieve it.

591
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:35,005
It would be a privilege, my liege.

592

We're going to unbind you now.

Go ahead. Strike me down.

My piglins will make a meal
of your beautiful wolf.

599
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,275
How do I know you're telling the truth?

600
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:56,735
There's only one way to find out.

601

We humbly seek gold.

612
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,856
Give us a quest that will lead us
to your treasure load.

at the Woodland Mansion,

You don't bug them, they won't bug you.

829

They just like to chill, trade,
and eat buttloads of bread.

They love crushing loaf.

831

Your old dungeon buddy, Steve,
has betrayed us.

Well, that's a bummer.

907

The Orb is with four Roundlings.

Look, your brother has a gift.
You know that, right?

You should let him explore it.

is it on the way to this Mansion place?

00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:33,784
Malgosha's path to darkness

1257
00:57:33,868 --> 00:57:35,703
started the way these things often do…

1258
00:57:36,245 --> 00:57:40,040
during the semi-finals of
The Nether's Got Talent.

1259
00:57:40,124 --> 00:57:41,917
[dance music playing]

1260
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:47,965
Young Malgosha always dreamed
of being a world-class dancer.

1261
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:49,508
[Malgosha grunting]

1262
00:57:49,592 --> 00:57:52,052
Her moves were pretty out there.

1263
00:57:52,136 --> 00:57:54,430
No one in the Nether was ready for it.

1264
00:57:54,513 --> 00:57:57,933
[all guffawing]

1265
00:57:58,017 --> 00:57:59,643
[Steve] It crushed her.

1266
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:03,731
What'd I tell you about all that dancing?

1267
00:58:03,814 --> 00:58:05,608
It's time for you to grow up.

1268
00:58:05,691 --> 00:58:08,360
I'm tired of you chasing your dreams.

1269
00:58:08,444 --> 00:58:11,405
Now, take this axe and go find some gold.

1270
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:14,116
That was such embarrassing dancing!

1271
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,618
[Steve] So, from that day forward,

1272
00:58:15,701 --> 00:58:18,454
she denounced all forms of creativity.

1273
00:58:19,288 --> 00:58:23,167
If she ever gets that Orb,
she'll black out the sun.

1274
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,002
Nether wart will flourish.

1275
00:58:25,085 --> 00:58:26,545
This beautiful world and everything in it

1276
00:58:26,629 --> 00:58:27,755
will wither and die.

1277
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:29,423
And you were gonna give it to her?

1278
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:30,507
Great idea!

1279
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:32,468
I'm not gonna give it to her.

1280
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:34,720
But I need that Orb for leverage.

1281
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:36,805
I gotta save Dennis.

1282
00:58:36,889 --> 00:58:37,973
Come.

1283
00:58:38,057 --> 00:58:40,142
[animals lowing and bleating]

1284
00:58:40,226 --> 00:58:43,312
The Woodland Mansion
is just beyond the Redstone Mountains.

1285
00:58:43,771 --> 00:58:46,065
We can go over or through.

1286
00:58:46,732 --> 00:58:47,858
Whatever's fastest.

1287
00:58:49,818 --> 00:58:51,362
Through will be faster.

1288
00:58:52,404 --> 00:58:54,740
[piglins grunting, snorting]

1289
00:58:58,244 --> 00:58:59,662
General Chungus,

1290
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:02,498
you have failed me for the last time.

1291
00:59:02,581 --> 00:59:04,333
Yeah, I'm really sorry about that.

1292
00:59:04,416 --> 00:59:07,211
[growls] Bring out the beast!

1293
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:09,630
-[piglin grunting]
-What?

1294
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:11,966
What do you mean you just
have to put the brain in?

1295
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:14,468
Well, yes, it's a big deal.
Get it done!

1296
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:17,554
Look, everybody knows
it wasn't my best day.

1297
00:59:17,638 --> 00:59:19,890
But I'm really trying
to set some new goals, and--

1298

[roaring]

1301
00:59:30,651 --> 00:59:32,695
The Great Hog.

1302
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:34,613
My ultimate weapon.

1303
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:40,286
There he is!

1304
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:44,248
Kill him!

1305
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:47,501
Wait, does this mean you're firing me?

1306
00:59:48,127 --> 00:59:50,296
-[sizzling]
-[Malgosha laughs]

1307
00:59:50,379 --> 00:59:51,880
Well done.

1308
00:59:51,964 --> 00:59:55,551
Now, find the Roundlings
and bring me the Orb!

1309
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:57,261
[guttural howl]

1310

[wolf howls]

1311
00:59:59,555 --> 01:00:01,348
[Natalie] We are so lost.

1312
01:00:01,432 --> 01:00:03,392
[grunts loudly]

1313

-[grunts]
-[groaning]

1314
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:11,483
My one job was to protect Henry,
and I blew it.

1315
01:00:11,567 --> 01:00:12,901
[zombie moans]

1316
01:00:12,985 --> 01:00:16,405
I just promised my mom
I'd never let anything happen to him.

1317
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:19,575
I guess I'm just not cut out
for this parenting stuff.

1318
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:25,622
[sighing] I just wish
I could have been a kid

1319
01:00:25,706 --> 01:00:27,583
for a little bit longer, you know?

1320
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:30,377
Just to have that feeling like
I could have done anything.

1321
01:00:30,461 --> 01:00:31,420
I hear you.

1322
01:00:31,503 --> 01:00:33,756
Being a grown-up sucks.
[grunts]

1323
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:35,924
You got all these responsibilities,

1324
01:00:36,008 --> 01:00:37,801
and you just stop chasing your dreams.

1325
01:00:37,885 --> 01:00:40,262
[both grunting]

1326
01:00:40,346 --> 01:00:42,639
You think I like having 15 hustles?

1327
01:00:42,723 --> 01:00:45,517
[wolf growling]

1328
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:48,479
[Dawn gasps]

[Natalie yells]

1331
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:54,234
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold up, hold up.

1332
01:00:55,152 --> 01:00:56,612
Let's just calm down.

1333
01:00:57,738 --> 01:01:00,199
I think this one just needs some TLC.

1334
01:01:01,533 --> 01:01:03,827
Yeah? You like bones?

1335
01:01:04,536 --> 01:01:08,624
Oh, I bet you like bones.
Yes, you do. Yes, you do.

1336
01:01:08,707 --> 01:01:11,794
[gasps, laughs]

1337
01:01:11,877 --> 01:01:14,171
Aren't you a beautiful one?

1338
01:01:14,254 --> 01:01:16,799
-Yes you are! Yes you are!
-[panting]

1339
01:01:17,925 --> 01:01:19,843
I cannot believe you just did that.

1340
01:01:20,761 --> 01:01:21,887
[Dawn] Wait.

1341

[Dennis whining]

-Steve's Dennis?

1344
01:01:27,893 --> 01:01:29,603
Well, can you take us to him?

-[Dawn, laughs] Oh!

01:01:33,649 --> 01:01:36,527

our way to the Woodland Mansion.

[Dawn shrieks]

1349
01:01:38,529 --> 01:01:40,114
Let's follow that pooch!

1350
01:01:42,741 --> 01:01:45,577
Son of a biscuit, we found it.

Looky, looky here.

1353
01:01:49,498 --> 01:01:51,792
Welcome to the Redstone Mines.

1354
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:55,879
You see that glowy stuff?
That's redstone.

1355
01:01:56,171 --> 01:01:57,756
Conducts energy.

1356
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:59,925
You can build some
crazy contraptions with it.

1357
01:02:01,927 --> 01:02:04,054
I thought you said
this was a diamond mine.

1358
01:02:04,138 --> 01:02:07,975
Easy, big dog.
They're here, but be careful.

1359
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:10,644
I set some booby traps a long time ago.

1360
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:13,397
But I can't for the life of me
remember where they are--

Get them off me!

1365
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:26,994
Help me, please!

1366
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:29,329
-Sorry!
-[screaming]

1367
01:02:33,292 --> 01:02:36,128
Hah! Here it is! Thanks, Garrett.

1368

Yes!

1372
01:02:44,011 --> 01:02:46,054
[Garrett] Ooh!
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1373

Steve delivers the goodies!

1374
01:02:48,223 --> 01:02:49,808
Did you guys plan this?

1375
01:02:50,476 --> 01:02:51,894
I'm sorry, Henry.

1376
01:02:52,227 --> 01:02:53,395
[Garrett] Whoo!

1377
01:02:53,479 --> 01:02:55,606
Yeah! I'm not.

1378
01:02:56,190 --> 01:02:58,066
Oh, yeah.

1379
01:02:58,150 --> 01:02:59,943
-What the heck, man?
-Oh, relax.

1380
01:03:00,027 --> 01:03:01,612
Natalie could be at the Mansion already.

1381
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:03,030
She could be in danger!

[gagging]

1383
01:03:05,574 --> 01:03:07,784
Oh, no. Do you smell that?

1384
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:09,828
Nether wart.

1385
01:03:10,579 --> 01:03:11,455
What does that mean?

1386
01:03:11,538 --> 01:03:13,457
[heavy thudding]

01:03:17,377 --> 01:03:20,130
No! The Great Hog!

1389
01:03:20,214 --> 01:03:22,049
She finally put the brain in.

1390
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:23,383
Run for the minecarts!

[all yelling]

1396
01:03:36,897 --> 01:03:40,442
If memory serves, I built a kick-ass
safe room just up ahead.

1397
01:03:43,237 --> 01:03:44,821
[Steve] Whoo!

1398
01:03:44,905 --> 01:03:46,949
Dang it, my torch blew out.

1399
01:03:47,032 --> 01:03:47,991
[Henry] Why are we stopping?

1400
01:03:48,075 --> 01:03:49,910
[Steve] 'Cause we ran out of redstone!

1401
01:03:49,993 --> 01:03:51,995
We're gonna need a boost fast.

-[sparking, hissing]
-[Garrett] What's that sound?

1403
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:56,833
[Steve] Chill out, Gar-Gar.
We're totally safe.

1404
01:03:59,002 --> 01:04:01,630
Crap! My creeper farm.

1405
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:05,175
[Garrett] What the--?
You gotta be kidding me!

1406
01:04:05,634 --> 01:04:07,678

would breed these things?

-Up ahead, look!
-[Garrett squeaks]

1410
01:04:15,477 --> 01:04:17,479
[Steve] We gotta get
to the redstone rail!

1411
01:04:17,563 --> 01:04:18,939
[Henry] Garrett,
you got us into this mess!

1412
01:04:19,022 --> 01:04:20,107
Get out and push!

1413
01:04:21,108 --> 01:04:23,527
Okay. Okay.

1414

[growling]

1415
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:29,783
Go, Garrett! Go faster!

1416
01:04:30,784 --> 01:04:32,536
We're not gonna make it!

1417
01:04:32,619 --> 01:04:33,287
Come on!

1418
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:34,788
Come on, Garrett, you gotta go faster!

1419
01:04:35,122 --> 01:04:36,665
Start slapping, Hank!

1420
01:04:36,748 --> 01:04:38,375
Get outta here! Yeah! Get--

[Garrett] Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

1427
01:05:15,871 --> 01:05:17,122
[Steve] Nice work, Gar-Gar.

1428
01:05:17,205 --> 01:05:19,207
Your little detour almost got us killed.

1429
01:05:19,291 --> 01:05:22,002
Relaje, you're so dramatic.
We're still alive.

1430
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:23,295
What's your problem, man?

1431
01:05:23,587 --> 01:05:25,380
We didn't need those stupid diamonds.

1432
01:05:25,464 --> 01:05:26,673
I swear, you are literally the most

1433
01:05:26,757 --> 01:05:28,300
selfish person I've ever met.

1434
01:05:28,383 --> 01:05:31,136
Whatever. I need them, okay?

1435
01:05:31,219 --> 01:05:32,220
I need the diamonds,

1436
01:05:32,304 --> 01:05:34,348
because I need the money,
because I'm broke.

1437
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:37,309
You wouldn't know anything about that.

1438
01:05:39,144 --> 01:05:42,648
My life sucks, kid. All right?
I'm a frickin' loser.

1439
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:44,650
There, I said it.

1440
01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:47,319
I know it looks like I got it
all put together, right?

1441
01:05:47,402 --> 01:05:50,030
I'm smart, funny, bilingual.

El humble to un el faultot.

1443
01:05:57,746 --> 01:05:59,206
But that's not the reality.

1444
01:06:00,415 --> 01:06:01,625
I'm not doing well.

1445
01:06:02,751 --> 01:06:05,462
I'm washed up, Hank,
and I'm gonna lose everything.

1446
01:06:06,505 --> 01:06:08,256
And that's not the worst part.

1447
01:06:09,758 --> 01:06:10,967
I'm alone.

1448
01:06:11,885 --> 01:06:12,803
You weren't alone.

1449
01:06:13,929 --> 01:06:15,222
I was your friend.

1450
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:21,812
Sorry about your finances.

1451
01:06:22,562 --> 01:06:23,939
Shut up, Steve.

1452
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:28,652
[Marlene] Wow.

1453
01:06:29,111 --> 01:06:31,697
I feel like you get me,
and you're an incredible listener.

1454
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:35,784
And only people with emotional
intelligence are good listeners.

1455
01:06:37,202 --> 01:06:39,454
You know, I just didn't think
it was in the cards

1456
01:06:39,538 --> 01:06:42,040
that I would have another
first date, ever, you know?

1457
01:06:42,582 --> 01:06:43,375
Hm.

1458
01:06:44,292 --> 01:06:45,919
I wanna have the guts to invite you

1459
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:47,713
over to my house for dessert.

1460
01:06:48,046 --> 01:06:49,756
Huh. Uh-huh.

1461
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:51,550
Are you finished?

1462
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,552
No, I think he's Swedish.

1463
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,595
But we're done with our meal.

1464
01:06:57,514 --> 01:07:00,475
There it is. The Woodland Mansion.

1465
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:02,561
We're gonna get in there,
get the Earth Crystal

1466
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:04,312
and get you guys home.

1467
01:07:04,396 --> 01:07:05,564
Follow me!

1468
01:07:06,148 --> 01:07:07,232
Check this out.

1469
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:09,109
Let's do this.

1470
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:11,361
Pay close attention to Papa Steve.

1471
01:07:11,445 --> 01:07:13,613
The Woodland Mansion has three floors.

1472
01:07:14,114 --> 01:07:17,242
The first floor
is loaded with Vindicators.

1473
01:07:17,659 --> 01:07:18,952
Axe murderers, basically.

1474
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:20,537
Why is the third floor
on the first floor?

1475
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:22,038
I'm very confused.

1476
01:07:22,122 --> 01:07:23,540
[Steve] I was trying
to make three floors,

1477
01:07:23,623 --> 01:07:25,584
but I didn't have time to make,
like, a doll house.

1478
01:07:25,876 --> 01:07:29,171
The second floor crawls with Evokers.

1479
01:07:29,254 --> 01:07:31,256
They wield powerful dark magic.

1480
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:33,091
This is the worst model I've ever seen.

1481
01:07:33,175 --> 01:07:34,176
Garrett, stop talking.

1482
01:07:34,259 --> 01:07:35,510
We're trying to figure out a plan.

1483
01:07:35,594 --> 01:07:37,012
Bro, how long are you
gonna be mad at me for?

1484
01:07:37,095 --> 01:07:38,180
I just got mad at you.

1485
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:39,973
Please don't be mad at me for this, okay?

1486
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:42,434
But I accidentally stole the Orb
while you were crafting.

1487
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:45,687
Are we cool now?

1488
01:07:45,771 --> 01:07:48,648
You are literally the worst person
in the entire world.

1489
01:07:48,732 --> 01:07:52,277
Guys! Both of you,
eyes on my demonstraysh!

1490
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:55,155
Third floor houses the Loot Chamber.

1491
01:07:55,655 --> 01:07:57,199
That's where the Earth Crystal is,

1492
01:07:57,282 --> 01:07:59,534
but it's guarded by Endermen.

1493
01:07:59,618 --> 01:08:02,245
Whatever you do,
do not look them in the eye.

1494
01:08:02,329 --> 01:08:03,789
They'll fry your brains out.

1495
01:08:03,872 --> 01:08:05,874
Okay well, I could build stairs
to the second floor,

1496
01:08:05,957 --> 01:08:08,084
sneak in through the window,
and snag the Earth Crystal.

1497
01:08:08,168 --> 01:08:09,461
That's a great idea, Hank.

1498
01:08:09,544 --> 01:08:12,839
But to pull it off, we're gonna
need a pretty sweet diversion.

1499
01:08:13,381 --> 01:08:15,383
You know what could work on these guys?

1500
01:08:15,467 --> 01:08:16,384

01:13:59,853 --> 01:14:02,313
[Malgosha] I knew
I'd find you dummies here.

1609
01:14:02,397 --> 01:14:03,982
Oh no. It's her!

1610
01:14:04,065 --> 01:14:06,151
[Malgosha] Of course it's me, you fool.

1611
01:14:06,234 --> 01:14:09,612
I've been tracking your scent
from two biomes away.

1612
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:13,366
Check it out.
I even built me a new Hog.

1613
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:15,577
[roaring]

1614
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:18,955
Malgosha! Your reign is over!

1615
01:14:19,038 --> 01:14:20,456
You're wrong.

1616
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:22,208
It's just beginning.

1617
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:24,169
-[grunts]
-[gasps]

1618
01:14:25,879 --> 01:14:26,880
[Henry] No!

1619
01:14:27,714 --> 01:14:28,631
Hah!

1620
01:14:28,715 --> 01:14:29,757
No!

1621
01:14:29,841 --> 01:14:30,884
Kill them.

1622
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:32,844
We have work to do.

1623
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:35,555
Goodbye, Steve!

1624
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:37,056
[cackling]

1625
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:38,141
-[piglins screeching]
-[Garrett whimpers]

1626
01:14:41,769 --> 01:14:42,770
[Steve] No!

1627
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:45,273
They're gonna blow this bridge sky high!

1628
01:14:45,565 --> 01:14:47,275
-Sorry, Hank.
-What?

1629
01:14:48,276 --> 01:14:49,277
[Garrett yells]

1630
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,112
[screaming]

1631
01:14:53,198 --> 01:14:55,617
Yeah! Slime cube.

1632
01:14:57,952 --> 01:15:01,414
[grunts, hollers]

1633
01:15:05,168 --> 01:15:06,419
Come on, Garrett, jump!

1634
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:07,712
I can't, Steve.

1635
01:15:07,795 --> 01:15:08,963
Get him outta here!

1636
01:15:09,255 --> 01:15:11,507
Go, Hank!
Save your sister and get home!

1637
01:15:11,591 --> 01:15:13,301
Garrett, you don't have to do this!

1638
01:15:13,384 --> 01:15:14,844
Tell my story in song.

1639
01:15:15,261 --> 01:15:18,765
Keep it metal. Keep it heavy.
Real instruments.

1640
01:15:19,766 --> 01:15:20,892
Besides…

1641
01:15:23,436 --> 01:15:25,021
I love luaus.

1642
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:28,441
Spin kick.

1643
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:31,653
[roaring]

1644
01:15:31,736 --> 01:15:33,488
[high battle cry]

1645
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:37,158
Garbage toss! Oh, crap!

1646
01:15:37,617 --> 01:15:39,285
[Steve shouts]

1647
01:15:39,369 --> 01:15:42,121
[Henry] No!

1648
01:15:42,205 --> 01:15:44,207
[both yelling]

1649
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:47,293
We're going down!

1650
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:49,420
Brace for impact!

1651
01:15:49,504 --> 01:15:52,548
[both yelling]

1652
01:15:53,091 --> 01:15:54,926
[grunting]

1653
01:16:03,434 --> 01:16:05,895
[Steve chuckles]

1654
01:16:09,107 --> 01:16:10,441
-Dennis?
-[whines]

1655
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:13,027
-Dennis!
-[Dawn laughing]

1656
01:16:13,111 --> 01:16:15,071
It's you! It's really you!

1657
01:16:15,154 --> 01:16:17,573
[laughing]

1658
01:16:18,241 --> 01:16:19,242
Gimme…

1659
01:16:19,325 --> 01:16:21,536
[babbling affectionately]

1660
01:16:22,662 --> 01:16:24,038
Oh!

1661
01:16:24,122 --> 01:16:25,581
How'd you find me?

1662
01:16:25,665 --> 01:16:27,041
He's one heck of a wolf.

1663
01:16:27,125 --> 01:16:29,210
He led us right to you guys.

1664
01:16:29,294 --> 01:16:31,754
Now I understand why you kept
yourself so filthy and smelly,

1665
01:16:31,838 --> 01:16:33,381
so Dennis could find you one day.

1666
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:35,967
Is he okay?

1667
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:38,344
He's fine. He's just resting.

1668
01:16:38,428 --> 01:16:39,512
Good.

1669
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:41,347
It was a pretty rough crash landing.

1670
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:43,933
Wait a minute. Where are we?

1671
01:16:45,268 --> 01:16:47,437
-[Dawn laughing]
-Whoa!

1672
01:16:49,397 --> 01:16:52,275
I wish Garbage Man was here to see this.

1673
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:54,152
He would've loved your mushroom hut.

1674
01:16:54,235 --> 01:16:55,945
Yeah, I think so too.

1675
01:16:59,574 --> 01:17:02,285
[voice shaking]
I was so afraid that I lost you.

1676
01:17:04,454 --> 01:17:06,122
I was so afraid that I lost you, too.

1677
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:11,044
I am really sorry about what I said.

1678
01:17:12,587 --> 01:17:14,630
And I'm really sorry about Garrett.

1679
01:17:17,842 --> 01:17:19,344
[ghast shrieking]

1680
01:17:19,427 --> 01:17:22,013
[Malgosha] I'm only gonna say this once.

1681
01:17:22,096 --> 01:17:25,558
This thingy goes on top of that thingy.

1682
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:27,060
Got it, Travis?

1683
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:31,189
It's gonna make a real cool
laser beam that'll darken--

1684
01:17:31,272 --> 01:17:32,482
[shrieking]

1685
01:17:32,565 --> 01:17:34,817
[Malgosha, growls] Never mind.

1686
01:17:40,031 --> 01:17:43,159

[all grumbling, growling]

1690
01:17:59,634 --> 01:18:02,428
[Steve] No. No!

1691
01:18:03,554 --> 01:18:06,557
The Great Darkening! It's begun.

1692
01:18:06,641 --> 01:18:08,684
Malgosha's gathering all her forces.

1693
01:18:08,768 --> 01:18:10,770
She will destroy this land.

1694
01:18:11,479 --> 01:18:14,315
Unless… we go get that Orb.

1695
01:18:14,399 --> 01:18:16,359
Well, what're we doing here?

1696
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,404
Let's go fight some pigs.

1697
01:18:19,487 --> 01:18:21,906
I'm ready. I'm done with those pigs.

1698
01:18:21,989 --> 01:18:22,824
Yeah, me too.

1699
01:18:22,907 --> 01:18:25,034
Let's do it for Gar-Gar.

1700
01:18:25,118 --> 01:18:27,912
First we mine, then we craft.

1701
01:18:27,995 --> 01:18:29,497
Let's Minecraft!

1702
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:31,833
-[grunts] One, two, three.
-Team!

1703
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:33,501
-Get the Orb!
-Orb! What are you saying?

1704
01:18:33,584 --> 01:18:35,211
-Minecraft.
-We should all say that.

1705
01:18:35,294 --> 01:18:37,755
On three. One--
Forget it. There's no time!

1706
01:18:39,048 --> 01:18:40,508
[Steve] Show us what you got, Henry.

1707
01:18:40,591 --> 01:18:42,135
[Henry] Okay. I got a plan.

1708
01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:43,553
[Steve] Killer recipes.

1709
01:18:43,636 --> 01:18:44,846
We're gonna have to move fast.

1710
01:18:44,929 --> 01:18:46,097
Let's get to work!

1711
01:18:47,306 --> 01:18:49,559
[Henry] First we're gonna need
some iron ingots.

1712
01:18:49,642 --> 01:18:51,436
[sizzling]

1713
01:18:54,147 --> 01:18:55,940
[grunts] Oh, yeah!

1714
01:18:57,775 --> 01:18:59,235
[Henry] And the boots of Swiftness.

1715
01:19:01,446 --> 01:19:03,197
[Dawn] Time to light this place up.

1716

-[bones rattling]
-Come on, boys.

1717
01:19:07,326 --> 01:19:09,412
Have a nice flight!

Yeah, man! Whoo!

1719
01:19:14,167 --> 01:19:16,836
I bet you do. I bet you do!

1720
01:19:16,919 --> 01:19:18,629
[Henry] We're also gonna
need a ton of diamonds.

1721
01:19:18,713 --> 01:19:21,340
[grunting]

1722
01:19:23,468 --> 01:19:24,927
[Steve] Show me what you got, Nat.

1723
01:19:25,803 --> 01:19:27,597
Whoa! Yeah!

1724
01:19:28,598 --> 01:19:29,807
[Natalie] You want some, buddy?

1725
01:19:33,436 --> 01:19:34,937
[excited chatter]

1726
01:19:35,354 --> 01:19:36,189
We're ready.

1727
01:19:36,272 --> 01:19:38,274
Let's go save the Overworld!

All right, my piggies.

1731
01:19:48,826 --> 01:19:53,122
Today, we take the Overworld as ours!

[all roaring]

1733
01:19:54,624 --> 01:19:56,584
Attack their villages.

1734
01:19:56,667 --> 01:20:00,505
Burn their homes
and their symmetrical farms.

1735
01:20:01,088 --> 01:20:05,468
All they have created, we destroy!

1736

[all roaring]

1737
01:20:09,222 --> 01:20:11,641
Well, what are you
standing around for?

1738
01:20:11,724 --> 01:20:12,808
Get out of here!

1739
01:20:12,892 --> 01:20:15,394
Go on, bring me the gold!

Hah! News flash!

1746
01:21:05,945 --> 01:21:08,864

[Malgosha] Oh, for goodness' sake!

1757
01:21:57,622 --> 01:22:00,750
Well, what are you doing,
you big block of meat?

1758
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:03,294
Get down there and take care
of those Roundlings!

[gasps] Huh?

1767
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:39,038
Okay, Goshe. Let's dance.
