1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000

3
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,000
Yelena!

4
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:27,375
Yelena!

5
00:27:31,541 --> 00:27:33,250
Yelena, c'mon!

6
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,583
Lunch will be over soon.

7
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:44,458
Why'd you bring us so far out?

8
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:46,458
Anya, over here!

9
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:57,541
I'm sorry.

10
00:28:09,291 --> 00:28:13,666
Well done, Yelena.
Your first test is now complete.

11
01:05:33,458 --> 01:05:35,166
Stay quiet, Valentina.

12
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:37,916
Completely quiet, no matter what you hear.

13
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,333
You promise me?

14
01:05:39,416 --> 01:05:40,833
Did I do something wrong?

15
01:05:40,916 --> 01:05:43,666
The man in town asked where we live.

16
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:46,500
He said he was your friend, so I told him.

17
01:05:46,583 --> 01:05:48,041
Yes, well he was.

18
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:51,000
Remember I told you not to talk to anyone?

19
01:05:51,083 --> 01:05:53,291
Yes, daddy. I'm so sorry.

20
01:05:53,833 --> 01:05:56,583
It's okay. Just stay hidden for me.

21
01:06:03,375 --> 01:06:04,458
You know...

22
01:06:04,541 --> 01:06:06,708
I've been in this business a long time.

23
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:11,000
There's always someone like you,
smart, but cocky.

24
01:06:11,083 --> 01:06:13,416
A hungry dog who already had
a bone in his mouth.

25
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,500
Let's have a drink, shall we?

26
01:06:16,333 --> 01:06:18,750
You still think
you're getting away with this.

27
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:22,208
Don't worry,
I'll look out for your sweet Valentina.

28
01:35:15,583 --> 01:35:17,291
Yelena, c'mon!

29
01:35:21,041 --> 01:35:23,125
Lunch will be over soon.

30
01:35:24,125 --> 01:35:25,916
Why'd you bring us so far out?

31
01:35:30,958 --> 01:35:32,375
Anya, over here!

32
01:35:36,208 --> 01:35:37,333
I'm sorry.

33
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:15,125
It's too late for that, friend.
