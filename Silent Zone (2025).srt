1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000


2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000


3
00:00:27,288 --> 00:00:29,812
We're looking at a
very disturbing live shot here.

4
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:32,075
According to
police sources,

5
00:00:32,162 --> 00:00:35,383
we're dealing with
aggressive infected individuals

6
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,646
within the airport premises.

7
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:38,864
Even after
two months,

8
00:00:38,951 --> 00:00:40,649
the pandemic is unstoppable.

9
00:00:40,736 --> 00:00:43,608
Despite the efforts,
new cases appear nationwide.

10
00:00:43,695 --> 00:00:45,654
Symptoms can
show sometimes within days

11
00:00:45,741 --> 00:00:46,959
or even minutes.

12
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,614
People become
uncontrollable raging beasts.

13
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:52,748
And they're
very, very dangerous.

14
00:00:52,835 --> 00:00:55,098
Today, the
World Health Organization

15
00:00:55,185 --> 00:00:58,928
officially announced that
this is a global pandemic.

16
00:01:00,712 --> 00:01:02,018
We're all going to die!

17
00:01:03,324 --> 00:01:04,455
These people are ill.

18
00:01:04,542 --> 00:01:05,674
They have rights.

19
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:07,154
And how dare
you call them "ferals"?

20
00:01:07,241 --> 00:01:08,068
I say one thing.

21
00:01:08,155 --> 00:01:09,591
Fake news.

22
00:01:09,678 --> 00:01:11,897
The airport
quarantine has been breached.

23
00:01:11,984 --> 00:01:14,422
Authorities are asking
everyone to stay at home.

24
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:16,250
Do not go out at this point.

25
00:01:16,337 --> 00:01:17,599
This is real.

26
00:01:17,686 --> 00:01:18,817
This is happening now.

27
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,733
Gun them down, one by one.

28
00:01:25,172 --> 00:01:27,043
We've seen
police fleeing the scene

29
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,264
and National Guard
soldiers are falling back.

30
00:01:30,351 --> 00:01:32,788
Curfew has been
ordered with immediate effect.

31
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:34,572
Do not try to escape.

32
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:36,183
Stay where you are and hide.

33
00:01:42,276 --> 00:01:43,190
Duck shot.

34
00:01:43,277 --> 00:01:44,234
So tough.

35
00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:45,148
Ooh.

36
00:01:48,325 --> 00:01:51,241
Hmm.

37
00:01:52,721 --> 00:01:54,679
Getting a little thin on top.

38
00:01:54,766 --> 00:01:56,768
How about a little
soap to stimulate the scalp?

39
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:08,563
Mom?

40
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,260
The y don't
bel ieve that the authorities

41
00:02:10,347 --> 00:02:13,176
are capable of
controlling the situation.

42
00:02:13,263 --> 00:02:16,701
Shops are closed,
public services unavailable,

43
00:02:16,788 --> 00:02:17,920
and panic reigns...

44
00:02:21,358 --> 00:02:22,794
- in
so ciety

45
00:02:22,881 --> 00:02:25,188
and now you want to matter
for your own unlawfully...

46
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:27,408
We can't just
shoot them, they're people.

47
00:02:27,495 --> 00:02:29,279
People
protecting their fellow citizens

48
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:31,412
while you are preaching
about civil rights in both

49
00:02:31,499 --> 00:02:32,891
Mom?

50
00:02:32,978 --> 00:02:34,197
People, they're
not even humans.

51
00:02:34,284 --> 00:02:35,981
Are you out of
your goddamn mind?

52
00:02:36,068 --> 00:02:38,245
That is not
true and you know it.

53
00:02:38,332 --> 00:02:40,421
We're watching
the death of the country

54
00:02:40,508 --> 00:02:43,119
and the only thing that matters
to you is all this crap.

55
00:02:47,515 --> 00:02:49,038
Gotcha.

56
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:49,995
Ha ha.

57
00:02:51,258 --> 00:02:52,955
I can't leave without
you.

58
00:02:53,042 --> 00:02:54,522
I know you're
strong enough darling.

59
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:56,045
I can't do this alone.

60
00:02:57,481 --> 00:02:58,656
Let me talk to the kids.

61
00:02:59,962 --> 00:03:01,398
Kids, come here.

62
00:03:01,485 --> 00:03:02,573
Your dad wants to talk to you.

63
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,360
Hey, pumpkin.

64
00:03:06,447 --> 00:03:08,710
When are you
coming home, Daddy?

65
00:03:08,797 --> 00:03:10,146
I don't know, pumpkin.

66
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:11,365
You got to
help your mom

67
00:03:11,452 --> 00:03:14,150
and get yourselves
over to Aunt Carrie's.

68
00:03:14,237 --> 00:03:16,239
But I don't like Aunt
Carrie's.

69
00:03:16,326 --> 00:03:17,806
I know.

70
00:03:17,893 --> 00:03:20,591
I'll pick you up as soon
as I get out of here. Alright?

71
00:03:20,678 --> 00:03:21,462
OK.

72
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:22,941
Don't you worry.

73
00:03:23,028 --> 00:03:24,987
You see, I'm
wearing my lucky bracelet

74
00:03:25,074 --> 00:03:27,555
and I can feel
its magic right now.

75
00:03:28,425 --> 00:03:31,472
I promise, everything's
going to be just fine.

76
00:03:31,559 --> 00:03:32,734
Bye.

77
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,315
Give me your bag.

78
00:03:54,451 --> 00:03:55,409
Get this on.

79
00:03:55,496 --> 00:03:56,497
Go, go, go, go, go!

80
00:04:00,022 --> 00:04:00,805
Go, go, go!

81
00:04:00,892 --> 00:04:02,242
Stay close to me.

82
00:04:05,114 --> 00:04:06,637
Abby, Abby.

83
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,393
No!

84
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:41,455
Abby.

85
00:04:54,555 --> 00:04:56,078
Abby.

86
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,826
No.

87
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,286
All right.

88
00:05:31,287 --> 00:05:32,680
It's OK.

89
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,769
You're safe now.

90
00:05:34,856 --> 00:05:35,726
Come here.

91
00:05:36,553 --> 00:05:37,380
Yeah.

92
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:42,037
It's OK.

93
00:05:42,124 --> 00:05:42,994
OK.

94
00:05:43,647 --> 00:05:44,692
You're safe now.

95
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:45,649
OK?

96
00:05:50,872 --> 00:05:52,177
OK.

97
00:06:01,012 --> 00:06:02,449
Close your eyes.

98
00:06:02,536 --> 00:06:03,580
Go over your ears.

99
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:05,016
Good.

100
00:06:29,258 --> 00:06:30,128
OK.

101
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,610

Align the sights.

118
00:09:09,113 --> 00:09:10,550
Focus on the reticle.

119
00:09:12,682 --> 00:09:13,988
Breathe.

120
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,991
Place the pad of your finger--

121
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:24,781
Remember this, old man.

122
00:09:27,871 --> 00:09:28,872
Cocky.

123
00:10:17,486 --> 00:10:19,444
Abigail, let's go.

124
00:10:33,894 --> 00:10:34,721
Dinner time.

125
00:11:02,487 --> 00:11:03,358
Finished?

126
00:11:11,845 --> 00:11:12,976
One!

127
00:11:13,063 --> 00:11:13,890
Only, one!

128
00:11:22,638 --> 00:11:25,989
Well, we got 39 seeds that
are good for a tropical climate.

129
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:30,254
The rest we
can get in Garden City.

130
00:11:30,341 --> 00:11:32,082
I know a place there.

131
00:11:32,909 --> 00:11:35,477
It's hard to
picture us as farmers.

132
00:11:35,564 --> 00:11:38,132
I bet we'll miss the adventure.

133
00:11:38,219 --> 00:11:39,481
I'll miss them.

134
00:11:42,092 --> 00:11:42,919
Nothing more.

135
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,968
Oh, and by the way,

136
00:11:48,055 --> 00:11:52,407
I plan to spend most
of my time sitting on a beach

137
00:11:52,494 --> 00:11:53,756
sipping orange juice.

138
00:11:54,801 --> 00:11:56,585
I can't wait to see the ocean.

139
00:11:56,672 --> 00:11:58,326
Two weeks.

140
00:11:58,413 --> 00:11:59,980
You can cross it
off your bucket list.

141
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:20,930
A scout?

142
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:22,453
Yeah.

143
00:13:23,411 --> 00:13:25,152
So the pack
must be nearby.

144
00:13:26,022 --> 00:13:27,154
At least 30 ferals.

145
00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:30,679
Get your gear.

146
00:13:30,766 --> 00:13:31,680
We're moving.

147
00:13:50,003 --> 00:13:51,265
Wakey, wakey.

148
00:13:51,352 --> 00:13:52,440
Come on.

149
00:13:52,527 --> 00:13:53,833
We're leaving.

150
00:14:56,417 --> 00:14:57,679
Screw you.

151
00:14:58,898 --> 00:14:59,768
We could...

152
00:15:00,682 --> 00:15:01,901
we could go up north.

153
00:15:02,423 --> 00:15:04,468
We could climb
up the old ferris wheel.

154
00:15:04,555 --> 00:15:06,035
Nah, it's too big a detour.

155
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,124
Okay. Um...

156
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:10,213
We could fly to the island.

157
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,562
I hate flying.

158
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:13,695
Look, just
stick to the plan, okay?

159
00:15:17,873 --> 00:15:19,440
But what if it wasn't a scout?

160
00:15:19,527 --> 00:15:21,572
Just a lonely feral.

161
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:23,052
There's no one here except--

162
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:24,749
Okay, okay, okay.

163
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:26,229
Okay.

164
00:15:54,736 --> 00:15:56,085
Ammo?

165
00:15:56,172 --> 00:15:59,349
31 left of the 9mil
and 40 of the 5.56s.

166
00:16:13,668 --> 00:16:14,799
I can get it.

167
00:16:15,844 --> 00:16:17,237
Don't rush this time.

168
00:16:17,324 --> 00:16:18,978
Wait for it.

169
00:16:21,893 --> 00:16:23,330
No, no, no, no, no.

170
00:16:29,814 --> 00:16:32,339
Fuck!
I told you not to rush.

171
00:16:56,798 --> 00:16:58,930
It's the same pack.

172
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,932
We gotta be close.

173
00:17:02,412 --> 00:17:04,197
Abigail, search the car.

174
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,114
Abigail, let's go.

175
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:23,172
Here.

176
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:24,086
Here.

177
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,396
I'm sorry, pal.

178
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:31,311
We can't waste any bullets.

179
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:44,063
Nice boots.

180
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:47,066
May I have 'em?

181
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,421
Ahh!

182
00:18:17,748 --> 00:18:21,100
Trevor, where
are you, mate? Over.

183
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,103
Pack what's useful.
Let's go.

184
00:18:27,889 --> 00:18:28,803
If we're fast enough,

185
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,457
we can make it to the ridge.

186
00:18:30,544 --> 00:18:32,023
And the pack might not see us.

187
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,155
But they'll see them.

188
00:18:33,242 --> 00:18:34,287
None of our business.

189
00:18:34,374 --> 00:18:35,505
We gotta warn them.

190
00:18:35,592 --> 00:18:37,203
Where are you,
man? Hey?

191
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,682
Hey, don't answer.

192
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,032
Think a little.

193
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,775
What'll be their first
question when they get here?

194
00:18:44,862 --> 00:18:46,864
They'll ask, when
are the others coming?

195
00:18:56,047 --> 00:18:57,223
Abigail!

196
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,398
Hey!

197
00:18:58,485 --> 00:18:59,529
Abigail!

198
00:18:59,616 --> 00:19:01,140
Hello!

199
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:19,810
What the hell happened here?

200
00:19:19,897 --> 00:19:21,421
Your friends
have been attacked.

201
00:19:21,508 --> 00:19:23,727
Drop your weapons
and get your hands up.

202
00:19:24,337 --> 00:19:25,425
I said drop
your weapons

203
00:19:25,512 --> 00:19:27,209
and get your fucking hands up.

204
00:19:27,296 --> 00:19:29,472
All right, man.
Take it fucking easy, okay.

205
00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:34,303
Check it.

206
00:19:42,093 --> 00:19:43,399
It's okay.
We don't want to hurt you.

207
00:19:43,486 --> 00:19:44,574
Shut up!

208
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,885
I've got a bad
feeling about this.

209
00:19:50,972 --> 00:19:52,060
She's just a kid.

210
00:19:53,148 --> 00:19:54,932
I don't like
the look of the big guy.

211
00:20:09,382 --> 00:20:11,558
Yeah, you know who
we hate the most?

212
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:12,776
Looters.

213
00:20:13,386 --> 00:20:14,561
We're gonna do
the same thing to you

214
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:16,563
that we do to
everyone of you scumbags.

215
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,001
We're gonna rip
you off, break your legs,

216
00:20:20,088 --> 00:20:22,308
and leave you
here to fucking rot.

217
00:20:22,395 --> 00:20:23,352
You misunderstand.

218
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:25,224
Oh, we do, you little bitch.

219
00:20:27,313 --> 00:20:28,923
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

220
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,620
Don't do it. Put it down.

221
00:20:30,707 --> 00:20:31,578
Put it down.

222
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:32,666
Don't do this.

223
00:20:32,753 --> 00:20:33,623
Take it easy, man.

224
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,537
Put him down.

225
00:20:34,624 --> 00:20:35,495
Take it easy.

226
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:42,153
Put your guns down.

227
00:20:44,982 --> 00:20:46,984
We don't mean to hurt you.

228
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:49,944
Megan, get back in the car!

229
00:20:50,553 --> 00:20:52,294
Look, we just
wanted to warn you.

230
00:20:52,381 --> 00:20:53,469
Warn us about what?

231
00:20:53,556 --> 00:20:55,428
The ferals.
We got to get out of here.

232
00:21:15,448 --> 00:21:17,188
Back to the cars.
Let go.

233
00:22:54,677 --> 00:22:55,896
Fuck!

234
00:22:57,114 --> 00:22:58,289
Fuck!

235
00:24:09,012 --> 00:24:10,666
Ammo.

236
00:24:10,753 --> 00:24:14,104
Uh, 16 of the 9mil
and 37 of 5.56's.

237
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:17,281
Dammit, we
lost nearly everything.

238
00:24:17,368 --> 00:24:18,761
What the
hell were you thinking,

239
00:24:18,848 --> 00:24:20,154
traveling in that condition?

240
00:24:20,241 --> 00:24:22,678
We ran out of
everything so we had to leave.

241
00:24:22,765 --> 00:24:24,463
But where to?

242
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:27,814
Northeast, to a colony
on a riverside, a boat town.

243
00:24:27,901 --> 00:24:29,511
How far along are you?

244
00:24:29,598 --> 00:24:31,687
It's the 35th week.

245
00:24:32,427 --> 00:24:33,472
What does that mean?

246
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:34,951
It means she's close.

247
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:42,263
What about you?

248
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,133
Where you going?

249
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,700
Definitely not Northeast.

250
00:24:44,787 --> 00:24:45,658
Why not?

251
00:24:46,267 --> 00:24:47,398
We've been
to several colonies

252
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,922
and we've seen
the same everywhere.

253
00:24:49,009 --> 00:24:49,879
Same what?

254
00:24:49,966 --> 00:24:51,664
Same chaos.

255
00:24:55,624 --> 00:24:56,625
Dammit!

256
00:24:58,279 --> 00:24:59,628
Pop the hood.

257
00:25:09,812 --> 00:25:11,901
Maybe I can fix it.

258
00:25:11,988 --> 00:25:13,424
Radiator's shot.

259
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,643
We have no spare parts.

260
00:25:15,731 --> 00:25:17,646
The fuck are
you, the geek squad?

261
00:25:18,212 --> 00:25:19,300
Yeah.

262
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:21,694
I'm David, by the way.

263
00:25:22,651 --> 00:25:23,522
Abigail.

264
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:27,090
And the
grumpy guy is Cassius.

265
00:25:27,177 --> 00:25:28,744
This is Megan.

266
00:25:28,831 --> 00:25:29,702
Hi.

267
00:25:31,747 --> 00:25:34,315
So, now what?

268
00:25:34,402 --> 00:25:35,621
Get your stuff.

269
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:36,578
We're leaving.

270
00:25:49,983 --> 00:25:51,593
Just leave it, not worth it.

271
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,203
We should contact the colony.

272
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,640
Let them know
that we're coming.

273
00:26:33,461 --> 00:26:34,984
Looks fine.

274
00:26:36,507 --> 00:26:37,944
Okay, five minutes.

275
00:27:15,459 --> 00:27:17,505
We need to find
a shelter for the night.

276
00:27:17,592 --> 00:27:19,550
A less exposed building.

277
00:27:21,422 --> 00:27:23,337
She won't hold out for long.

278
00:27:31,214 --> 00:27:32,563
That's the old elementary
school.

279
00:27:33,956 --> 00:27:35,697
And the Jackson house is there.

280
00:27:36,263 --> 00:27:37,786
That'll do
for the night.

281
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,050
Let's hit camp.

282
00:29:45,435 --> 00:29:47,046
You sure you don't want any?

283
00:29:47,133 --> 00:29:50,005
Thanks, but we
only eat meat that we hunted

284
00:29:50,527 --> 00:29:52,529
because of the infection.

285
00:29:58,231 --> 00:30:02,496
Um, we'd like to
thank you for helping us.

286
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:03,671
Can't imagine what would
have happened

287
00:30:03,758 --> 00:30:05,542
if you hadn't come.

288
00:30:06,935 --> 00:30:08,067
I can.

289
00:30:16,989 --> 00:30:18,904
Tell me about
the place you lived.

290
00:30:18,991 --> 00:30:19,861
What was it like?

291
00:30:19,948 --> 00:30:21,515
It was just an ordinary farm.

292
00:30:21,602 --> 00:30:23,386
Far from everything.

293
00:30:23,473 --> 00:30:26,346
There were times when
it was 40 of us, but then...

294
00:30:29,131 --> 00:30:31,220
But then
the Grim Reaper came.

295
00:30:33,353 --> 00:30:34,310
And the colony?

296
00:30:34,397 --> 00:30:35,616
What do you know about it?

297
00:30:35,703 --> 00:30:37,270
We talked
to them on the radio

298
00:30:37,357 --> 00:30:39,533
and they have
plenty of water and food

299
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,709
and they even have doctors.

300
00:30:41,796 --> 00:30:43,711
They pulled a
couple of shipwrecks together.

301
00:30:43,798 --> 00:30:45,974
Now over 100
people live on the water.

302
00:30:46,061 --> 00:30:47,193
How far is it?

303
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,021
It's about a week's travel.

304
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,545
It's risky.

305
00:30:51,632 --> 00:30:55,201
But we voted and
the majority decided to go.

306
00:30:55,288 --> 00:30:56,898
Because we couldn't stay.

307
00:31:00,728 --> 00:31:02,164
You know, the
ferals killed so many.

308
00:31:02,251 --> 00:31:05,515
After the last
attack, we had to burn down

309
00:31:05,602 --> 00:31:07,561
a whole wheat
field just to stop them.

310
00:31:07,648 --> 00:31:10,085
We had almost nothing left.

311
00:31:10,172 --> 00:31:12,871
The boat town
is the only safe place.

312
00:31:14,263 --> 00:31:15,090
And you?

313
00:31:16,178 --> 00:31:17,571
How did you survive?

314
00:31:17,658 --> 00:31:18,572
Because we never
stopped.

315
00:31:20,052 --> 00:31:21,880
And Cassius
taught me everything.

316
00:31:22,576 --> 00:31:25,231
To hunt, to survive,

317
00:31:25,318 --> 00:31:27,407
and even the most important
thing.

318
00:31:27,494 --> 00:31:28,538
We're better off alone.

319
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:31,672
You can only count on yourself.

320
00:31:32,281 --> 00:31:35,023
Tell me this is not your plan.

321
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,765
To just wander
around until the end of time.

322
00:31:37,852 --> 00:31:40,724
No, we are
headed to the west coast.

323
00:31:40,811 --> 00:31:42,117
Then to the islands by boat.

324
00:31:56,044 --> 00:31:58,438
Okay. So...

325
00:32:00,222 --> 00:32:02,355
This is where
your friends were killed.

326
00:32:02,442 --> 00:32:04,313
And this is where we are now.

327
00:32:05,097 --> 00:32:07,186
I wouldn't
recommend the old route 50.

328
00:32:07,273 --> 00:32:10,015
But if you had North here,

329
00:32:10,102 --> 00:32:11,581
you get out of the city.

330
00:32:11,668 --> 00:32:13,627
And the 55 here,

331
00:32:13,714 --> 00:32:15,803
takes you to the river.

332
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:17,239
Uhm...

333
00:32:17,326 --> 00:32:19,372
We thought we'd go together?

334
00:32:19,459 --> 00:32:20,808
That you'd come with us?

335
00:32:20,895 --> 00:32:22,027
Yeah.

336
00:32:22,114 --> 00:32:22,897
Nah.

337
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,551
That's not a good idea.

338
00:32:24,638 --> 00:32:26,422
Well, why not?

339
00:32:26,509 --> 00:32:27,771
Well...

340
00:32:29,121 --> 00:32:33,690
Because we're the
only survivors in the area.

341
00:32:33,777 --> 00:32:36,476
And when the pack finishes
the feast from your friends,

342
00:32:36,563 --> 00:32:40,219
which can happen any
minute now, they'll remember us.

343
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:44,571
So, I wanna be as far away
as possible when that happens.

344
00:32:44,658 --> 00:32:45,528
Got it?

345
00:32:45,615 --> 00:32:48,357
I thought we were far enough.

346
00:32:48,444 --> 00:32:50,881
Far enough?

347
00:32:54,276 --> 00:32:57,062
Far enough
don't exist, sweetheart.

348
00:32:57,888 --> 00:33:00,065
That's why we don't join.

349
00:33:00,935 --> 00:33:02,154
That's the trick.

350
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:05,984
I suggest you do the same.

351
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:11,380
I'm sorry, it's just...

352
00:33:31,096 --> 00:33:33,924
We have to
start the collection over.

353
00:33:34,273 --> 00:33:35,926
It'll take
months before we can leave.

354
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,972
Why don't we
check out the colony?

355
00:33:39,582 --> 00:33:40,409
We've seen enough.

356
00:33:41,541 --> 00:33:43,369
Why would
this be any different?

357
00:33:43,456 --> 00:33:45,414
We could use the company.

358
00:33:46,546 --> 00:33:47,764
Maybe these
people are different.

359
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,946
People are the
same everywhere, Abigail.

360
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:59,037
No matter
whether it's North, South,

361
00:33:59,124 --> 00:34:01,996
or some shitty boat town.

362
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:04,781
Still, we can't
just leave them alone.

363
00:34:04,868 --> 00:34:06,131
You said back in the old days,

364
00:34:06,218 --> 00:34:07,871
people would help each other.

365
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:09,569
You said that was a good thing.

366
00:34:09,656 --> 00:34:11,962
And still, the
world is full of the bodies

367
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,442
of selfless people.

368
00:34:16,271 --> 00:34:17,533
Whatever.

369
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:19,318
I'm giving them
my gun and some ammo

370
00:34:19,405 --> 00:34:20,493
so at least I can sleep well.

371
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,016
Sleep well?

372
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:23,539
How the fuck
are you gonna sleep well

373
00:34:23,626 --> 00:34:24,845
after the mess you made today?

374
00:34:25,976 --> 00:34:27,282
Did you even
consider the fact

375
00:34:27,369 --> 00:34:28,457
that we
nearly died at the mine?

376
00:34:28,544 --> 00:34:29,328
But we didn't!

377
00:34:29,415 --> 00:34:30,546
No thanks to you!

378
00:34:31,504 --> 00:34:33,941
Fuck, Abigail. Get off
your high horse!

379
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,250
You'll get us into trouble
again next time, just think.

380
00:34:39,729 --> 00:34:41,688
Fucking think before you act.

381
00:34:44,952 --> 00:34:47,128
Thanks for today's lesson.

382
00:34:47,215 --> 00:34:49,391
It was really useful.

383
00:34:49,478 --> 00:34:51,263
I'll be on watch.

384
00:36:07,469 --> 00:36:09,297
Blackbeard one, Blackbeard one.

385
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:12,126
This is Papa Hotel five, over.

386
00:36:16,652 --> 00:36:18,915
Blackbeard one, Blackbeard one.

387
00:36:19,002 --> 00:36:20,569
This is Papa Hotel five, over.

388
00:36:37,499 --> 00:36:38,761
Can't sleep, huh?

389
00:36:40,633 --> 00:36:41,503
Me neither.

390
00:36:46,378 --> 00:36:47,205
It's chilly.

391
00:36:53,776 --> 00:36:55,561
That was really amazing back in
the valley.

392
00:36:55,648 --> 00:36:57,563
I mean, those moves.

393
00:36:58,738 --> 00:37:01,001
Really amazing.

394
00:37:10,706 --> 00:37:11,577
It was luck.

395
00:37:18,932 --> 00:37:19,976
Sheer luck.

396
00:37:24,633 --> 00:37:28,637
Problem of luck is that
eventually you run out of it.

397
00:37:29,638 --> 00:37:32,032
I don't know what I would
do if there was no way out.

398
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:33,381
It's easy.

399
00:37:38,908 --> 00:37:40,301
It was a serious question.

400
00:37:40,388 --> 00:37:42,260
So was the answer.

401
00:37:42,782 --> 00:37:44,218
This,

402
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,395
this is my plan B.

403
00:37:49,005 --> 00:37:51,573
Even has my name on it.

404
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,835
Really?

405
00:37:53,836 --> 00:37:54,837
No.

406
00:37:55,751 --> 00:37:58,406
Still, it's mine.

407
00:37:58,493 --> 00:38:01,670
Well this is mine.

408
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,761
Hey, that's
not a bad plan either.

409
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,809
Hey man.

410
00:38:09,896 --> 00:38:10,766
Oh yeah, it's nothing.

411
00:38:10,853 --> 00:38:12,377
I just, I twisted my ankle.

412
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,597
And you know,
it's nothing compared

413
00:38:15,684 --> 00:38:17,120
to what she's going through.

414
00:38:18,383 --> 00:38:20,733
I know she blames
herself for what happened.

415
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,301
She was so
convinced we get to the colony.

416
00:38:24,214 --> 00:38:26,304
She convinced everyone else.

417
00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:30,264
I'm just glad
that today we survived.

418
00:38:39,621 --> 00:38:41,275
We'll help
you get to the colony.

419
00:40:13,498 --> 00:40:15,238
Time to move on.

420
00:40:15,325 --> 00:40:16,326
Come on.

421
00:40:58,934 --> 00:40:59,979
We must rest.

422
00:41:00,066 --> 00:41:01,807
Look, if we stop, we die.

423
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:06,551
I remember this place.

424
00:41:07,334 --> 00:41:08,509
We used to come
here a lot with my dad.

425
00:41:08,596 --> 00:41:09,902
Yeah?

426
00:41:09,989 --> 00:41:12,208
There's a civil
airport a couple of miles away.

427
00:41:12,295 --> 00:41:13,253
My dad had a small plane there.

428
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,907
We used to fly it all the time.

429
00:41:14,994 --> 00:41:16,996
Oh, you think that some
plane that's been lying around

430
00:41:17,083 --> 00:41:18,476
for years is gonna fly?

431
00:41:18,563 --> 00:41:20,608
There used to
be dozens of planes.

432
00:41:20,695 --> 00:41:21,870
Lots of spare parts.

433
00:41:23,263 --> 00:41:24,177
We could do it.

434
00:41:24,264 --> 00:41:26,396
We don't have time for this.

435
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,224
Still, we
can't just walk for days.

436
00:41:28,311 --> 00:41:30,226
Look, I know
a place in the town.

437
00:41:30,313 --> 00:41:31,837
If the tools are still there,

438
00:41:31,924 --> 00:41:33,795
we'll figure out
something.

439
00:41:33,882 --> 00:41:36,624
Old cars,
bikes, whatever, we'll see.

440
00:41:36,711 --> 00:41:38,800
At this pace, we
won't get there until sunset.

441
00:41:38,887 --> 00:41:40,628
The airport is
only about an hour's walk.

442
00:41:42,891 --> 00:41:43,849
All right.

443
00:41:45,415 --> 00:41:46,199
Let's give it a try.

444
00:41:46,286 --> 00:41:47,722
Give it a try?

445
00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:50,072
Look, there's
one road to the airport.

446
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:52,684
If we get
surrounded there, it's over.

447
00:41:52,771 --> 00:41:55,643
Then walking will be
the least of our problems.

448
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:57,515
Well, it's just your opinion.

449
00:41:59,908 --> 00:42:01,127
Let's have a vote.

450
00:42:01,214 --> 00:42:02,215
Who's for?

451
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,135
It's decided then.

452
00:42:10,876 --> 00:42:12,530
Come on, darling.

453
00:42:44,997 --> 00:42:46,346
They've been shot.

454
00:42:46,433 --> 00:42:47,695
Not long ago.

455
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:49,828
Check inside.

456
00:42:49,915 --> 00:42:51,090
We've got two minutes.

457
00:42:51,177 --> 00:42:52,178
Take only what's useful.

458
00:42:52,265 --> 00:42:53,483
We must eat something.

459
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:54,615
We haven't
stopped since this morning.

460
00:42:54,702 --> 00:42:56,269
We'll eat the airport.

461
00:42:56,356 --> 00:42:57,531
Why?

462
00:42:58,488 --> 00:42:59,664
Because we're not alone.

463
00:43:14,766 --> 00:43:16,115
Sorry.

464
00:43:33,001 --> 00:43:34,394
Ah, might not kill us.

465
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:37,527
Oh, coffee.

466
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:38,616
We have to try it.

467
00:43:51,498 --> 00:43:52,368
Bingo!

468
00:44:02,465 --> 00:44:04,642
Not much use
to them, so...

469
00:44:07,906 --> 00:44:08,733
Thanks.

470
00:44:16,479 --> 00:44:19,700
I'm sorry you
were arguing because of us.

471
00:44:19,787 --> 00:44:21,659
Oh, it wasn't because of you.

472
00:44:24,618 --> 00:44:26,664
Do you have a
name for the baby?

473
00:44:28,013 --> 00:44:28,883
Not yet.

474
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:33,061
But I'm not
afraid we won't find a name.

475
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,246
I fear that my child
will have to grow up alone.

476
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,513
Living in constant uncertainty.

477
00:44:53,865 --> 00:44:57,999
I just want someone to
be with her, to look after her.

478
00:45:03,396 --> 00:45:05,224
And I'd give my life for that.

479
00:45:31,685 --> 00:45:32,773
You see?

480
00:45:34,819 --> 00:45:35,689
Nothing.

481
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,655
That's unlucky.

482
00:45:46,613 --> 00:45:48,006
We should turn back?

483
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,357
No, no we shouldn't.

484
00:45:51,923 --> 00:45:53,968
That'd be a
fucking stupid idea.

485
00:45:54,055 --> 00:45:56,101
We have to find a path.

486
00:45:56,188 --> 00:45:57,319
Okay, asshole.

487
00:45:57,406 --> 00:45:59,147
Fuck you.

488
00:45:59,234 --> 00:46:00,670
That's enough.

489
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,977
David, relax.

490
00:46:03,891 --> 00:46:05,632
What the hell are you doing?

491
00:46:05,719 --> 00:46:10,593
Hey, that's where
my dad's hangar used to be.

492
00:46:23,215 --> 00:46:24,259
How do we open it?

493
00:47:01,253 --> 00:47:04,822
If we can fix it, we can
get there in a couple of hours.

494
00:47:06,171 --> 00:47:07,041
Uh-huh.

495
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:10,479
And where do
we land the plane?

496
00:47:11,045 --> 00:47:13,613
We'll cross that
bridge when we get there.

497
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:14,570
Uh-huh.

498
00:47:22,927 --> 00:47:23,928
Just in case.

499
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:25,712
Okay.

500
00:47:25,799 --> 00:47:27,192
We're gonna
look around. Ok?

501
00:47:28,367 --> 00:47:29,672
You gonna be all right?

502
00:47:29,759 --> 00:47:30,804
Yeah.

503
00:48:59,501 --> 00:49:03,897
What do you say to
Belle or Benedict if it's a boy?

504
00:49:03,984 --> 00:49:07,466
First of all,
it's definitely a boy.

505
00:49:07,553 --> 00:49:11,600
And secondly, Benedict.

506
00:49:12,471 --> 00:49:15,735
Sounds like some kind
of troubadour or something.

507
00:49:16,823 --> 00:49:19,043
All right. Fine.

508
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:23,569
How about Sandra and Samuel?

509
00:49:24,135 --> 00:49:25,005
Dammit.

510
00:49:25,832 --> 00:49:27,965
Easy, David,
you can do it, it's okay.

511
00:49:28,052 --> 00:49:29,705
I can't fucking--

512
00:49:33,883 --> 00:49:34,928
Let me see.

513
00:49:35,015 --> 00:49:36,103
It's okay, it's
okay, sit back down.

514
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:37,061
It's all right.

515
00:49:37,148 --> 00:49:39,150
Let me see, come on.

516
00:49:41,761 --> 00:49:43,110
My God, You hit it.

517
00:49:45,591 --> 00:49:47,723
I'm gonna fix
this shitty airplane.

518
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:49,334
I'm gonna get us
to the boat town, okay?

519
00:50:01,128 --> 00:50:04,305
Well, did you find anything?

520
00:50:05,089 --> 00:50:06,090
Nope.

521
00:50:07,961 --> 00:50:09,354
He can fix it, right?

522
00:50:11,834 --> 00:50:14,881
Well, you're the
aviation expert, right?

523
00:50:14,968 --> 00:50:16,100
How should I know?

524
00:50:26,153 --> 00:50:27,937
Hate that I'm always right.

525
00:50:34,118 --> 00:50:35,423
Come on, let's move.

526
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:36,642
Fucking hell.

527
00:50:39,514 --> 00:50:40,950
Nearly there.

528
00:50:42,517 --> 00:50:43,866
What is it now?

529
00:50:43,953 --> 00:50:45,433
I don't
know and I don't care.

530
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:47,044
No, I know.

531
00:50:47,131 --> 00:50:48,132
When can we take off?

532
00:50:48,219 --> 00:50:49,524
Why isn't the plane ready?

533
00:50:49,611 --> 00:50:50,482
It's a fucking airplane.

534
00:50:50,569 --> 00:50:51,396
Are you okay?

535
00:50:51,483 --> 00:50:53,093
No, we got three minutes.

536
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:54,486
Wait, what
happens in three minutes?

537
00:50:54,573 --> 00:50:55,835
They're coming.

538
00:50:55,922 --> 00:50:57,619
No, no, no, we won't be ready.

539
00:50:57,706 --> 00:50:59,230
They're coming.

540
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:01,449
I don't wanna die here, honey.

541
00:51:01,536 --> 00:51:02,537
Please hurry up.

542
00:51:05,627 --> 00:51:07,629
Yeah, you probably
should have started with that.

543
00:51:07,716 --> 00:51:09,414
Maybe, but it's
all the same now, isn't it?

544
00:51:15,159 --> 00:51:16,943
60 seconds, be ready.

545
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:18,118
Go, go, go.

546
00:51:20,642 --> 00:51:21,774
Can anybody pray?

547
00:51:21,861 --> 00:51:23,297
Our Father who liveth
out there.

548
00:51:23,384 --> 00:51:24,516
Those are the wrong words.

549
00:51:24,603 --> 00:51:25,908
Just go!

550
00:51:25,995 --> 00:51:27,606
It won't help!

551
00:51:29,651 --> 00:51:31,392
Let's go, move it.

552
00:51:34,874 --> 00:51:36,005
Come on!

553
00:51:59,507 --> 00:52:00,465
It's too slow.

554
00:52:02,467 --> 00:52:03,032
They're gonna catch this.

555
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,121
We gotta go faster,

556
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:05,687
- we're not gonna make it.
- I'm trying!

557
00:52:15,349 --> 00:52:16,829
They're catching us.

558
00:52:21,355 --> 00:52:22,269
Got 'em.

559
00:52:22,835 --> 00:52:24,097
The carburetor.

560
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:26,360
The red button.

561
00:52:26,447 --> 00:52:27,709
Do it!

562
00:52:34,368 --> 00:52:36,501
Okay, that's it.

563
00:53:01,265 --> 00:53:04,485
All right, all
right.

564
00:53:12,145 --> 00:53:15,714
All right, all
right.

565
00:53:15,801 --> 00:53:17,281
That was close.

566
00:53:17,368 --> 00:53:19,457
I know.

567
00:53:19,544 --> 00:53:21,023
Oh my God.

568
00:53:22,634 --> 00:53:25,419
You got it, you got it.

569
00:53:25,506 --> 00:53:26,594
Oh.

570
00:53:27,421 --> 00:53:28,683
Well done, Abby.

571
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:30,729
Well done.

572
00:53:53,404 --> 00:53:54,666
Hey, what's happening?

573
00:53:54,753 --> 00:53:56,015
I can't hold it.

574
00:53:56,102 --> 00:53:57,016
What?

575
00:53:57,103 --> 00:54:00,149
What the fuck?!

576
00:54:02,108 --> 00:54:03,240
I don't know what to do.

577
00:54:03,327 --> 00:54:04,676
Abigail, you're
gonna land this thing,

578
00:54:04,763 --> 00:54:05,633
or we're all gonna die.

579
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,244
What?

580
00:54:09,333 --> 00:54:10,464
Over there, over there.

581
00:54:10,551 --> 00:54:12,597
Okay, okay.

582
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,382
We're going down.
Brace for impact, okay?

583
00:54:16,165 --> 00:54:17,166
Okay.

584
00:54:38,318 --> 00:54:39,841
You alright?

585
00:54:43,236 --> 00:54:44,324
Yeah.

586
00:54:45,238 --> 00:54:47,893
Told you I needed more time.

587
00:54:56,467 --> 00:54:57,990
Okay, I gotcha.

588
00:54:58,077 --> 00:54:59,426
Okay.

589
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:09,654
Okay, let's just go.

590
00:55:09,741 --> 00:55:13,832
No, let's find somewhere to
rest and eat, okay?

591
00:55:14,963 --> 00:55:16,791
Okay, okay.

592
00:55:16,878 --> 00:55:19,794
All right, all right, let's go.

593
00:55:26,932 --> 00:55:28,412
Fucking hate flying.

594
00:57:00,939 --> 00:57:02,810
All right, new plan.

595
00:57:02,897 --> 00:57:03,724
We're here.

596
00:57:04,638 --> 00:57:07,336
The riverbank and the colony

597
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:08,903
are on the
other side of these hills.

598
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,428
Now we can
get there in two days.

599
00:57:15,736 --> 00:57:17,477
Ammo?

600
00:57:17,564 --> 00:57:18,957
Um...

601
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:22,700
Seven and eight?

602
00:57:23,875 --> 00:57:25,920
Seven and eight?

603
00:57:28,357 --> 00:57:31,839
Okay, let's get some rest.

604
00:57:33,058 --> 00:57:35,364
We're leaving first light.

605
00:57:49,117 --> 00:57:51,380
Are you still mad at me?

606
00:57:53,121 --> 00:57:54,427
How can I stay mad at you?

607
00:58:07,005 --> 00:58:08,441
Sleep well, my love.

608
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:06,934
Chicken.

609
00:59:07,021 --> 00:59:08,457
Yum.

610
00:59:10,459 --> 00:59:12,549
Sorry, I got hungry.

611
00:59:20,208 --> 00:59:21,558
Thank you.

612
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:26,606
So good.

613
00:59:28,739 --> 00:59:29,696
Wait.

614
00:59:41,665 --> 00:59:43,536
A little thank you.

615
00:59:49,237 --> 00:59:52,197
You know, you
remind me of my wife.

616
00:59:53,024 --> 00:59:55,940
Whenever she had something
to say, she could never hide it.

617
00:59:56,027 --> 00:59:59,770
Those little wrinkles
dancing on the edge of her lips.

618
00:59:59,857 --> 01:00:01,162
Busted.

619
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:04,426
I know what you're thinking.

620
01:00:05,427 --> 01:00:08,822
But you know what's
right for us better than we do.

621
01:00:08,909 --> 01:00:10,476
We rely on each other.

622
01:00:11,869 --> 01:00:14,872
That won't
change, even if we help you.

623
01:00:16,525 --> 01:00:18,223
She's stronger than you think.

624
01:00:21,966 --> 01:00:22,836
Yeah.

625
01:00:25,796 --> 01:00:27,362
It's not about that.

626
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:31,802
What then?

627
01:00:36,371 --> 01:00:37,721
I killed her mom.

628
01:00:39,026 --> 01:00:40,593
And her brother.

629
01:00:41,986 --> 01:00:44,423
How else could
I make it up to her?

630
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:46,555
But to look after her.

631
01:00:50,211 --> 01:00:51,996
I'm sorry.

632
01:00:52,083 --> 01:00:52,910
I really am.

633
01:00:54,868 --> 01:00:57,131
But you saved her as well.

634
01:00:58,219 --> 01:01:00,178
And that's enough.

635
01:01:00,265 --> 01:01:01,788
In this world it is.

636
01:01:03,007 --> 01:01:05,574
You know, there was this kid,

637
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:08,055
three months
after the infection.

638
01:01:09,361 --> 01:01:11,058
Jimmy.

639
01:01:12,538 --> 01:01:14,671
Now his mom had gotten
so stoned

640
01:01:16,063 --> 01:01:17,369
that she didn't
even wake up when a feral

641
01:01:17,456 --> 01:01:18,805
was skinning her body.

642
01:01:22,026 --> 01:01:23,027
We saved him.

643
01:01:24,898 --> 01:01:26,291
He was a good kid.

644
01:01:27,422 --> 01:01:28,772
A smart kid.

645
01:01:31,252 --> 01:01:33,690
And a cheeky little
rascal at the same time.

646
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:38,477
He never listened to me.

647
01:01:40,653 --> 01:01:45,397
Well, one day a feral bit
his finger clean off and

648
01:01:47,138 --> 01:01:48,400
you know what
happens when a wound doesn't

649
01:01:48,487 --> 01:01:49,923
hit an artery, right?

650
01:01:51,577 --> 01:01:53,884
It takes days
until you totally transform.

651
01:01:56,408 --> 01:01:58,018
He was the first.

652
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:01,674
And the last that I
ever watched go through that.

653
01:02:06,331 --> 01:02:08,899
Never again did I
wait for the transformation.

654
01:02:13,251 --> 01:02:14,643
And there was Patrick,

655
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,167
and Sarah.

656
01:02:18,473 --> 01:02:19,561
Sometimes you just gotta run

657
01:02:19,648 --> 01:02:22,782
and only worry about yourselves.

658
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:26,743
Joe.

659
01:02:27,526 --> 01:02:28,832
Linda.

660
01:02:28,919 --> 01:02:31,835
That was the first
time I watched someone die.

661
01:02:31,922 --> 01:02:34,011
Rather than lose the other.

662
01:02:34,098 --> 01:02:35,664
Jess.

663
01:02:36,927 --> 01:02:40,495
Jess.

664
01:02:42,367 --> 01:02:44,108
She simply grabbed
a rope when she couldn't

665
01:02:44,195 --> 01:02:45,718
take it any longer and...

666
01:02:51,202 --> 01:02:53,770
Sometimes I feel that...

667
01:02:54,379 --> 01:02:57,295
I don't have the space

668
01:02:57,382 --> 01:03:00,602
for all the faces in my brain.

669
01:03:03,301 --> 01:03:04,258
Dying.

670
01:03:06,217 --> 01:03:07,871
Dying is nothing.

671
01:03:09,873 --> 01:03:12,571
Losing someone
who is important to you.

672
01:03:14,573 --> 01:03:16,401
That's different.

673
01:03:19,665 --> 01:03:23,974
Yeah, you know sometimes
you just don't need more space.

674
01:03:25,845 --> 01:03:30,502
Sometimes it's
just about letting them go.

675
01:03:30,589 --> 01:03:34,811
You did everything you
could, Cassius, I can tell.

676
01:03:34,898 --> 01:03:38,336
It's time to let her
stand on her own two feet.

677
01:03:39,511 --> 01:03:41,208
Don't worry, you
trained her really well.

678
01:03:41,295 --> 01:03:42,601
Just trust her.

679
01:03:44,037 --> 01:03:45,952
She will always be there.

680
01:03:46,561 --> 01:03:48,781
They always are.

681
01:04:17,984 --> 01:04:19,812
Hey, um...

682
01:04:21,031 --> 01:04:22,510
thanks for the gift.

683
01:04:27,211 --> 01:04:29,517
Now, let's get some sleep, huh?

684
01:04:29,604 --> 01:04:31,650
Got a tough day tomorrow.

685
01:04:31,737 --> 01:04:32,869
Yeah.

686
01:05:25,573 --> 01:05:28,141
This place has been farmed.

687
01:05:28,228 --> 01:05:29,926
Must be people around.

688
01:05:51,817 --> 01:05:52,992
Ahh!

689
01:05:53,079 --> 01:05:53,950
What is it?

690
01:05:54,689 --> 01:05:55,777
Are you okay?

691
01:05:56,387 --> 01:05:58,215
Oh my God, you're burning up.

692
01:05:58,302 --> 01:06:00,260
- Are you okay?
- I just need some rest.

693
01:06:00,347 --> 01:06:01,435
Let me see.

694
01:06:03,176 --> 01:06:04,873
Let me change
your bandage.

695
01:06:10,879 --> 01:06:12,881
Stop, I'm alright.

696
01:06:15,493 --> 01:06:17,974
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

697
01:06:39,821 --> 01:06:42,520
Don't say a
fucking word, jackass.

698
01:06:44,565 --> 01:06:46,045
When were you gonna tell?

699
01:06:46,132 --> 01:06:47,394
Tell what?

700
01:06:47,481 --> 01:06:48,482
Tell what?

701
01:06:51,398 --> 01:06:53,792
I should kill you
right here, right now.

702
01:06:59,363 --> 01:07:00,929
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't shoot you right

703
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:02,583
this fucking second.

704
01:07:03,193 --> 01:07:05,586
Cassius,
we found something.

705
01:07:05,673 --> 01:07:09,025
Yeah, me too.

706
01:07:09,112 --> 01:07:10,330
Coming.

707
01:07:12,637 --> 01:07:14,030
Pull yourself together.

708
01:07:14,117 --> 01:07:15,814
Think about
how you'd like to die.

709
01:07:15,901 --> 01:07:18,382
You have that choice for now.

710
01:07:48,673 --> 01:07:51,980
Who are you
and what do you want?

711
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:59,205
Abigail, stop.

712
01:07:59,292 --> 01:08:00,685
We are peaceful travelers.

713
01:08:00,772 --> 01:08:02,600
We just need some rest.

714
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:04,428
There's
nothing here to take.

715
01:08:04,515 --> 01:08:05,907
Abigail, hey.

716
01:08:06,691 --> 01:08:08,301
My name is Abigail.

717
01:08:08,388 --> 01:08:09,781
We are travelers
with a pregnant woman.

718
01:08:09,868 --> 01:08:11,217
We just need a little help.

719
01:08:33,152 --> 01:08:35,111
All right, that's far enough.

720
01:08:37,287 --> 01:08:38,940
We need medicine...

721
01:08:39,027 --> 01:08:41,247
and something to eat.

722
01:08:41,334 --> 01:08:43,902
We can even pay you if
you ask a reasonable price.

723
01:08:51,692 --> 01:08:55,043
All right, put all
your weapons in the chest.

724
01:08:56,436 --> 01:08:57,263
You too.

725
01:08:59,874 --> 01:09:02,486
You two, come up here where
I can see you in the light.

726
01:09:15,063 --> 01:09:18,545
Uh-uh, all of them.

727
01:09:26,771 --> 01:09:30,078
That's better, thank you.

728
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:33,691
Well, come on inside then.

729
01:09:37,042 --> 01:09:38,783
Well...

730
01:09:38,870 --> 01:09:39,740
Um...

731
01:09:39,827 --> 01:09:42,134
welcome to my uh, humble
abode.

732
01:09:42,743 --> 01:09:44,441
Oh gosh, needless to say,

733
01:09:44,528 --> 01:09:47,183
I rarely get
visitors these days.

734
01:09:48,271 --> 01:09:49,750
When was the last time?

735
01:09:49,837 --> 01:09:51,665
God only knows.

736
01:09:51,752 --> 01:09:53,493
You have electricity.

737
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:55,756
I do, yes.

738
01:09:55,843 --> 01:09:58,933
Not much, just
enough for my research.

739
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:00,065
You're some kind
of scientist?

740
01:10:00,152 --> 01:10:02,850
I am, I...

741
01:10:02,937 --> 01:10:05,462
graduated as an engineer.

742
01:10:05,549 --> 01:10:08,508
Myself and my wife,
we did our research together.

743
01:10:08,595 --> 01:10:10,684
Your wife?

744
01:10:10,771 --> 01:10:12,469
Huh, where is she?

745
01:10:13,948 --> 01:10:15,776
Fortunately, I
have plenty of books.

746
01:10:15,863 --> 01:10:17,952
I've figured everything
out for inside the house.

747
01:10:18,039 --> 01:10:21,478
I have geothermal electricity,
which provides hot water.

748
01:10:21,565 --> 01:10:22,653
Hot water?

749
01:10:22,740 --> 01:10:24,176
You have hot water?

750
01:10:24,263 --> 01:10:26,309
Oh, I have
everything you need, my dear.

751
01:10:26,396 --> 01:10:27,353
Except meat.

752
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:29,529
That I don't eat anymore,

753
01:10:29,616 --> 01:10:32,315
but I have my own vegetables and
fruit.

754
01:10:32,402 --> 01:10:36,536
I even have some bread.

755
01:10:36,623 --> 01:10:38,886
It's a little bit
dry, but the old flavors, eh,

756
01:10:38,973 --> 01:10:40,714
you can't beat them, can you?

757
01:10:41,367 --> 01:10:43,151
Now don't get too used to it,

758
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:44,631
otherwise we won't be
able to get rid of you, will I?

759
01:10:47,068 --> 01:10:48,026
Well, what are you waiting for?

760
01:10:48,113 --> 01:10:49,636
Come on, take a seat.

761
01:10:49,723 --> 01:10:52,160
Sorry about the wait,
here you go.

762
01:10:53,814 --> 01:10:55,599
Yes, thank you.

763
01:10:55,686 --> 01:10:57,383
Bon appetit.

764
01:12:44,838 --> 01:12:45,970
Hey.

765
01:12:46,057 --> 01:12:46,927
Hey.

766
01:12:48,451 --> 01:12:49,582
You okay?

767
01:12:49,669 --> 01:12:50,714
Yeah.

768
01:12:51,932 --> 01:12:54,979
And I just sometimes ask
myself how I'm gonna hold out.

769
01:12:55,066 --> 01:12:56,502
Listen.

770
01:12:58,199 --> 01:12:59,940
Everything's
gonna be just fine.

771
01:13:00,767 --> 01:13:02,378
I'm scared.

772
01:13:04,031 --> 01:13:07,121
Since we've been here,
I don't feel the baby moving.

773
01:13:08,688 --> 01:13:10,647
Trust me...

774
01:13:10,734 --> 01:13:12,300
Once we get there,

775
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:15,826
you won't keep that
big boy inside.

776
01:13:15,913 --> 01:13:17,654
Or a big girl.

777
01:13:17,741 --> 01:13:20,396
Or a big girl.

778
01:13:22,702 --> 01:13:24,835
Cassius.

779
01:13:25,488 --> 01:13:27,490
Promise me,
if anything happens to me,

780
01:13:27,577 --> 01:13:30,580
you look after her, please.

781
01:13:37,369 --> 01:13:39,023
I promise.

782
01:13:44,202 --> 01:13:46,247
Thank you.

783
01:13:50,121 --> 01:13:51,731
Cheers!

784
01:13:51,818 --> 01:13:55,039
Well, non-alcoholic
for the mother to be.

785
01:13:55,126 --> 01:13:56,040
Thank you.

786
01:13:56,780 --> 01:14:00,305
And a little homemade
surprise for the rest of you.

787
01:14:00,392 --> 01:14:02,046
Oh, it's an excellent year.

788
01:14:02,133 --> 01:14:04,004
I'm very proud of it.

789
01:14:04,091 --> 01:14:05,832
Cheers!

790
01:14:05,919 --> 01:14:06,920
Mm.

791
01:14:07,007 --> 01:14:07,965
- Mm.
- Cheers.

792
01:14:08,052 --> 01:14:09,053
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

793
01:14:10,533 --> 01:14:13,318
So, uh, how
long you been living here?

794
01:14:13,405 --> 01:14:14,711
Me? Oh,

795
01:14:14,798 --> 01:14:17,409
over 20 years. Yes.

796
01:14:17,496 --> 01:14:20,064
First with my wife, and now, uh,
well,

797
01:14:20,151 --> 01:14:23,023
now I'm on my own, yes.

798
01:14:23,110 --> 01:14:25,286
And what about yourselves?
Where are you headed to?

799
01:14:25,373 --> 01:14:26,984
To the colony.

800
01:14:27,071 --> 01:14:29,247
Oh, brilliant
idea. Yes, I speak to

801
01:14:29,334 --> 01:14:31,510
them from time to
time through my radio.

802
01:14:31,597 --> 01:14:33,164
How come
you're not with them?

803
01:14:33,251 --> 01:14:35,383
Surely your knowledge would
come in handy at the colony.

804
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:37,298
Oh, that's
very kind of you, dear.

805
01:14:37,385 --> 01:14:38,909
But I think
I'm better off here.

806
01:14:38,996 --> 01:14:42,390
I mean, even before
civilization, how shall I say,

807
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:44,610
disappeared into the abyss.

808
01:14:44,697 --> 01:14:47,352
Now, I was never
impressed by crowded cities

809
01:14:47,439 --> 01:14:50,050
and all that
kind of ostentation.

810
01:14:50,137 --> 01:14:51,574
I mean, we used
to go there for work,

811
01:14:51,661 --> 01:14:54,707
but real life is
here far away from all that.

812
01:14:54,794 --> 01:14:56,970
Yeah. Yeah,
I hear you, buddy.

813
01:14:58,145 --> 01:14:59,625
Yes, I mean,
don't misunderstand me.

814
01:14:59,712 --> 01:15:01,714
I have no problem
with the people at the colony.

815
01:15:01,801 --> 01:15:06,632
And I am sure it's a very nice,
cozy place these days.

816
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:09,940
I just don't understand
all that fitful adherence

817
01:15:10,027 --> 01:15:11,463
to, you know, the old things.

818
01:15:11,550 --> 01:15:13,770
I mean, there
was chaos even before.

819
01:15:13,857 --> 01:15:15,380
Excuse me?

820
01:15:15,467 --> 01:15:17,948
Oh, come on,
you know what I mean.

821
01:15:18,035 --> 01:15:19,645
How we got here?

822
01:15:19,732 --> 01:15:21,604
Over seven billion people,

823
01:15:21,691 --> 01:15:23,475
all selfishly
trying to one-up each other

824
01:15:23,562 --> 01:15:26,086
and not giving a
shit about the consequences.

825
01:15:26,173 --> 01:15:29,960
I mean, Christ, there wasn't
even enough food and water.

826
01:15:30,047 --> 01:15:32,136
But, oh, no, we all
had to have another one of this

827
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:33,354
and another one of that,

828
01:15:33,441 --> 01:15:35,792
scrounging around
until the end of days.

829
01:15:35,879 --> 01:15:38,359
I mean, what happened was
necessary

830
01:15:38,446 --> 01:15:40,536
Yeah, but it was still awful.

831
01:15:40,623 --> 01:15:43,974
Well, that's
besides the point, my darling.

832
01:15:44,061 --> 01:15:46,454
It was heavenly for the virus.

833
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:48,021
And as for us
human beings, well,

834
01:15:48,108 --> 01:15:51,808
it was just the
next stage in our evolution.

835
01:15:51,895 --> 01:15:53,113
Next stage?

836
01:15:54,027 --> 01:15:55,812
Don't you see?

837
01:15:55,899 --> 01:15:57,640
The strong have survived.

838
01:15:57,727 --> 01:16:01,121
And, my friends, only
the strong should survive.

839
01:16:02,862 --> 01:16:04,734
That sounds cruel.

840
01:16:04,821 --> 01:16:07,258
Oh, don't you worry about me.
It's just my opinion.

841
01:16:07,345 --> 01:16:11,262
I mean, one violent
world replaced by another.

842
01:16:11,349 --> 01:16:14,352
The Neanderthal was
overtaken by the homosapien.

843
01:16:14,439 --> 01:16:17,790
Evolution didn't stop,
and it's not going to stop now.

844
01:16:17,877 --> 01:16:20,837
How on earth can
you compare this to evolution?

845
01:16:20,924 --> 01:16:24,057
Life doesn't care
about opinions, my dear.

846
01:16:24,144 --> 01:16:25,711
Especially not ours.

847
01:16:25,798 --> 01:16:28,758
I mean, come on,
we did deserve the punishment.

848
01:16:28,845 --> 01:16:30,411
We thought we were
so superior,

849
01:16:30,498 --> 01:16:31,674
but, I mean, a top predator

850
01:16:31,761 --> 01:16:34,633
that uses up
all its own resources,

851
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:36,287
preys on those of others,

852
01:16:36,374 --> 01:16:38,463
is destined for annihilation.

853
01:16:38,550 --> 01:16:41,814
Evolution is
always a correction.

854
01:16:41,901 --> 01:16:44,338
Homo sapiens cruentus.

855
01:16:44,425 --> 01:16:47,515
Somehow I get the feeling
that you're on their side.

856
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:51,258
I am just a
realist, my friend.

857
01:16:51,345 --> 01:16:54,305
I mean, all our
attempts have been in vain.

858
01:16:54,392 --> 01:16:57,700
There is nothing we can do.

859
01:16:57,787 --> 01:17:00,485
In a few generations, we won't

860
01:17:00,572 --> 01:17:04,707
even be here to
remember all of this.

861
01:17:07,187 --> 01:17:09,755
Back to the
instincts of the beasts,

862
01:17:09,842 --> 01:17:13,280
from civilized
naivety in a matter of moments,

863
01:17:13,367 --> 01:17:14,281
hours,

864
01:17:14,368 --> 01:17:15,543
days.

865
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:18,329
I'd much rather
die than live like this.

866
01:17:18,416 --> 01:17:20,940
Oh, no, you
wouldn't, my dear.

867
01:17:21,027 --> 01:17:25,075
Living's always better than
dying.

868
01:17:25,162 --> 01:17:26,685
What about a cure?

869
01:17:26,772 --> 01:17:29,209
There could be one, right?

870
01:17:29,296 --> 01:17:31,995
No, unfortunately, there is
none.

871
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:36,129
The moment that
virus enters your body,

872
01:17:36,216 --> 01:17:38,479
it's over, finito.

873
01:17:39,002 --> 01:17:40,264
Might as well
just shoot

874
01:17:40,351 --> 01:17:42,832
yourself in the
head, but why would you?

875
01:17:43,397 --> 01:17:45,356
Because that's no life.

876
01:17:46,009 --> 01:17:47,445
And who decides?

877
01:17:49,403 --> 01:17:54,974
Even human beings
only ever want to survive.

878
01:17:55,061 --> 01:17:56,280
So simple.

879
01:17:56,367 --> 01:17:58,021
Are you okay?

880
01:17:58,108 --> 01:17:59,631
Yeah, I'm okay.

881
01:17:59,718 --> 01:18:01,677
Oh, don't
you worry about him.

882
01:18:01,764 --> 01:18:04,810
He just needs a little
rest and he'll be just fine.

883
01:18:04,897 --> 01:18:06,594
You won't even
remember this little

884
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:09,032
inconvenience
that I can promise you.

885
01:18:09,119 --> 01:18:11,164
I'd love to offer you all
another drink,

886
01:18:11,251 --> 01:18:13,427
but unfortunately,

887
01:18:13,514 --> 01:18:16,735
we haven't got much time left.

888
01:18:46,330 --> 01:18:49,202
Ah, I thought so.

889
01:18:51,552 --> 01:18:52,684
Do you know
what this is?

890
01:18:54,294 --> 01:18:56,383
Well, let's just say it's a
special kind of dog whistle

891
01:18:56,470 --> 01:18:59,299
that only
works on the infected.

892
01:18:59,386 --> 01:19:00,953
So my question is--

893
01:19:06,045 --> 01:19:08,526
What are you?

894
01:19:29,895 --> 01:19:31,244
Hey.

895
01:19:40,514 --> 01:19:41,777
Hey.

896
01:19:46,564 --> 01:19:48,348
Where are we?

897
01:19:48,435 --> 01:19:49,959
What do you want with us?

898
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:52,091
Radio frequency.

899
01:19:52,178 --> 01:19:54,877
Motivator test 18.

900
01:19:54,964 --> 01:19:56,617
Participants four travelers

901
01:19:56,704 --> 01:19:58,489
two male, two female.

902
01:19:58,576 --> 01:20:00,447
One of them is pregnant.

903
01:20:00,534 --> 01:20:03,799
Condition of the subjects.

904
01:20:03,886 --> 01:20:05,496
Satisfactory.

905
01:20:05,583 --> 01:20:06,584
Hey.

906
01:20:07,585 --> 01:20:09,108
What's going on?

907
01:20:09,195 --> 01:20:10,501
Drugged us.

908
01:20:10,588 --> 01:20:13,069
Please don't hurt us.

909
01:20:13,156 --> 01:20:14,897
We never cause you any harm.

910
01:20:14,984 --> 01:20:17,334
It doesn't
matter now, my darling.

911
01:20:17,421 --> 01:20:20,119
I've got plans for you.

912
01:20:20,206 --> 01:20:21,599
What plans?

913
01:20:21,686 --> 01:20:26,082
Even I can't skip the tests.

914
01:20:26,169 --> 01:20:30,303
Now, who knows what this is?

915
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:32,697
This little wristlet

916
01:20:32,784 --> 01:20:35,918
emits a sound
frequency that the infected

917
01:20:36,005 --> 01:20:38,790
are unable to bear.

918
01:20:38,877 --> 01:20:43,795
Or if I change
it, unable to resist.

919
01:20:43,882 --> 01:20:48,626
I need no fence,
nor do I need weapons.

920
01:20:48,713 --> 01:20:51,977
I need no other protection.

921
01:20:52,064 --> 01:20:54,153
You could save others.

922
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:55,763
Why don't you help them?

923
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:58,375
Now, why would I want to do
that when I've got other plans?

924
01:20:58,462 --> 01:21:01,465
You really are crazy!

925
01:21:02,248 --> 01:21:03,946
I know what you think.

926
01:21:04,033 --> 01:21:06,426
You think I'm the bad guy.

927
01:21:06,513 --> 01:21:12,215
But I am merely the shepherd
of this brand new world.

928
01:21:12,302 --> 01:21:15,348
The time of mankind has gone.

929
01:21:15,435 --> 01:21:17,220
You bloody bastard.

930
01:21:22,834 --> 01:21:25,532
Oh, by the
way, since you asked,

931
01:21:25,619 --> 01:21:27,883
don't you want to meet my wife?

932
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:36,152
Anyway, I'm eager to
find out what you're capable of.

933
01:21:39,764 --> 01:21:42,810
Particularly
because you've been bitten.

934
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:44,987
What?

935
01:22:23,286 --> 01:22:24,200
No!

936
01:22:26,115 --> 01:22:27,116
Would you call this?

937
01:22:27,203 --> 01:22:28,378
Another fuck up.

938
01:22:31,511 --> 01:22:32,860
Come on, let's go!

939
01:22:42,044 --> 01:22:43,915
Abigail, get the car keys!

940
01:22:52,315 --> 01:22:53,751
No!

941
01:22:53,838 --> 01:22:54,708
You idiot!

942
01:22:56,232 --> 01:22:57,537
Stop it!

943
01:22:57,624 --> 01:22:59,496
Look, you knew damn
well he can't come with us!

944
01:22:59,583 --> 01:23:00,976
Let me help, while I can.

945
01:23:01,063 --> 01:23:02,673
Tell me why I
shouldn't fucking kill him!

946
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:03,979
Because it's not up to us.

947
01:23:04,066 --> 01:23:05,589
Not yet.
We gotta go.

948
01:23:11,725 --> 01:23:12,509
What happened?

949
01:23:12,596 --> 01:23:14,424
My water just broke.

950
01:23:49,415 --> 01:23:50,242
You broke my nose.

951
01:23:50,329 --> 01:23:51,461
Boo
fucking hoo?

952
01:23:51,548 --> 01:23:52,984
That's the least of your
problems, tough guy.

953
01:23:53,724 --> 01:23:55,160
The baby's coming.

954
01:24:06,389 --> 01:24:07,346
Hold on!

955
01:24:19,967 --> 01:24:21,099
There.

956
01:24:21,186 --> 01:24:22,057
Lights.

957
01:24:23,232 --> 01:24:24,537
The colony.

958
01:24:38,551 --> 01:24:40,031
Everybody out!

959
01:24:51,521 --> 01:24:52,348
I'm out of ammo!

960
01:24:55,829 --> 01:24:57,222
Go, I'll buy you some time.

961
01:24:58,049 --> 01:24:59,964
No. No.

962
01:25:00,051 --> 01:25:01,444
I'll always be with you.

963
01:25:01,531 --> 01:25:03,446
Tell that big boy I love him.
Okay?

964
01:25:04,577 --> 01:25:05,839
Come on!

965
01:25:06,971 --> 01:25:07,841
Hey!

966
01:25:12,324 --> 01:25:13,282
Go! Go!

967
01:26:17,694 --> 01:26:18,434
Run!

968
01:26:18,521 --> 01:26:19,870
Go!

969
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:37,540
Wake up.

970
01:26:42,632 --> 01:26:44,199
Hey!

971
01:26:45,069 --> 01:26:46,026
Hey!

972
01:26:46,113 --> 01:26:47,898
Hey, help!

973
01:26:51,771 --> 01:26:52,816
We should help them.

974
01:26:52,903 --> 01:26:54,296
Quiet.

975
01:26:54,383 --> 01:26:55,297
Just wait.

976
01:26:56,298 --> 01:26:57,037
Hey!

977
01:26:57,124 --> 01:26:58,909
Hey, help!

978
01:28:17,161 --> 01:28:18,380
Shh, you can do this.

979
01:28:18,467 --> 01:28:19,294
You can do this.

980
01:28:19,381 --> 01:28:20,207
Lie down.

981
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:21,557
Breathe! Breathe!

982
01:28:22,906 --> 01:28:23,733
She needs to rest.

983
01:28:23,820 --> 01:28:24,995
Leave her.

984
01:28:36,267 --> 01:28:38,225
That was nice, man.

985
01:28:42,055 --> 01:28:43,622
You didn't get bit, did you?

986
01:28:45,407 --> 01:28:46,625
No.

987
01:28:46,712 --> 01:28:47,670
All right.

988
01:28:47,757 --> 01:28:49,106
We're still gonna check you.

989
01:28:49,193 --> 01:28:50,586
Go ahead.

990
01:28:50,673 --> 01:28:51,804
Shoot them all?

991
01:28:51,891 --> 01:28:52,892
Sure did.

992
01:28:52,979 --> 01:28:54,154
No worries, man.

993
01:28:54,241 --> 01:28:55,330
You're safe.

994
01:28:55,417 --> 01:28:57,593
Welcome to the King's Harbor.

995
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:59,290
The King's Harbor?

996
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:02,249
What a fucking shithole.

997
01:29:09,692 --> 01:29:11,258
Keep an eye on them.

998
01:29:11,346 --> 01:29:12,695
All right, boss.

999
01:29:13,435 --> 01:29:14,305
I will do.

1000
01:29:32,802 --> 01:29:34,456
You see, my friend,

1001
01:29:36,936 --> 01:29:38,938
living is always better.

1002
01:30:02,701 --> 01:30:03,833
Stop!

1003
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:04,964
Right there.

1004
01:30:12,232 --> 01:30:15,148
My name's
George, head of the colony.

1005
01:30:15,235 --> 01:30:18,543
I can't tell you how glad
we are that you guys are here.

1006
01:30:18,630 --> 01:30:20,763
We thought there was no
one else alive except for us

1007
01:30:20,850 --> 01:30:22,852
and that loony scientist.

1008
01:30:24,027 --> 01:30:24,810
Where are you from?

1009
01:30:24,897 --> 01:30:26,159
The woman.

1010
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:30,337
Megan. She comes
from a distant colony.

1011
01:30:31,382 --> 01:30:34,516
And
we've--we've been traveling.

1012
01:30:35,734 --> 01:30:37,040
I see.

1013
01:30:37,127 --> 01:30:39,085
Don't worry about your past.

1014
01:30:39,651 --> 01:30:43,002
Some folks here might be worried
you brought some infection

1015
01:30:43,089 --> 01:30:47,485
or that you'd cut
their throats in their sleep.

1016
01:30:48,051 --> 01:30:50,270
But that's not true, right?

1017
01:30:51,663 --> 01:30:52,490
No.

1018
01:30:54,797 --> 01:30:55,667
Of course it's not.

1019
01:30:56,625 --> 01:30:58,017
Anyway, there's
nothing here to be taken.

1020
01:30:58,975 --> 01:31:00,193
And I hear
you guys are clean.

1021
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:02,195
I am personally very happy for

1022
01:31:02,282 --> 01:31:04,459
all the
helping hands we can get.

1023
01:31:05,242 --> 01:31:07,070
Now go get some rest.

1024
01:31:07,157 --> 01:31:08,767
You've had a tough day.

1025
01:31:21,954 --> 01:31:22,825
Where are you going?

1026
01:31:22,912 --> 01:31:23,652
I need some time on my own.

1027
01:31:23,739 --> 01:31:24,827
Hey,

1028
01:31:24,914 --> 01:31:26,698
don't wander off.

1029
01:31:26,785 --> 01:31:28,700
We're moving on. First light.

1030
01:31:28,787 --> 01:31:30,572
What if I
don't want to move on?

1031
01:31:33,923 --> 01:31:35,577
It always
starts like this, Abigail.

1032
01:31:35,664 --> 01:31:37,927
First, everything is exciting.

1033
01:31:38,014 --> 01:31:39,798
Everyone is nice.

1034
01:31:39,885 --> 01:31:43,759
Then it turns out
that they're also just humans.

1035
01:31:43,846 --> 01:31:46,588
Listen, you saw the
way the men were looking at you.

1036
01:31:46,675 --> 01:31:48,024
Come on.

1037
01:31:48,111 --> 01:31:49,939
I can protect myself.

1038
01:31:50,026 --> 01:31:51,897
Still, we're
not staying.

1039
01:31:51,984 --> 01:31:53,812
That's it.
Discussion is over.

1040
01:31:53,899 --> 01:31:55,161
It's over?

1041
01:31:55,248 --> 01:31:56,598
You're not my dad!
Don't tell me what to do!

1042
01:31:56,685 --> 01:31:57,773
I'll stay if I want to.

1043
01:31:57,860 --> 01:31:59,078
Hey, hey, hey.

1044
01:31:59,688 --> 01:32:01,167
The past couple
of days, how many times

1045
01:32:01,254 --> 01:32:03,387
did we nearly
die because of you, huh?

1046
01:32:03,474 --> 01:32:05,215
Because you
didn't listen to me.

1047
01:32:05,302 --> 01:32:07,130
I told you.

1048
01:32:07,217 --> 01:32:08,087
We're better off alone.

1049
01:32:08,174 --> 01:32:09,698
You are better off alone.

1050
01:32:09,785 --> 01:32:10,612
You.

1051
01:32:11,308 --> 01:32:12,570
Not me anymore.

1052
01:32:31,067 --> 01:32:32,372
The baby's fine.

1053
01:32:33,504 --> 01:32:35,550
But the
woman's not gonna make it.

1054
01:32:36,289 --> 01:32:38,509
She's only got a
couple of hours left.

1055
01:32:40,250 --> 01:32:41,556
She wants to talk to you.

1056
01:32:58,355 --> 01:32:59,835
Hey!

1057
01:33:24,555 --> 01:33:25,730
Look at her.

1058
01:33:27,340 --> 01:33:29,386
She's beautiful.

1059
01:33:30,909 --> 01:33:32,955
Hello.

1060
01:33:33,042 --> 01:33:34,739
Hope.

1061
01:33:34,826 --> 01:33:36,219
Hope?

1062
01:33:37,133 --> 01:33:40,615
That's what she
brought to our life.

1063
01:33:43,008 --> 01:33:48,405
I'm going to see her grow
up and become a strong woman.

1064
01:33:49,145 --> 01:33:51,713
But if I don't,

1065
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:54,237
I need you to look after her.

1066
01:33:56,021 --> 01:33:58,633
Just like you
looked after Abigail.

1067
01:34:00,504 --> 01:34:01,244
I--

1068
01:34:01,331 --> 01:34:02,593
Please.

1069
01:34:05,465 --> 01:34:08,338
I know you kept your promise.

1070
01:34:08,425 --> 01:34:11,254
And you brought her to safety.

1071
01:34:11,863 --> 01:34:14,474
I know you'll
do everything.

1072
01:34:15,127 --> 01:34:16,651
Just promise me.

1073
01:34:18,130 --> 01:34:20,350
You'll teach her

1074
01:34:20,437 --> 01:34:22,744
how to stand on her feet.

1075
01:34:25,834 --> 01:34:26,835
Please.

1076
01:34:29,881 --> 01:34:30,708
I promise.

1077
01:35:31,813 --> 01:35:33,728
I'm sorry for your loss.

1078
01:35:36,034 --> 01:35:37,557
Can-can I?

1079
01:35:40,038 --> 01:35:41,126
Um,

1080
01:35:41,213 --> 01:35:42,867
sure, sure.

1081
01:35:48,481 --> 01:35:50,570
I'll be back
with her in a short while.

1082
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:52,747
Okay?

1083
01:36:28,391 --> 01:36:29,392
So what do you think

1084
01:36:29,479 --> 01:36:31,829
about a little old fashioned
revenge?

1085
01:36:34,963 --> 01:36:35,877
Fight!

1086
01:36:59,335 --> 01:37:00,510
You like it?

1087
01:37:01,119 --> 01:37:02,512
Well, then, what I'm going to
show you

1088
01:37:02,599 --> 01:37:03,992

1104
01:40:32,678 --> 01:40:33,897
Wouldn't be a good idea.

1105
01:40:35,246 --> 01:40:36,160
Why? What is it?

1106
01:40:37,118 --> 01:40:38,641
It's our little safeguard,

1107
01:40:38,728 --> 01:40:40,860
a plan B, if you will.

1108
01:40:40,947 --> 01:40:43,950
The entire boat
town is mined,

1109
01:40:44,038 --> 01:40:45,996
just in case,
the ferrals ever did enter.

1110
01:40:47,345 --> 01:40:49,739
But then you'd die as well?

1111
01:40:49,826 --> 01:40:52,002
Not necessarily.

1112
01:40:53,525 --> 01:40:55,005
What is it?

1113
01:40:55,092 --> 01:40:57,834
Back in the old days, a
huge dam was being built here,

1114
01:40:57,921 --> 01:40:59,792
so they
tunneled under the river.

1115
01:40:59,879 --> 01:41:03,144
The dam was never completed,
but the tunnel remained.

1116
01:41:03,231 --> 01:41:05,450
And we've
connected it to the boat town.

1117
01:41:05,537 --> 01:41:07,409
Connected?

1118
01:41:07,496 --> 01:41:08,323
Are there guards?

1119
01:41:08,410 --> 01:41:09,846
Is it safe?

1120
01:41:09,933 --> 01:41:11,543
Sure it is.

1121
01:41:11,630 --> 01:41:13,589
We've closed
down the other end.

1122
01:41:13,676 --> 01:41:16,548
If we're
attacked, we can escape.

1123
01:41:20,552 --> 01:41:21,423
Wow.

1124
01:41:22,511 --> 01:41:23,686
Wow it is.

1125
01:41:35,654 --> 01:41:36,873
What do you think?

1126
01:41:37,700 --> 01:41:39,919
Are you and your
dad going to stay with us?

1127
01:41:45,229 --> 01:41:46,578
Don't know.

1128
01:41:46,665 --> 01:41:48,276
And he's not my dad.

1129
01:41:49,494 --> 01:41:50,365
Really?

1130
01:41:51,540 --> 01:41:53,672
Seemed like he
deeply cared for you.

1131
01:41:54,630 --> 01:41:57,546
Quite an
unusual thing around here.

1132
01:42:16,826 --> 01:42:18,958
Good morning, my friend.

1133
01:43:03,351 --> 01:43:05,440
Happy hunger seek.

1134
01:43:34,208 --> 01:43:36,122
We've got to keep them back.

1135
01:43:36,210 --> 01:43:36,949
Wait.

1136
01:43:37,036 --> 01:43:38,124
It's too late.

1137
01:43:46,742 --> 01:43:48,091
Take the
people down to the tunnel.

1138
01:43:48,178 --> 01:43:49,745
Let's see how
your plan B works.

1139
01:43:49,832 --> 01:43:51,790
Go find a higher position.

1140
01:43:51,877 --> 01:43:52,922
You stay here and cover them.

1141
01:43:53,009 --> 01:43:53,966
And you?

1142
01:43:55,098 --> 01:43:56,665
I'm going to go find Cassius.

1143
01:43:58,667 --> 01:43:59,798
Move! Move!

1144
01:43:59,885 --> 01:44:01,104
Move!

1145
01:44:01,191 --> 01:44:02,627
Move! Move!

1146
01:44:02,714 --> 01:44:03,933
Hey, hey, hey!

1147
01:44:04,020 --> 01:44:05,021
Have you seen
the girl who came with me?

1148
01:44:05,108 --> 01:44:06,718
No, no, give her to me.

1149
01:44:06,805 --> 01:44:07,589
Look, keep her safe.

1150
01:44:07,676 --> 01:44:09,068
I will, I promise.

1151
01:44:09,155 --> 01:44:11,201
Move, move, move, move!

1152
01:44:35,007 --> 01:44:36,487
I'm out.

1153
01:44:36,574 --> 01:44:38,359
Fuck, me too.

1154
01:44:39,447 --> 01:44:41,275
We can't hold them.

1155
01:44:41,362 --> 01:44:42,406
Everyone escape.

1156
01:44:42,493 --> 01:44:43,755
Use the tunnel.

1157
01:45:00,468 --> 01:45:01,338
Go to the bunker.

1158
01:45:03,949 --> 01:45:05,603
Where are you, old man?

1159
01:45:19,095 --> 01:45:20,314
Let's get out of here.

1160
01:45:21,576 --> 01:45:22,403
Thanks.

1161
01:45:23,708 --> 01:45:25,275
Go, move, move, move!

1162
01:45:51,562 --> 01:45:52,433
Look out!

1163
01:45:57,133 --> 01:45:58,352
Down!

1164
01:46:14,106 --> 01:46:15,107
We've got to go.

1165
01:46:15,194 --> 01:46:16,326
The whole shithole's
ready to blow.

1166
01:46:51,100 --> 01:46:53,450
What do you want from us?

1167
01:46:53,537 --> 01:46:57,236
You people just
can't accept your fate,

1168
01:46:57,323 --> 01:46:59,108
and the desperate are dangerous.

1169
01:47:03,939 --> 01:47:07,421
We'll soon be
together in a safer world.

1170
01:47:14,950 --> 01:47:16,691
No, no, no, no.

1171
01:47:28,572 --> 01:47:29,443
Ow.

1172
01:47:32,750 --> 01:47:34,056
Are you ready now?

1173
01:47:36,711 --> 01:47:37,581
No!

1174
01:47:37,668 --> 01:47:39,104
No! It can't be!

1175
01:47:39,931 --> 01:47:41,237
No!

1176
01:47:41,324 --> 01:47:42,238
No!

1177
01:47:42,325 --> 01:47:43,239
No!

1178
01:47:43,326 --> 01:47:44,240
No! No!

1179
01:47:59,821 --> 01:48:01,431
Fuck your evolution.

1180
01:48:14,139 --> 01:48:16,098
Just do it, man.

1181
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:42,994
Abigail. Come on!

1182
01:48:43,081 --> 01:48:44,561
Come on, let's go!

1183
01:48:44,648 --> 01:48:45,519
Go!

1184
01:48:48,173 --> 01:48:49,131
Come on, Abigail.

1185
01:48:49,218 --> 01:48:50,088
Move, move, move.

1186
01:48:50,175 --> 01:48:51,525
Go, go, go.

1187
01:48:57,313 --> 01:48:59,097
Not yet.

1188
01:48:59,184 --> 01:49:00,708
The girl hasn't come out yet.

1189
01:49:05,190 --> 01:49:06,496
There.

1190
01:49:09,238 --> 01:49:10,718
Five,

1191
01:49:10,805 --> 01:49:12,633
four.

1192
01:49:16,462 --> 01:49:18,639
Just do it, man.

1193
01:49:44,969 --> 01:49:46,057
Thank God.

1194
01:50:04,815 --> 01:50:05,773
What?

1195
01:50:08,602 --> 01:50:09,777
It's nothing.

1196
01:50:09,864 --> 01:50:10,691
OK.

1197
01:50:11,387 --> 01:50:12,867
Take it easy.

1198
01:50:12,954 --> 01:50:13,781
All right?

1199
01:50:14,564 --> 01:50:15,826
Don't move.

1200
01:50:15,913 --> 01:50:16,914
Don't even think about it?

1201
01:50:17,001 --> 01:50:17,915
- OK.
- Don't move.

1202
01:50:18,002 --> 01:50:18,916
All right.

1203
01:50:19,003 --> 01:50:19,961
All right.

1204
01:50:20,048 --> 01:50:20,918
OK?

1205
01:50:22,050 --> 01:50:23,007
Just lower your weapon, OK?

1206
01:50:23,094 --> 01:50:24,008
The sword.

1207
01:50:29,753 --> 01:50:30,711
- Lower your weapon.--
- I'm fine.

1208
01:50:30,798 --> 01:50:32,016
OK.

1209
01:50:32,103 --> 01:50:33,235
All right.

1210
01:52:50,938 --> 01:52:53,505
And what do we do now?

1211
01:52:58,641 --> 01:53:00,774
A new home is waiting for us.
