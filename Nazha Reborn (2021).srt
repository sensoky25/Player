1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000

3
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:53,625
Ladies and gentlemen.

4
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:56,583
Get ready and hold your breath.

5
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:58,416
Here we go!

6
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,500
Ride the wind!

7
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:04,083
Some roads lead into the fire.

8
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:06,250
Some roads lead into the sea.

9
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,666
Some roads lead into the light.

10
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,833
Some roads lead into a fight.

11
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:14,083
Some roads lead into your heart.

12
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:16,833
Some roads shake you.

13
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:19,416
Some roads take you

14
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:21,750
to the start.

15
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,791
Everyone has an identity.

16
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,541
In different times and places,

17
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:29,958
we all play different roles.

18
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:31,333
Are you crazy?

19
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:33,541
A student, worker,

20
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:35,750
father, daughter, and hero.

21
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:38,041
You have good luck!

22
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:39,375
My name's Li Yunxiang.

23
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:41,291
Right now, I'm a motorcycle racer.

24
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:44,625
The one who's about to win the race.

25
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:47,541
Not yet, though.

26
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:51,416
Each person finds their own place
Along the path

27
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,458
I'm still not the rider
Who has won your heart yet

28
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:56,208
My bike's roaring

29
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:57,375
The wind's soaring

30
00:01:57,458 --> 00:02:00,375
Blow away all the numb indifference
In this troubled world

31
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:02,000
God knows if I am

32
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:03,458
How I should be yet

33
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:04,500
I know I just

34
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,875
Can't stand the way you look at me

35
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:09,833
I risk my life finding myself
In chaos and speed

36
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:13,041
Only if I give it my all will I succeed

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,625
-That's amazing!
-That's amazing!

38
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,416
The competition just now was so exciting!

39
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:33,875
Hurry up!

40
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:35,916
Let us congratulate Li Yunxiang

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,125
for winning
the Underground Street Race again!

42
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:42,166
Thank you.

43
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,250
That was close,
but you managed to save yourself.

44
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:48,041
Li Yunxiang,
your condition today is not bad.

45
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:50,333
Show some respect.

46
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:51,916
Don't you know who I am?

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,500
I thought I was doomed. I have no idea
how the motorcycle flew across.

48
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,125
You didn't know,

49
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:59,875
but I was so anxious up there.

50
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,541
I know you want to impress her,

51
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,583
but there's no need to risk your life.

52
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:06,541
She is a tough competition.
I had to pull out a wild card.

53
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,375
Haven't you always liked her?

54
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:11,458
-Go talk to her then. This is typical.
-Get off.

55
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:12,708
What are you scared of?

56
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:20,000
GASOLINE

57
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:28,083
True, she is a bit older than me.

58
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,708
Soon,

59
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:32,291
you'll be calling her Aunt.

60
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:33,375
Cut it out.

61
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,333
You don't get it, silly girl.

62
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,541
You choose love over friendship.

63
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,041
I'm still standing here.

64
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,750
We met again.

65
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,125
That was extreme, right?

66
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,500
Great work on the motorcycle.

67
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,583
Hey, I still don't know your name.

68
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,625
You are upsetting your girlfriend.

69
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,333
-She is not--
-See you next time.

70
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:03,125
Let's do this again soon!

71
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,666
You are bad at flirting.

72
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:17,708
Hey, kid, your motorcycle looks good.
Help me with mine someday.

73
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,166
Why should I do that?

74
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,750
You are going? I run this place!

75
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:24,916
I live here!

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,750
Come hang out when you are free.

77
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,583
Make sure you modify my motorcycle!

78
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:34,541
THE NEW ORDER OF THE GODS
AROSE FROM CHAOS.

79
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:38,666
3,000 YEARS AGO,
HAVOC REIGNED AMONG GODS AND HUMANS.

80
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:43,041
THE GODS FOUGHT FOR SUPREMACY.

81
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:47,041
THE WORLD SETTLED
UNDER THE NEW CELESTIAL ORDER.

82
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,750
ANOTHER ERA OF CHAOS
AND CONFLICT BEGAN.

83
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,833
IN DONGHAI CITY,
AN UNEASY TRUCE REIGNED.

84
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,375
DE, LI, SONG, AND SHUN,
FOUR CLANS RULED.

85
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,541
AMONG THEM,
DE CLAN WAS THE MOST POWERFUL.

86
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:01,125
IN RECENT YEARS,
DONGHAI HAD RUN OUT OF WATER.

87
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,958
Water is gold.

88
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,083
Donghai has affections.

89
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:08,958
Donghai's De Group brings you water.

90
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,750
-We believe that De Group…
-Extra!

91
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,250
-Everyone must conserve water!
-…will create a better tomorrow.

92
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,166
-Crackdown on smugglers!
-Only half a pail left?

93
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,583
-Boss De invests widely in Donghai!
-Give me some.

94
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,333
Newsboy, give me a copy!

95
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:21,625
Your paper!

96
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,541
Extra! The water shortage worsens!

97
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,666
-Kid, give me a paper.
-Here.

98
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,083
Thank you, boss!
Extra! The water shortage worsens!

99
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,833
-The people are--
-Tiger.

100
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,333
Tell me, is there any money
in water speculation?

101
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,666
If I knew,
I wouldn't have to sell newspapers.

102
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,958
Get lost.

103
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,916
Crackdown on water smugglers!

104
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:44,500
Be careful, kid. It's a new dress.

105
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,541
Ms. San, you look so pretty.

106
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,791
You might catch the boss's eye

107
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,291
and go from crow to phoenix.

108
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,375
You little shit, so I'm a crow?

109
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,000
No, you are a phoenix.

110
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,125
Thank you, Ms. San.

111
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:58,458
-Extra! The water shortage worsens!
-Tiger, I'll take one.

112
00:05:58,541 --> 00:05:59,666
Here, catch!

113
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,458
Here.

114
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:03,708
Extra! Donghai…

115
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:04,916
-Be careful!
-Mrs. Liu.

116
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,583
-Mr. Cheng.
-Six.

117
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:09,666
You are back early.

118
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,666
Six!

119
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,458
-Thank you, Six!
-Do you know how to kick?

120
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,000
Six, good timing,

121
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:23,916
take this too.

122
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,958
Sure.

123
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:25,916
SPEEDY COURIERS

124
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,166
The four clans own this place.

125
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,375
Everyone knows their word is the law.

126
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:31,541
Imagine working for them.

127
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,000
Easy money and status too.

128
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,333
-Yunxiang, are you fixing it up?
-Not smuggling like us.

129
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,583
-I'm just adding in some bits.
-Six, give me a hand.

130
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,416
-I'm coming!
-Liang, I won't work for them.

131
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,166
-To the warehouse.
-Once outlaws come clean,

132
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,583
some die, and others run,
but it's always a bad ending.

133
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,458
You have to be given that chance first.

134
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,250
Have you seen those guys in the clans?

135
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:48,708
You see a dragon's head

136
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,458
and never see its tail.

137
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,000
That's just sour grapes.

138
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,416
Who would smuggle
if you could go the legal way?

139
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,791
What are you talking about?

140
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,583
We have nothing to do with the clans.

141
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,250
-Boss.
-We smuggle

142
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,625
-to survive in a waterless world.
-Yes.

143
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,166
Being able to put food on the table

144
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,416
is good enough.

145
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,666
-Right?
-Sure.

146
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,416
-That's if it is enough to survive.
-Come and get the goods.

147
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,291
-Get the goods.
-Take it up to Song territory.

148
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,375
Okay.

149
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,375
For you two.

150
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,166
Yunxiang, this is for you.

151
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,208
It's risky lately. Stay calm.

152
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,416
I'm off.

153
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,750
I've never been to other cities,

154
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:37,666
but I know

155
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,166
all cities are the same.

156
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,416
Just different people in different places.

157
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,916
In some places, it's so green
like each leaf was soaked in water.

158
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,958
But in other places…

159
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,708
Water!

160
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:56,833
Water!

161
00:07:58,416 --> 00:07:59,375
Come on, give me some.

162
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,666
Spare me some money.

163
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,791
That's it for today.

164
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,291
-Go home.
-Sir.

165
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,666
I have water coins.
Can't you give me a few drops?

166
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,708
What did I say?

167
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:11,875
Come back tomorrow.

168
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,666
It shouldn't be like this.

169
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,666
Yet it has always been this way.

170
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:23,958
-However, it's the only world we have.
-It has always been this kind of world

171
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:28,583
Same air

172
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,708
Different fates

173
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,458
Begin to feel

174
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:40,416
Don't live in this kind of world

175
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,208
DE WATER INDUSTRY

176
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,333
Starting today

177
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:54,083
We live in this kind of world

178
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,166
NO ENTRY

179
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,083
Over there!

180
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,666
Be who you are

181
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,625
-There's water!
-There's water!

182
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,250
Yunxiang, how did it go yesterday?

183
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,166
-They increased the patrols.
-We can't do this.

184
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,666
It's getting tougher all the time.

185
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,458
You want a decent living,

186
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,041
but there are no easy jobs.

187
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,250
-You have no choice.
-Where should I put this?

188
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,291
There's a kitten!

189
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,541
-A kitten?
-Six, where did it come from?

190
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,166
I'm not sure about it,
but there's a delivery address.

191
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,958
We should put a sign to tell people
we are a fake courier service.

192
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,750
Contraband only. That's it.

193
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,708
-Should we just throw it?
-Don't do that.

194
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:52,708
I'll deliver it.

195
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,458
Someone didn't want it,

196
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:05,416
so they gave a fake address
and threw it our way.

197
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,375
Handle it yourself.

198
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,833
Fake address.

199
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,583
Okay. You may go.

200
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,958
See, you don't need an owner.

201
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,708
There's no one bossing you around.
You are lucky!

202
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,791
It's a big world.

203
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,625
You'll be fine on your own.

204
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,875
Go. Hurry up and leave.

205
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:00,500
Sending a tiny cat,
like you, into the world

206
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,291
is indeed crazy.

207
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:08,875
PALACE OF HAPPINESS

208
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,333
PALACE OF HAPPINESS, NIGHTCLUB

209
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:18,416
Ms. San.

210
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,875
Such a big world

211
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,916
So many places

212
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,583
A free spirit like me

213
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:37,458
Could linger anywhere

214
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,708
Such a big world

215
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:43,500
So many young men

216
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,291
A free spirit like me

217
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,458
Could find love anywhere

218
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:52,458
There's a place

219
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:55,000
I cannot go

220
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,375
There's a young man

221
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,875
I can't even say hello to

222
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:04,125
That place is home

223
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,750
That man is you

224
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,750
But young man

225
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:13,083
What do you know?

226
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,625
Life and death go on

227
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,916
Flowers bloom and fade

228
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,791
But young man

229
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,125
Why are you hesitant?

230
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,125
Flowers will bloom again

231
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,125
Youth comes only once

232
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,250
But young man

233
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,666
Why are you hesitant?

234
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,375
But young man

235
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:52,875
What do you know?

236
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,125
Yunxiang, what are you doing here?

237
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,166
Why? Am I not allowed to come?

238
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,541
Don't mess up my hair.

239
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,375
Why is it a small crowd tonight?

240
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,875
Someone sabotaged the sluice gates.

241
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,041
They say that until he is found,

242
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,916
there will be no more water. So--

243
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,416
Is this for me?

244
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,208
-Yes.
-It's such a cute kitten!

245
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,958
What made you think of this?

246
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,041
Are you delivering again?

247
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,958
If Old Li finds out he will be pissed.

248
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,708
Only I can call him "Old Li."

249
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:34,708
Speaking of Old Li,

250
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,500
let's have dinner there tonight.

251
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,875
Last time, you had a fight
and said you wouldn't see him again.

252
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,875
-You are using me as an excuse.
-Cut it out!

253
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,791
-I'm driving.
-How will you thank me?

254
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:53,625
This building will do.

255
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,500
It's higher than
the second building by 20 stories.

256
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,125
Won't the other three clans

257
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,416
build a building too?

258
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,083
They are too busy
fighting with each other.

259
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,500
Their finances are a mess.

260
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:09,000
Dad says to keep the people in line.

261
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,958
You can't let them get too comfortable.

262
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,333
Full bellies

263
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,250
foster random thoughts.

264
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,833
-Donghai lacks water.
-Let's go.

265
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:20,208
-From lack comes the need.
-Okay.

266
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,125
Grasp what they need,

267
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,833
and you will rule over them.

268
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:27,541
-Your dad knows human nature.
-Okay.

269
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,250
Controlling the water

270
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,583
-means controlling Donghai.
-Follow us.

271
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,958
Nice motorcycle.

272
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,125
Nice car.

273
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,333
He's the third son
of the De Group's owner.

274
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,083
Really?

275
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,416
Sell him the motorcycle.

276
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,458
State your price,
our master will give it to you.

277
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,708
Old Li, it's us!

278
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:14,166
I'm back.

279
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,208
Kasha, you haven't visited in ages.

280
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:21,041
-Well, I'm here now.
-Look at you, calling him "Old Li."

281
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,208
Jinxiang, are you the cook tonight?

282
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,375
Forget it. You boys have a good chat.

283
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,500
I'll cook.

284
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,416
Jinxiang, why are you here today?

285
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
Anti-Smuggling Bureau
busted another smuggling ring.

286
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,125
I had to deliver the report.

287
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,500
The place was close by.

288
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,333
How have you been?

289
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,291
Is your courier job still going well?

290
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,666
-It's still the same.
-Hand me a Number 5 wrench.

291
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,583
Okay.

292
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,583
Yesterday someone broke
the sluice gates of the city.

293
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:54,750
Distribution has been halted

294
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,125
while authorities investigate.

295
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,666
Enough with the bad news.

296
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,041
The bastard is causing trouble
for all of us.

297
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,541
If I find him,

298
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,208
I will break his legs.

299
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,458
You can pour yours, Yunxiang.

300
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,541
Dad, a toast to you.

301
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,708
Amidst the chaos and taxes,

302
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,791
we are not rich, but not poor either.

303
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,041
In any case,

304
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:24,041
it's better to have a proper job.

305
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,208
-Here is the soup!
-All right.

306
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,375
Here, Dad.

307
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,125
Have some soup.

308
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,708
The bureau still has water
so I brought you two buckets.

309
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,750
Otherwise, there'd be
no dinner tonight.

310
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,875
The soup is delicious.

311
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:50,250
Our area is under De Clan.
We are in the best shape economically.

312
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,541
Elsewhere, it's chaos.

313
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,208
People are living precariously.

314
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:58,541
The De Clan is tough but meticulous.

315
00:16:58,625 --> 00:16:59,708
Life isn't easy,

316
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:02,250
but we make ends meet.

317
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,875
I'm not worried about you.

318
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,833
Shady business never ends well.

319
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,375
I've had enough.

320
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,708
Old Li is just worried about you.

321
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:45,750
Worried, my ass.

322
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:50,875
Cats have better lives.

323
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,208
They have no one to nag them.

324
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,833
You can live your own life.

325
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:56,791
Come on.

326
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,291
You have a dad and a brother.

327
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,416
I wish my folks were still alive

328
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,125
to nag me every day.

329
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,208
I won't mind if they scold me either.

330
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,208
Kasha is right.

331
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,750
You know what Dad is like.

332
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,666
The De Clan sent down orders

333
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,500
to clamp down hard on smuggling.

334
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,625
Be careful with the stuff you do.

335
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,208
You know that our bureau

336
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,208
practically works for them.

337
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,000
I'm off.

338
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,250
It can't last.

339
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:27,541
-Get out while you can.
-Goodbye, Jinxiang!

340
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,833
Someone is following us.

341
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:05,750
I like

342
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:06,916
this motorcycle.

343
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,583
I like it too.

344
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:14,250
Whatever it is that I like, I will get.

345
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:16,833
Not this time.

346
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,750
I'm not giving it to you.

347
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:29,916
Hold on tight.

348
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:14,833
Kasha--

349
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:16,958
Try and run now.

350
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:22,166
Do you think what's yours is yours?

351
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,875
As long as I want it,

352
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,625
it is mine.

353
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:30,625
Third Prince.

354
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:22,958
-Master.
-Let's go.

355
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,916
Yes, Boss.

356
00:22:56,916 --> 00:22:58,500
I think it's him.

357
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:01,666
I know.

358
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:04,708
It has been so many years.

359
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:14,791
Yes,

360
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:17,666
a wall of red flame.

361
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:25,458
If it's really him,

362
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:26,833
it's your son

363
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:29,083
who provoked him again.

364
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:34,583
Nurse, this medicine is spilled.

365
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:36,375
I'll change it for you right away.

366
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:42,750
-That patient is improving.
-Keep him under observation.

367
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:45,291
-Doctor, his fever is gone.
-Monitor him. I'll see him later.

368
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:46,750
Dr. Su, please sign here.

369
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:48,958
-Water's short. Use it sparingly.
-Okay.

370
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:50,708
Come, I'll give you an injection.

371
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,125
It's you.

372
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,875
Why are you--

373
00:23:57,625 --> 00:24:00,041
I'm Su Junzhu, a doctor here.

374
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:01,583
How did I get here?

375
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:03,833
A masked man brought you in last night.

376
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:05,000
I was on duty.

377
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,416
Don't move. You are badly injured--

378
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,000
How did it heal so quickly?

379
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:12,791
What is it?

380
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,250
Kasha!

381
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:29,500
Where is she?

382
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:59,291
When she arrived,
it was already too late to save her leg.

383
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,291
She is still not out of danger.

384
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:08,416
CIJI HOSPITAL

385
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:13,750
DE GROUP

386
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:16,583
DONGHAI AUDIT

387
00:25:16,666 --> 00:25:18,166
Why are you outside?

388
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,916
-You look okay.
-I am okay.

389
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,458
How's Kasha?

390
00:25:22,541 --> 00:25:23,666
Kasha…

391
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:32,000
The De Clan?

392
00:26:11,958 --> 00:26:13,333
Hey, that's…

393
00:26:13,416 --> 00:26:14,958
That's Boss De.

394
00:26:20,208 --> 00:26:23,458
I apologize on behalf of my son.

395
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:25,833
Young men can be wild.

396
00:26:25,916 --> 00:26:27,416
He has done wrong against you.

397
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,458
Please forgive him.

398
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:30,875
He has offended you.

399
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:34,541
We respectfully return your motorcycle.

400
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:38,666
Here's a small token of respect.

401
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,833
Kindly accept this gesture

402
00:26:40,916 --> 00:26:42,583
and let us move on.

403
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:43,875
Boss De,

404
00:26:43,958 --> 00:26:45,750
this is so--

405
00:26:51,666 --> 00:26:52,541
You--

406
00:26:52,625 --> 00:26:54,291
If you want to apologize,

407
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:55,708
give me your son's leg.

408
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:01,666
Boss De, I'm so sorry.

409
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,833
My little brother has a bad temper.

410
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:05,958
I'll try and talk to him.

411
00:27:15,291 --> 00:27:16,291
Boss,

412
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:17,875
is it really him?

413
00:27:17,958 --> 00:27:21,666
It might just be someone
with a superpower,

414
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,875
but it might also be him.

415
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:26,875
In every reincarnation,
it's the same story.

416
00:27:26,958 --> 00:27:28,208
But why?

417
00:27:29,208 --> 00:27:30,958
It's the Will of Heaven.

418
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:32,833
You can't fight it.

419
00:27:33,791 --> 00:27:36,958
It must play out, cycle after cycle.

420
00:27:37,541 --> 00:27:39,583
Before he is fully awakened,

421
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:41,333
let's get rid of him.

422
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:44,291
Just like the last few times.

423
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:46,041
The plan is in place.

424
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:47,958
They are onto him.

425
00:27:51,833 --> 00:27:54,916
Don't be like that.
Boss De is such a big man to be so polite.

426
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,541
Do you know what happened to Kasha's leg?

427
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,666
Yes, I know.

428
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,125
The doctor phoned me.

429
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:05,500
All that gold
could buy her the best treatment

430
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,250
and she will be set for life.

431
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:09,041
What can people like us do?

432
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:11,250
Donghai City is like that.
Why can't you accept reality?

433
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:12,625
It's because I can't!

434
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:15,458
It's up to you to accept
but think of Kasha.

435
00:28:15,541 --> 00:28:16,875
What about her future?

436
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:18,208
Also, it's all because--

437
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,625
-Jinxiang, hop on!
-Okay!

438
00:28:58,041 --> 00:28:59,416
Jinxiang, quick!

439
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:15,708
CLIFF! DANGER!

440
00:29:15,791 --> 00:29:17,083
The cliff!

441
00:29:38,916 --> 00:29:40,875
-Who are these monsters?
-Move!

442
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,166
Do it.

443
00:31:09,583 --> 00:31:10,625
Down!

444
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:27,500
I love the smell of grilled fish
in the morning.

445
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:30,291
Who are they? Who are you?

446
00:31:30,375 --> 00:31:32,166
Nezha, you are--

447
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:34,000
a scatterbrain.

448
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:35,916
What did you call me?

449
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:40,083
We know each other, Nezha.

450
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:45,208
Me calling him "Nezha"

451
00:31:45,291 --> 00:31:46,625
makes you excited, right?

452
00:31:46,708 --> 00:31:47,958
It must have shocked him.

453
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:52,000
See you later!

454
00:31:54,541 --> 00:31:56,291
Doctor! Dr. Su!

455
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:57,250
-Hurry!
-Hurry!

456
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:58,333
Take him to surgery!

457
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:01,583
Move!

458
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:03,208
Who are these monsters?

459
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:08,833
-Who are you?
-I live here, Nezha.

460
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:30,458
Our total defeat

461
00:32:30,541 --> 00:32:32,125
doesn't surprise me.

462
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:35,833
Dad, even if he has special powers,

463
00:32:35,916 --> 00:32:37,125
I started this,

464
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:38,666
so I should finish it.

465
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,083
You will, will you?

466
00:33:17,416 --> 00:33:19,208
Dad, he hurt you too?

467
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:22,750
Yes, he did.

468
00:33:23,541 --> 00:33:26,708
Me, the Dragon King of East Sea.

469
00:33:29,666 --> 00:33:31,916
It has been 3,000 years

470
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
and it's still not healed.

471
00:33:44,416 --> 00:33:46,541
He is crazy.

472
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:50,375
Full of magical powers and violence.

473
00:33:50,458 --> 00:33:53,041
He would kill both god and demon.

474
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:55,708
Gender and relations won't matter.

475
00:33:56,291 --> 00:33:59,708
He would even kill his own dad.

476
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,125
He is

477
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,333
Nezha.

478
00:34:41,791 --> 00:34:42,958
You came.

479
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:44,750
Why do you call me Nezha?

480
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,625
Because that's who you are.

481
00:34:46,708 --> 00:34:47,583
Let me ask you.

482
00:34:47,666 --> 00:34:51,458
When you were a kid, did your dad ever
tell the story of Nezha and Dragon King?

483
00:34:51,541 --> 00:34:52,791
Of course I know the story.

484
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:54,291
Well, you are that

485
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:55,375
chaos-creating,

486
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:56,583
sea-churning,

487
00:34:56,666 --> 00:34:58,958
insufferably arrogant Nezha!

488
00:34:59,958 --> 00:35:01,458
You are Nezha!

489
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:12,458
A bachelor has to do everything himself.

490
00:35:12,541 --> 00:35:13,833
What was I saying?

491
00:35:13,916 --> 00:35:15,666
-That I'm Nezha.
-Right.

492
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:16,791
Each reincarnation

493
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:18,625
means a new name and identity,

494
00:35:18,708 --> 00:35:20,041
parents, family, friends,

495
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:24,625
and all the normal mess of life.

496
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:25,958
Do you have a girlfriend?

497
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:28,000
Do you?

498
00:35:29,916 --> 00:35:31,750
Boss De is the Dragon King of East Sea.

499
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:35,250
His son, that little bastard is
the Dragon King's Third Prince, Ao Bing.

500
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:39,125
So in past lives, he killed me.

501
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:42,583
Your dad used all his powers

502
00:35:42,666 --> 00:35:45,916
to forge you a steel dragon spine

503
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,375
and bring you back to life.

504
00:35:49,333 --> 00:35:51,291
But the injury

505
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:53,458
wiped your memory of past lives.

506
00:35:56,083 --> 00:35:57,916
Three thousand years ago,

507
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,333
the four Dragon Kings
stopped fighting each other

508
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:06,833
so that united, we could make him
kill himself in the atonement.

509
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,666
Who knew that after his death,

510
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,708
his soul evaded Heaven's dragnet

511
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:15,125
and reincarnated again and again.

512
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:18,125
The one beside Li Jing in Heaven

513
00:36:18,208 --> 00:36:21,208
is just a clay effigy, a fake Nezha.

514
00:36:21,291 --> 00:36:22,750
The real Nezha

515
00:36:22,833 --> 00:36:24,083
has escaped.

516
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:26,500
So for 3,000 years,

517
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:28,625
we have kept an eye on Donghai.

518
00:36:28,708 --> 00:36:31,416
Anyone who appears
to be his reincarnation,

519
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,125
we will kill him.

520
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:37,458
It's better to kill in error
than take chances.

521
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:42,750
My luck is good today.
Let's drink this one.

522
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:48,916
The flames from my body

523
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
and that huge shadowy figure behind me.

524
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:53,500
They're all…

525
00:36:53,583 --> 00:36:55,250
That's his original god-body.

526
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:57,458
You are Nezha reborn, my dear brother!

527
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:00,791
Cut it out. Come drink.

528
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:05,250
Nezha was born with that fire

529
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:06,583
hardcore, tough as steel.

530
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:08,500
But once released…

531
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:09,541
My goodness.

532
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:11,666
Not even you can control it.

533
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,875
See?

534
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,833
That fire of his scares even me.

535
00:37:18,916 --> 00:37:21,291
If I'm Nezha, who are you then?

536
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:22,458
Me?

537
00:37:23,125 --> 00:37:26,666
I'm not going to tell you.

538
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,541
This time his awakening is more powerful.

539
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,708
Don't provoke him.

540
00:37:35,583 --> 00:37:37,166
If I don't take revenge,

541
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,000
I'm not Dragon King's Third Prince!

542
00:37:42,833 --> 00:37:44,041
Shut up.

543
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:03,625
Leave.

544
00:38:03,708 --> 00:38:04,666
I--

545
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:14,708
My Dragon Pearl is still powering up.

546
00:38:14,791 --> 00:38:16,333
It's not time yet.

547
00:38:17,083 --> 00:38:19,416
I'll hire someone

548
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,166
to take him out.

549
00:38:23,541 --> 00:38:25,333
The pillars of the Heavens

550
00:38:25,833 --> 00:38:27,666
are collapsing.

551
00:38:28,916 --> 00:38:34,083
-The world is falling apart.
-"My god-body"? "Uncontrollable"?

552
00:38:34,166 --> 00:38:35,125
Who is he kidding?

553
00:39:01,666 --> 00:39:03,000
You want someone killed?

554
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:05,416
Old pal,

555
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,583
you have worked for me before.

556
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:10,375
Don't act so surprised.

557
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,125
This fish looks familiar.

558
00:39:15,208 --> 00:39:17,458
It's cooked now. Have some.

559
00:39:17,541 --> 00:39:19,458
You were there.

560
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:21,916
Sure, I was passing by.

561
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,166
He is just a kid.

562
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:26,041
What's the big deal?

563
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:29,583
Besides, you have plenty of men

564
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:31,125
and I'm expensive.

565
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:36,375
He is Nezha.

566
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:40,791
Ao Guang.

567
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:44,333
You really have a problem.

568
00:39:47,416 --> 00:39:49,833
You couldn't tell he was Nezha?

569
00:39:50,416 --> 00:39:54,333
There are others who use fire too.
For example, the Fire Imp.

570
00:39:55,541 --> 00:39:58,333
But if it's really that killer, Nezha,

571
00:39:58,416 --> 00:40:00,708
I'm no match for him.

572
00:40:02,708 --> 00:40:06,041
You concealed your identity and powers.

573
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:10,166
You have plenty of tricks up your sleeve.

574
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:12,666
Yaksa, you know a lot of things.

575
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:14,833
But if you know so much,

576
00:40:14,916 --> 00:40:18,041
why do you always get beaten up?

577
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,708
We all have our roles.

578
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,083
Mine is to get beaten up,

579
00:40:23,166 --> 00:40:24,791
yours is to hide.

580
00:40:25,416 --> 00:40:26,416
Still,

581
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,916
if your enemy comes knocking,

582
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,291
you can turn yourself into a rat,

583
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:33,083
but they will still find you.

584
00:40:33,166 --> 00:40:34,708
A rat…

585
00:40:35,708 --> 00:40:36,625
Good idea!

586
00:40:37,375 --> 00:40:38,875
A rat!

587
00:40:40,208 --> 00:40:41,625
You know,

588
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:44,875
the old Order of the Gods is meaningless.

589
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:49,083
A new one will arise sooner or later.

590
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:52,333
Then, the Chan and Jie factions

591
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:56,333
will battle to death once again.

592
00:40:57,041 --> 00:40:59,375
No one gets to keep their hands clean.

593
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:02,833
Where will you hide then?

594
00:41:04,208 --> 00:41:05,708
Help me now

595
00:41:05,791 --> 00:41:08,833
and we will look after you then.

596
00:41:11,625 --> 00:41:13,708
Goodbye, old pal.

597
00:41:19,791 --> 00:41:21,125
Will he do it?

598
00:41:21,916 --> 00:41:25,875
He always agrees if the price is right.

599
00:41:27,083 --> 00:41:29,125
These demons

600
00:41:29,208 --> 00:41:31,875
are only after profits.

601
00:41:32,583 --> 00:41:34,083
Be patient.

602
00:41:38,416 --> 00:41:39,708
Don't worry. He is in here.

603
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,958
-I--
-Get out.

604
00:42:30,708 --> 00:42:31,833
-Father--
-Admit you're wrong!

605
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:33,625
-It's not my fault!
-You are a bad seed!

606
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,375
Fire!

607
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,583
-Fire!
-Bring the fire extinguisher!

608
00:42:42,666 --> 00:42:43,541
-Hurry!
-Hurry!

609
00:42:43,625 --> 00:42:45,458
Call for help to put out the fire!

610
00:42:46,708 --> 00:42:48,375
Dr. Su, there's a fire down here.

611
00:42:48,875 --> 00:42:49,958
Over there!

612
00:43:03,833 --> 00:43:04,750
Hey!

613
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:08,000
Will you be my teacher?

614
00:43:12,708 --> 00:43:13,833
Hey!

615
00:43:15,833 --> 00:43:17,291
No.

616
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:24,583
Don't you want me
to modify a motorcycle for you?

617
00:43:25,666 --> 00:43:27,041
I'll help you.

618
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:30,625
Just teach me how to control the fire.

619
00:43:32,208 --> 00:43:33,916
A motorcycle cooler than yours?

620
00:43:35,916 --> 00:43:37,083
It's not a problem.

621
00:43:39,208 --> 00:43:42,291
Okay, but you might not
be able to learn it.

622
00:43:42,375 --> 00:43:43,500
I'm telling you now.

623
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:46,333
Either way,
you have to modify my motorcycle.

624
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,166
Let me try.

625
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:49,708
Let's go.

626
00:43:53,125 --> 00:43:54,208
You were born

627
00:43:54,291 --> 00:43:55,958
with an internal god-fire.

628
00:43:57,708 --> 00:43:59,750
But you are just flesh and blood now.

629
00:43:59,833 --> 00:44:02,000
The fire is too fierce.

630
00:44:02,083 --> 00:44:04,041
So you need some iron

631
00:44:04,125 --> 00:44:05,583
to channel it outwards.

632
00:44:07,125 --> 00:44:08,041
Put out the fire.

633
00:44:08,666 --> 00:44:10,541
What will happen if I don't?

634
00:44:10,625 --> 00:44:11,875
If you don't--

635
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,041
It will burn the heart

636
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:15,666
and split the skin.

637
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:19,083
Your body dies and your spirit flies away.

638
00:44:22,625 --> 00:44:25,458
So you need a suit of armor

639
00:44:25,541 --> 00:44:27,916
to direct your internal fire.

640
00:44:32,041 --> 00:44:34,666
Once you master True Fire,

641
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:37,458
you can survive in both sea and air.

642
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:39,000
Are you sure about this?

643
00:45:08,666 --> 00:45:10,958
You have to maintain your focus.

644
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,958
Don't let the fire control you.

645
00:45:24,583 --> 00:45:25,625
I'm sorry.

646
00:45:46,166 --> 00:45:47,083
What?

647
00:45:47,166 --> 00:45:48,333
Keep going!

648
00:46:24,083 --> 00:46:25,125
Come on.

649
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:33,208
YUN

650
00:47:44,041 --> 00:47:45,208
That was fun!

651
00:47:46,583 --> 00:47:47,625
That was fun!

652
00:47:52,166 --> 00:47:53,250
Who are you really?

653
00:47:54,875 --> 00:47:56,000
I am

654
00:47:56,875 --> 00:47:58,291
Six-Ears Macaque.

655
00:48:00,041 --> 00:48:01,500
Six-Ears Macaque?

656
00:48:01,583 --> 00:48:03,708
In the legends, he tricks people.

657
00:48:03,791 --> 00:48:05,000
He is not a good person.

658
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,708
How are you qualified to say that to me?

659
00:48:08,791 --> 00:48:11,541
How much harm have you caused?

660
00:48:11,625 --> 00:48:12,666
How many disasters?

661
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:14,250
How many deaths?

662
00:48:14,333 --> 00:48:16,916
How many of your friends
and family got hurt?

663
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,208
You are the bad one, Nezha.

664
00:48:19,291 --> 00:48:20,958
Who are you talking about?

665
00:48:29,958 --> 00:48:32,000
It has been a long time, Nezha.

666
00:48:36,625 --> 00:48:39,708
You still have a lousy temper.

667
00:48:50,916 --> 00:48:52,291
Why can't I get him back?

668
00:48:52,791 --> 00:48:56,166
You're not yet united
with Nezha's god-body.

669
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:00,291
So naturally, you can't just call him up.

670
00:49:00,375 --> 00:49:01,750
"United"?

671
00:49:03,208 --> 00:49:04,083
Listen.

672
00:49:04,166 --> 00:49:07,000
Nezha was reborn as you, Li Yunxiang.

673
00:49:07,083 --> 00:49:09,875
But he has been reborn many times

674
00:49:09,958 --> 00:49:11,958
and will be back many more times.

675
00:49:12,041 --> 00:49:13,958
Zhang Yunxiang, Zhao Yunxiang,

676
00:49:14,041 --> 00:49:15,708
Wang Yunxiang, Sun Yunxiang…

677
00:49:15,791 --> 00:49:17,666
But until now,

678
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:19,625
there has been no reincarnation

679
00:49:19,708 --> 00:49:21,750
that's worthy of his name.

680
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:25,166
Some of them
didn't even realize they were Nezha

681
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:26,708
as their life went past.

682
00:49:26,791 --> 00:49:29,000
They weren't up to it
and weren't Nezha enough.

683
00:49:30,166 --> 00:49:31,375
Also,

684
00:49:31,458 --> 00:49:35,166
if you want Nezha's full powers
you have to get back your Astras.

685
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:36,333
Astras?

686
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
What Astras?

687
00:49:38,083 --> 00:49:41,250
Jinxiang. It's the Sky Ribbon
and Cosmic Ring.

688
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:44,166
This armor

689
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:45,958
is a bit slapdash.

690
00:49:46,041 --> 00:49:47,083
Keep at it.

691
00:49:47,166 --> 00:49:52,708
SPEEDY COURIERS

692
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:59,208
Your dad has arranged everything.

693
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:01,208
He is a clever strategist.

694
00:50:01,291 --> 00:50:03,916
We don't move until the time is ripe

695
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,833
so that there are no slip-ups.

696
00:50:05,916 --> 00:50:08,666
We will take whatever help we can get.

697
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:13,375
I want my revenge now.

698
00:50:14,166 --> 00:50:17,041
Third Prince, if we need to attack,

699
00:50:17,125 --> 00:50:18,458
leave it to me.

700
00:50:19,125 --> 00:50:21,791
After all, one of the Nezhas

701
00:50:21,875 --> 00:50:23,750
was killed by my hands.

702
00:50:25,666 --> 00:50:28,083
Yunxiang, that's so cool.

703
00:50:29,291 --> 00:50:30,625
-Let me see.
-What a poser.

704
00:50:30,708 --> 00:50:31,625
Li Yunxiang.

705
00:50:32,833 --> 00:50:34,375
Dr. Su, what brings you here?

706
00:50:34,958 --> 00:50:37,625
I've come to tell you
your brother's on the mend.

707
00:50:37,708 --> 00:50:40,416
-You should visit him.
-That's great! Thank you.

708
00:50:40,916 --> 00:50:42,041
I'll leave now.

709
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:43,208
By the way,

710
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:45,958
could you fix up my motorcycle one day?

711
00:50:46,708 --> 00:50:48,625
I'll never win against you then.

712
00:50:49,916 --> 00:50:51,125
Is that so important?

713
00:50:53,291 --> 00:50:54,541
-I can't tell.
-Exactly.

714
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:56,916
-Who is she?
-Watch out!

715
00:51:20,041 --> 00:51:21,166
Yunxiang!

716
00:51:29,458 --> 00:51:30,458
Six!

717
00:51:31,291 --> 00:51:32,333
Bastard.

718
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:45,500
It's just a pile of scrap iron.

719
00:51:52,625 --> 00:51:54,208
Scrap iron or not,

720
00:51:54,291 --> 00:51:55,375
I'll kill you!

721
00:52:53,583 --> 00:52:54,583
Li Yunxiang!

722
00:53:02,458 --> 00:53:03,583
Get lost!

723
00:53:13,125 --> 00:53:14,833
So, Third Prince,

724
00:53:14,916 --> 00:53:16,666
I wanted to see you.

725
00:53:17,583 --> 00:53:19,291
I was once young and naive.

726
00:53:19,375 --> 00:53:21,375
I thought if I worked hard at smuggling,

727
00:53:21,458 --> 00:53:23,833
I would make something of myself.

728
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,625
I was duped.

729
00:53:27,708 --> 00:53:28,916
-Duped?
-Well,

730
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,833
who knew that brat Li Yunxiang
was hiding so much?

731
00:53:31,916 --> 00:53:33,416
It turns out he is a big shot.

732
00:53:35,166 --> 00:53:37,708
He is a hero. But what about me?

733
00:53:38,583 --> 00:53:39,958
My business was ruined.

734
00:53:43,416 --> 00:53:44,583
The real thing.

735
00:53:49,666 --> 00:53:52,375
You know what you need to do, right?

736
00:53:52,458 --> 00:53:55,958
Third Prince, I'm smart and diligent.

737
00:53:56,041 --> 00:53:57,833
All I lacked was starting capital.

738
00:53:57,916 --> 00:54:00,041
If my dad was rich,

739
00:54:00,125 --> 00:54:01,416
I would be like you.

740
00:54:02,208 --> 00:54:03,583
I have money,

741
00:54:03,666 --> 00:54:05,041
but what's your life worth?

742
00:54:06,708 --> 00:54:08,666
Being a traitor doesn't worry you?

743
00:54:10,375 --> 00:54:12,000
What's a traitor who succeeds?

744
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:14,333
A successful man.

745
00:54:17,708 --> 00:54:19,041
You can just wait and see.

746
00:54:19,666 --> 00:54:21,458
That thing that appears behind him,

747
00:54:21,541 --> 00:54:23,208
maybe I have one too.

748
00:54:50,208 --> 00:54:52,041
Your dad's with your brother.

749
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:54,500
You should go and see him.
I'll keep watch here.

750
00:55:02,791 --> 00:55:05,500
There were so many wars then.

751
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:07,916
We were fleeing from them…

752
00:55:09,916 --> 00:55:11,541
when your mom got sick

753
00:55:11,625 --> 00:55:13,625
and died.

754
00:55:14,416 --> 00:55:16,125
I had a shoulder pole

755
00:55:16,791 --> 00:55:19,083
with you in the front basket

756
00:55:19,166 --> 00:55:22,041
and your younger brother in the other.

757
00:55:23,166 --> 00:55:25,583
The night was dark, the hill was steep,

758
00:55:26,083 --> 00:55:27,500
and the baskets were heavy.

759
00:55:29,291 --> 00:55:31,666
I tripped and rolled down the hill.

760
00:55:32,166 --> 00:55:34,208
I was so scared.

761
00:55:34,291 --> 00:55:37,291
I scrambled back to the baskets

762
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:39,041
and saw

763
00:55:39,125 --> 00:55:41,500
your brother laughing

764
00:55:41,583 --> 00:55:43,500
with such joy.

765
00:55:44,791 --> 00:55:46,791
He thought it was fun.

766
00:55:53,333 --> 00:55:55,833
The years have passed

767
00:55:56,916 --> 00:55:58,291
so quickly.

768
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:04,500
Your brother was always causing trouble.

769
00:56:05,416 --> 00:56:08,041
I thought that when he grew up,

770
00:56:08,125 --> 00:56:11,291
he would be more sensible.

771
00:56:11,375 --> 00:56:14,625
I didn't expect him
to cause bigger troubles.

772
00:56:16,625 --> 00:56:18,291
Now you too…

773
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,333
Your friends are all out of danger.

774
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,125
You can relax.

775
00:56:47,541 --> 00:56:49,458
I have always wanted to be a doctor.

776
00:56:50,166 --> 00:56:52,000
Because I thought

777
00:56:52,083 --> 00:56:54,041
I could help a lot of people that way.

778
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:57,666
I thought I could do that.

779
00:57:01,333 --> 00:57:02,625
Later, I realized

780
00:57:03,666 --> 00:57:06,208
a doctor can't help everyone.

781
00:57:07,375 --> 00:57:09,833
However, you can.

782
00:57:09,916 --> 00:57:10,875
Me?

783
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:14,916
I bring nothing but trouble.

784
00:57:19,166 --> 00:57:20,625
Don't blame yourself.

785
00:57:21,541 --> 00:57:23,333
It wasn't you who hurt them.

786
00:57:26,666 --> 00:57:28,458
But it was because of me.

787
00:57:29,958 --> 00:57:30,875
You know,

788
00:57:32,166 --> 00:57:33,916
the first time I saw you,

789
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,750
I knew you were different.

790
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:40,375
Cheer up.

791
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:43,166
What I saw just now

792
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:45,083
was a hero with a body of flame

793
00:57:45,166 --> 00:57:46,916
and boundless powers.

794
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,458
-Kasha!
-Kasha.

795
00:57:52,541 --> 00:57:55,666
-You need to be careful.
-I'm fine, I want to walk by myself.

796
00:58:48,125 --> 00:58:49,041
You…

797
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:50,541
What are you doing?

798
00:58:50,625 --> 00:58:51,750
Six.

799
00:58:51,833 --> 00:58:53,000
Keep quiet.

800
00:58:53,083 --> 00:58:55,708
-You'll wake people up.
-Let me go!

801
00:58:56,166 --> 00:58:57,041
Who's that?

802
00:59:14,541 --> 00:59:15,541
Help!

803
00:59:16,666 --> 00:59:17,708
There's a murderer!

804
00:59:19,583 --> 00:59:20,666
Help!

805
01:00:04,458 --> 01:00:06,208
Come on! This way! Come!

806
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:54,625
Kid!

807
01:00:55,791 --> 01:00:59,125
Stop it!

808
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:10,500
Help!

809
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:12,625
-Run!
-Help!

810
01:02:17,916 --> 01:02:20,000
Pay your blood debt with your life,

811
01:02:20,083 --> 01:02:20,916
Nezha.

812
01:02:46,791 --> 01:02:47,875
There's someone here.

813
01:02:48,375 --> 01:02:50,125
-Bear with it.
-Let's go over there.

814
01:02:50,208 --> 01:02:51,458
-Bear with it.
-I can't.

815
01:02:51,541 --> 01:02:53,250
-Don't move.
-Your wound will tear.

816
01:02:53,333 --> 01:02:54,708
Li Yunxiang, hurry!

817
01:02:54,791 --> 01:02:55,666
Your dad, he…

818
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:07,083
Old Li!

819
01:03:07,875 --> 01:03:08,791
Old Li!

820
01:03:09,666 --> 01:03:10,666
Doctor.

821
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:12,541
Doctor, hurry up and save him!

822
01:03:12,625 --> 01:03:13,833
Hurry up and save him!

823
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:17,083
Aren't you a doctor?

824
01:03:20,875 --> 01:03:22,458
Why can't you save him?

825
01:03:23,541 --> 01:03:24,791
Why?

826
01:03:26,958 --> 01:03:27,916
Yunxiang.

827
01:03:31,208 --> 01:03:34,958
Whatever trouble
you get into in the future,

828
01:03:36,291 --> 01:03:39,416
I won't nag you over it anymore.

829
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:41,625
Don't worry, we are in the hospital.

830
01:03:42,375 --> 01:03:43,625
You'll be okay.

831
01:03:44,416 --> 01:03:45,833
I always knew

832
01:03:47,375 --> 01:03:49,250
I had

833
01:03:50,416 --> 01:03:52,375
an amazing son.

834
01:03:53,583 --> 01:03:54,708
Stop talking,

835
01:03:55,541 --> 01:03:57,041
it will be okay.

836
01:03:57,125 --> 01:03:58,291
You,

837
01:03:58,958 --> 01:04:01,041
together with your friends,

838
01:04:02,333 --> 01:04:03,500
your brother,

839
01:04:05,541 --> 01:04:06,958
and yourself…

840
01:04:09,666 --> 01:04:10,708
Don't talk.

841
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:13,541
Old Li, don't talk.

842
01:04:13,625 --> 01:04:15,458
Keep living well,

843
01:04:16,208 --> 01:04:18,833
for everyone's sake.

844
01:04:19,666 --> 01:04:20,875
Live…

845
01:04:32,083 --> 01:04:33,583
Dad!

846
01:04:36,083 --> 01:04:37,375
Dad!

847
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,291
Dad!

848
01:05:02,916 --> 01:05:03,958
Where are you going?

849
01:05:04,041 --> 01:05:05,291
I'm going to kill them!

850
01:05:13,041 --> 01:05:15,000
There are still so many of you.

851
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:21,750
What a warm welcome.

852
01:05:27,708 --> 01:05:29,083
Disgusting!

853
01:05:29,166 --> 01:05:30,166
Let me see.

854
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:31,541
Dead Man's Hand.

855
01:05:31,625 --> 01:05:33,458
Use the joker, dumbass.

856
01:05:42,916 --> 01:05:44,791
Take a good look.

857
01:05:55,916 --> 01:05:57,083
I'm underdressed.

858
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:22,375
How powerful are these beasts of mine?

859
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:24,833
Now I get it.

860
01:06:24,916 --> 01:06:27,375
Donghai's water vanished in a blink

861
01:06:27,458 --> 01:06:30,083
on account of these two guys.

862
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:36,250
That's because I have their pup.

863
01:06:39,416 --> 01:06:41,875
They don't dare disobey.

864
01:06:45,791 --> 01:06:47,375
The surging East Sea

865
01:06:47,458 --> 01:06:51,166
draws on countless rivers,

866
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:54,416
taking in even the narrowest streams.

867
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:56,291
That's how it grows.

868
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:58,541
Brilliant.

869
01:06:58,625 --> 01:06:59,916
So brilliant.

870
01:07:01,041 --> 01:07:02,625
I asked you to my humble home

871
01:07:02,708 --> 01:07:06,041
to ask about the progress of that favor.

872
01:07:07,041 --> 01:07:09,666
I've been busy, but I'm onto it.

873
01:07:10,916 --> 01:07:12,041
Really?

874
01:07:12,125 --> 01:07:15,083
I'm very curious about one thing.

875
01:07:15,166 --> 01:07:17,041
That brat has advanced so quickly

876
01:07:17,125 --> 01:07:18,875
that he even beat Yaksa.

877
01:07:19,916 --> 01:07:22,958
I wonder who trained him.

878
01:07:23,041 --> 01:07:27,083
Maybe his internal fire was so strong,
it just came naturally.

879
01:07:27,166 --> 01:07:28,125
Maybe.

880
01:07:30,375 --> 01:07:32,333
But maybe you taught him.

881
01:07:32,416 --> 01:07:33,666
Me?

882
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:35,083
Why would I do that?

883
01:07:35,166 --> 01:07:37,208
-Impossible.
-Anything is possible.

884
01:07:37,291 --> 01:07:38,208
For instance,

885
01:07:38,291 --> 01:07:41,125
you fear I'll reveal your identity.

886
01:07:41,625 --> 01:07:44,375
So you want him to kill me

887
01:07:44,458 --> 01:07:46,208
and seal my lips.

888
01:07:49,916 --> 01:07:51,333
Six-Ears Macaque.

889
01:07:58,083 --> 01:08:00,000
It really is you, you demon.

890
01:08:00,083 --> 01:08:03,291
So Monkey King didn't really kill you.

891
01:08:04,166 --> 01:08:05,500
He really did.

892
01:08:06,041 --> 01:08:09,708
Now I'm just a nameless demon with a mask.

893
01:08:10,291 --> 01:08:11,375
Dragon King,

894
01:08:11,458 --> 01:08:14,583
these last few years,
Donghai's fresh water sources dried up.

895
01:08:14,666 --> 01:08:17,291
The river dragons in charge disappeared.

896
01:08:17,375 --> 01:08:18,750
What funny business…

897
01:08:18,833 --> 01:08:20,125
Six-Ears Macaque,

898
01:08:20,208 --> 01:08:21,958
those six ears

899
01:08:22,541 --> 01:08:25,250
really don't miss a single piece of news.

900
01:08:26,083 --> 01:08:28,208
There will be a new Order of the Gods!

901
01:08:28,291 --> 01:08:29,708
The Dragon Clan of East Sea

902
01:08:29,791 --> 01:08:33,166
won't have its tail trod on again
and be at the bottom of the Order.

903
01:08:33,833 --> 01:08:36,541
I need all that fresh water

904
01:08:36,625 --> 01:08:38,666
to enhance my powers

905
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:42,625
and rule the new Order of the Gods.

906
01:08:42,708 --> 01:08:44,625
The Order of the Gods…

907
01:08:44,708 --> 01:08:46,000
That old nonsense.

908
01:08:46,083 --> 01:08:48,083
You have brought such suffering

909
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:49,750
to the people of Donghai.

910
01:08:49,833 --> 01:08:51,041
Ao Guang.

911
01:08:51,125 --> 01:08:53,583
What if they sue you in Heaven's Court?

912
01:08:54,458 --> 01:08:56,333
It's chaos up there right now.

913
01:08:56,416 --> 01:08:58,125
No one has the time for it.

914
01:08:58,208 --> 01:09:00,875
Besides, who would take me to court?

915
01:09:01,458 --> 01:09:02,958
People are like grass.

916
01:09:03,041 --> 01:09:05,333
They need to be pruned well.

917
01:09:05,416 --> 01:09:08,416
If grass won't bend in the wind,

918
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:11,791
I will mow it down.

919
01:09:12,375 --> 01:09:13,958
You're impressive and harsh!

920
01:09:14,041 --> 01:09:15,250
I'm not harsh.

921
01:09:15,333 --> 01:09:17,541
Why are they fighting for position?

922
01:09:17,625 --> 01:09:18,875
Fighting for position?

923
01:09:32,708 --> 01:09:35,041
So she is now working for you too.

924
01:09:35,125 --> 01:09:39,000
Nezha has enemies
well beyond the East Sea clans.

925
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:21,208
Don't you see?
Even the red ribbons can't hold him.

926
01:10:51,666 --> 01:10:54,208
In the absence of the Dragon Pearl,

927
01:10:54,291 --> 01:10:56,416
we will retreat for now.

928
01:10:57,125 --> 01:10:58,291
Let's go.

929
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:04,125
Useless.

930
01:11:14,958 --> 01:11:16,250
Dad.

931
01:11:17,583 --> 01:11:19,083
I…

932
01:11:20,291 --> 01:11:21,708
I'll stop him.

933
01:11:29,083 --> 01:11:30,166
My son,

934
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:32,416
don't make me lose face.

935
01:11:36,916 --> 01:11:38,208
Nezha.

936
01:11:38,291 --> 01:11:39,541
This time,

937
01:11:39,625 --> 01:11:42,250
I won't humiliate myself
like I did in my past life.

938
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:45,250
Come on.

939
01:11:45,333 --> 01:11:47,041
This will be a fight to the death.

940
01:11:47,125 --> 01:11:49,666
I won't back off.

941
01:11:50,875 --> 01:11:52,750
Prepare to die!

942
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:28,083
Die!

943
01:14:41,166 --> 01:14:43,166
Ms. Cai Yun,

944
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:45,375
ambushes aren't nice.

945
01:14:45,458 --> 01:14:46,375
Wait.

946
01:14:47,958 --> 01:14:50,166
-Are you talking to me?
-Who is she?

947
01:14:50,250 --> 01:14:52,625
Her? A disciple of Demoness Shiji.

948
01:14:52,708 --> 01:14:54,333
You are the kiss of death.

949
01:14:54,416 --> 01:14:56,250
You bring disaster wherever you go.

950
01:14:56,333 --> 01:14:59,166
-Disaster?
-You arrogant piece of work.

951
01:14:59,250 --> 01:15:01,500
Playing with your master's bow and arrow,

952
01:15:01,583 --> 01:15:06,666
you killed my sister-in-arms
from 1,000 miles away.

953
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:08,875
You ripped out Third Prince's Dragon Spine

954
01:15:08,958 --> 01:15:12,250
and harmed Chentong's innocent people.

955
01:15:12,333 --> 01:15:14,083
Whatever incarnation you take,

956
01:15:14,166 --> 01:15:16,250
you hurt those closest to you.

957
01:15:16,333 --> 01:15:20,166
-You are the kiss of death.
-Nezha, you killed my son!

958
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:23,083
I'll drown everyone in the town!

959
01:15:23,166 --> 01:15:26,458
Father, where are my Astras?
Where did you hide them?

960
01:15:26,541 --> 01:15:28,750
Apologize, Nezha!

961
01:15:28,833 --> 01:15:30,375
Give me back my Astras!

962
01:15:30,458 --> 01:15:33,791
-You are a bad seed!
-Nezha, you are a villain.

963
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:35,625
-Apologize!
-Apologize!

964
01:15:36,458 --> 01:15:37,625
-Apologize!
-Apologize!

965
01:15:38,375 --> 01:15:39,833
-Apologize!
-Apologize!

966
01:15:40,666 --> 01:15:41,875
-Apologize!
-Apologize!

967
01:15:42,791 --> 01:15:47,041
-Apologize!
-If you don't, everyone will die!

968
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:49,333
My son, stop it!

969
01:15:49,416 --> 01:15:50,666
It's not my fault!

970
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:52,500
He needs to apologize!

971
01:15:52,583 --> 01:15:53,666
You!

972
01:15:54,625 --> 01:15:57,833
You are a bad seed.

973
01:16:09,291 --> 01:16:10,541
Dragon King,

974
01:16:12,291 --> 01:16:14,625
do you want me to apologize?

975
01:16:32,083 --> 01:16:33,666
-Go.
-What?

976
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:37,500
Let her go.

977
01:16:40,291 --> 01:16:41,750
Go.

978
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:43,958
He is letting you go.

979
01:16:45,708 --> 01:16:47,750
You will always be the kiss of death.

980
01:16:47,833 --> 01:16:49,500
Nothing can change that.

981
01:16:56,625 --> 01:16:58,125
If I'm the kiss of death,

982
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:01,375
why are you helping me?

983
01:17:01,458 --> 01:17:03,250
I'm not helping you.

984
01:17:03,791 --> 01:17:05,708
I'm helping your ancestor.

985
01:17:06,541 --> 01:17:07,583
Nezha.

986
01:17:07,666 --> 01:17:11,250
An earlier one than that.

987
01:17:12,708 --> 01:17:14,500
We were leftover stones

988
01:17:14,583 --> 01:17:17,250
from when the Goddess Nüwa
patched the sky.

989
01:17:17,875 --> 01:17:18,750
You?

990
01:17:19,833 --> 01:17:21,458
Six-Ears Macaque?

991
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:27,500
Actually,

992
01:17:30,375 --> 01:17:32,625
I am…

993
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,500
Sun Wukong, the Monkey King!

994
01:17:56,125 --> 01:17:59,291
Back then, I saw how useless

995
01:17:59,375 --> 01:18:01,416
those Buddhist scriptures were.

996
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:02,833
They can't cure

997
01:18:02,916 --> 01:18:05,083
the world's pain.

998
01:18:05,708 --> 01:18:07,041
But you, the Monkey King,

999
01:18:07,125 --> 01:18:09,250
proved your power in the Sky Palace.

1000
01:18:09,333 --> 01:18:10,666
Where there's suffering,

1001
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:12,416
your Gold Cudgel could fight it.

1002
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:14,125
What would that do?

1003
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:18,416
Injustice is like the waves of the sea.

1004
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:20,875
It comes and goes, goes and comes.

1005
01:18:20,958 --> 01:18:22,916
The stupid Order of the Gods.

1006
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,333
From order to chaos
and from chaos to order.

1007
01:18:27,041 --> 01:18:29,083
I've been around for millennia.

1008
01:18:29,166 --> 01:18:31,458
I couldn't change anything.

1009
01:18:31,958 --> 01:18:35,041
I'm completely useless.

1010
01:18:35,125 --> 01:18:36,666
You are the same.

1011
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:41,041
The Dragon King thinks
I'm hiding from enemies.

1012
01:18:43,166 --> 01:18:44,291
I'm just tired.

1013
01:18:45,250 --> 01:18:47,708
I don't even know
where I left my Gold Cudgel.

1014
01:18:48,625 --> 01:18:49,916
Li Yunxiang,

1015
01:18:50,916 --> 01:18:54,708
the red ribbon was your Astra.

1016
01:18:54,791 --> 01:18:56,375
The Sky Ribbon.

1017
01:18:59,916 --> 01:19:02,708
This hole leads to the East Sea.

1018
01:19:02,791 --> 01:19:04,875
Under a waterfall at the bottom of the sea

1019
01:19:04,958 --> 01:19:07,750
is a palace
of the Dragon King of East Sea.

1020
01:19:07,833 --> 01:19:11,583
He keeps river dragons captive there,

1021
01:19:11,666 --> 01:19:13,000
harnessing their strength

1022
01:19:13,083 --> 01:19:16,083
to empower the Dragon Pearl.

1023
01:19:16,166 --> 01:19:20,041
The thing about river dragons
is that they need fresh water to live.

1024
01:19:20,708 --> 01:19:22,666
So he stole Donghai's water.

1025
01:19:22,750 --> 01:19:23,791
Exactly.

1026
01:19:25,208 --> 01:19:28,500
Nezha's Sky Ribbon is down there,

1027
01:19:28,583 --> 01:19:30,791
tethering those dragons.

1028
01:19:31,541 --> 01:19:33,583
It's too bad, Li Yunxiang.

1029
01:19:33,666 --> 01:19:36,333
You can't do anything about it.

1030
01:19:36,416 --> 01:19:38,666
You can't use the Sky Ribbon.

1031
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:40,416
You are not Nezha.

1032
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:41,833
I'm not?

1033
01:19:41,916 --> 01:19:43,625
That kid behind you

1034
01:19:43,708 --> 01:19:46,541
appears when you are murderous.

1035
01:19:46,625 --> 01:19:49,166
But when you want to help people,

1036
01:19:49,250 --> 01:19:51,458
the kid is nowhere to be seen.

1037
01:19:51,541 --> 01:19:54,166
That scary, demon-killing,

1038
01:19:54,250 --> 01:19:57,000
and death-defying Nezha.

1039
01:19:57,083 --> 01:20:00,333
But where's the "soft heart"?

1040
01:20:01,375 --> 01:20:03,041
You are not Nezha.

1041
01:20:03,125 --> 01:20:05,625
You are not Nezha enough.

1042
01:20:21,875 --> 01:20:22,958
Yunxiang,

1043
01:20:23,041 --> 01:20:24,416
your brother woke up.

1044
01:20:37,208 --> 01:20:38,250
Jinxiang.

1045
01:20:40,083 --> 01:20:41,458
I'm so sorry.

1046
01:20:43,208 --> 01:20:44,666
Why are you pretending?

1047
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:46,500
Six's death is on him as well.

1048
01:20:47,125 --> 01:20:48,708
Who knows who is next?

1049
01:20:50,083 --> 01:20:51,291
It's true.

1050
01:20:51,375 --> 01:20:52,583
I'm so sorry.

1051
01:20:52,666 --> 01:20:53,833
What use is that?

1052
01:20:53,916 --> 01:20:55,250
You upset the De Clan.

1053
01:20:55,333 --> 01:20:57,375
They're bound to make trouble for us.

1054
01:20:57,458 --> 01:20:59,208
Look. Look around this room.

1055
01:20:59,291 --> 01:21:01,833
There are dead
and wounded people everywhere.

1056
01:21:01,916 --> 01:21:03,125
Isn't it all his fault?

1057
01:21:03,208 --> 01:21:04,875
He is a walking disaster.

1058
01:21:04,958 --> 01:21:07,708
-It was you who killed Six!
-Why are you still alive--

1059
01:21:07,791 --> 01:21:10,416
-You are lying.
-I saw you kill Six myself!

1060
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:12,250
And you sabotaged Yunxiang's armor!

1061
01:21:13,916 --> 01:21:16,041
So it was you.

1062
01:21:17,666 --> 01:21:18,833
Don't move!

1063
01:21:18,916 --> 01:21:21,666
Stand back!
One step forward and she is dead.

1064
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:24,250
All these deaths are all because of him.

1065
01:21:24,833 --> 01:21:26,500
He just wants to be the big hero.

1066
01:21:26,583 --> 01:21:28,250
But what about us?

1067
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:31,333
Kasha!

1068
01:21:47,583 --> 01:21:51,125
Such a big world

1069
01:21:55,583 --> 01:22:00,083
So many places

1070
01:22:03,666 --> 01:22:07,875
A free spirit like me

1071
01:22:09,166 --> 01:22:14,583
Could make memories anywhere

1072
01:22:17,916 --> 01:22:22,791
But there's a place

1073
01:22:24,125 --> 01:22:28,291
I cannot go

1074
01:22:32,166 --> 01:22:34,791
-That place is home
-I can't change anything.

1075
01:22:34,875 --> 01:22:37,125
Is it all useless?

1076
01:22:39,083 --> 01:22:43,541
That place is home

1077
01:23:30,583 --> 01:23:34,541
But young man

1078
01:23:37,166 --> 01:23:40,708
Why are you hesitant?

1079
01:23:44,041 --> 01:23:47,875
Flowers will bloom again

1080
01:23:50,958 --> 01:23:56,208
Just as they fall every year

1081
01:24:00,916 --> 01:24:03,375
Maybe nothing can be changed.

1082
01:24:04,208 --> 01:24:06,166
It's like our patients in the hospital.

1083
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:09,166
Whether we cure them or not,
they will still die one day.

1084
01:24:09,833 --> 01:24:11,583
But if they recover,

1085
01:24:11,666 --> 01:24:14,333
they have more time in this world.

1086
01:24:14,916 --> 01:24:17,791
I'm sure that this time

1087
01:24:17,875 --> 01:24:19,833
isn't useless from their perspective,

1088
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:22,625
or that of their family and friends.

1089
01:24:39,291 --> 01:24:41,458
Li Yunxiang, pull yourself together.

1090
01:24:42,333 --> 01:24:45,083
I also think you are a hero
with a body of flame

1091
01:24:45,166 --> 01:24:46,833
and boundless powers.

1092
01:25:04,083 --> 01:25:06,125
I know what I have to do.

1093
01:25:08,125 --> 01:25:11,416
I can't control the waves of the East Sea,

1094
01:25:12,916 --> 01:25:15,166
but I can go down to the Dragon's palace

1095
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:17,125
to defeat the Dragon King

1096
01:25:17,208 --> 01:25:18,583
and get back the water.

1097
01:25:21,333 --> 01:25:23,750
So many people were born

1098
01:25:23,833 --> 01:25:25,916
and lived in this world.

1099
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,666
The ones yet to be born

1100
01:25:28,291 --> 01:25:29,791
should still be able to live.

1101
01:25:31,083 --> 01:25:32,875
I'm doing this

1102
01:25:32,958 --> 01:25:34,250
for them.

1103
01:25:37,166 --> 01:25:38,375
That's enough for me.

1104
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,291
Come out, kid.

1105
01:25:56,208 --> 01:25:57,583
We need to talk.

1106
01:26:02,625 --> 01:26:04,166
Are you really me, kid?

1107
01:26:04,833 --> 01:26:06,625
You look like a child,

1108
01:26:07,291 --> 01:26:08,916
yet we are the same person?

1109
01:26:10,208 --> 01:26:12,708
Listen, I'm going to save people.

1110
01:26:12,791 --> 01:26:14,500
Not just one person,

1111
01:26:15,083 --> 01:26:16,791
but the whole city.

1112
01:26:16,875 --> 01:26:19,000
Anyway, you don't know them.

1113
01:26:19,083 --> 01:26:21,375
It's a pretty lofty and abstract goal.

1114
01:26:21,458 --> 01:26:23,541
I assume that eons of selfish behavior

1115
01:26:23,625 --> 01:26:25,500
mean that you won't be helping me.

1116
01:26:26,083 --> 01:26:28,541
So I, Li Yunxiang,

1117
01:26:28,625 --> 01:26:30,000
will go on my own.

1118
01:26:31,291 --> 01:26:33,666
The armor is a bit crude, but it'll do.

1119
01:26:34,416 --> 01:26:35,916
I made it myself.

1120
01:26:36,541 --> 01:26:39,458
You can just hide and leave me alone.

1121
01:26:45,875 --> 01:26:48,791
Little punk.
He really went when I said, "Get lost."

1122
01:29:34,833 --> 01:29:35,875
Thank you.

1123
01:30:58,583 --> 01:31:01,625
You have really come to kill us all.

1124
01:31:03,416 --> 01:31:04,750
There's no need to hurry.

1125
01:31:04,833 --> 01:31:08,041
I have a special guest for you.

1126
01:31:08,666 --> 01:31:09,791
Yunxiang!

1127
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:23,333
Yunxiang!

1128
01:31:30,333 --> 01:31:31,333
Dr. Su!

1129
01:31:34,541 --> 01:31:35,583
You are despicable.

1130
01:31:37,541 --> 01:31:39,208
Woman, you are only here

1131
01:31:39,291 --> 01:31:41,416
so I could mess with his head.

1132
01:31:48,125 --> 01:31:48,958
Yunxiang!

1133
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,708
Do you think you can defeat me?

1134
01:32:50,625 --> 01:32:51,875
Yunxiang!

1135
01:33:01,125 --> 01:33:03,000
You meager ant.

1136
01:33:03,083 --> 01:33:04,875
I should finish you off.

1137
01:33:13,958 --> 01:33:16,875
-Apologize!
-Shady business never ends well.

1138
01:33:16,958 --> 01:33:19,416
-You are a bad seed.
-You are the kiss of death.

1139
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:21,416
You bring disaster wherever you go.

1140
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:24,750
-All these deaths are all because of him.
-Who are these monsters?

1141
01:33:24,833 --> 01:33:26,208
He is a walking disaster.

1142
01:33:26,291 --> 01:33:27,625
-Yunxiang…
-Yunxiang.

1143
01:33:27,708 --> 01:33:29,125
Li Yunxiang!

1144
01:34:26,458 --> 01:34:27,291
Thank you.

1145
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:35,750
Do you think that's the end of it?

1146
01:34:35,833 --> 01:34:39,041
I haven't wasted these 3,000 years.

1147
01:34:39,125 --> 01:34:41,708
I've mastered the Tao of Transformation

1148
01:34:41,791 --> 01:34:44,458
just for this day.

1149
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:02,750
Nezha,

1150
01:35:02,833 --> 01:35:06,375
you are forcing me
to swallow the Dragon Pearl.

1151
01:35:10,583 --> 01:35:14,541
This will unchain the river dragons.

1152
01:35:14,625 --> 01:35:18,416
As they go,
they'll stir up a giant tsunami

1153
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:22,000
that will engulf
every living thing in Donghai.

1154
01:35:22,583 --> 01:35:28,208
You will have hurt
countless innocents again.

1155
01:37:34,458 --> 01:37:35,708
Hurry up!

1156
01:37:38,083 --> 01:37:40,125
-Run!
-Be careful!

1157
01:38:11,500 --> 01:38:12,625
Yunxiang.

1158
01:38:22,958 --> 01:38:23,875
Kid,

1159
01:38:24,583 --> 01:38:26,458
do you hear that noise?

1160
01:38:27,291 --> 01:38:29,541
It's the sound of the tsunami.

1161
01:38:30,625 --> 01:38:34,000
Donghai will be submerged.

1162
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,416
You are an ordinary mortal.

1163
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,041
Stop struggling.

1164
01:38:44,625 --> 01:38:46,041
Relax.

1165
01:38:46,125 --> 01:38:47,666
Give up.

1166
01:38:48,750 --> 01:38:51,416
Your fate isn't in your hands.

1167
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:53,708
It's assigned by Heaven.

1168
01:38:54,875 --> 01:38:57,458
Let Old Man Heaven

1169
01:38:58,250 --> 01:39:00,458
take you back.

1170
01:39:05,916 --> 01:39:07,291
Let me go.

1171
01:39:07,958 --> 01:39:11,708
You are not Nezha.

1172
01:39:17,041 --> 01:39:18,000
Tiger!

1173
01:39:23,333 --> 01:39:24,333
Run!

1174
01:39:35,458 --> 01:39:36,541
It's mine.

1175
01:39:37,166 --> 01:39:38,708
This life that was given to me

1176
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:41,083
is mine.

1177
01:39:44,583 --> 01:39:45,833
I don't need you

1178
01:39:46,583 --> 01:39:48,500
to tell me

1179
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,166
who I am.

1180
01:39:58,875 --> 01:40:02,541
I'll show you!

1181
01:40:40,750 --> 01:40:42,125
You can't die.

1182
01:40:44,083 --> 01:40:45,458
You can't die.

1183
01:40:45,541 --> 01:40:47,125
You won't die.

1184
01:40:48,708 --> 01:40:50,291
Aren't you Nezha?

1185
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:54,750
You won't die.

1186
01:42:34,083 --> 01:42:35,166
Kid.

1187
01:42:36,166 --> 01:42:37,541
We meet again.

1188
01:42:41,666 --> 01:42:43,875
I thought you left.

1189
01:42:44,541 --> 01:42:46,291
What are you doing here?

1190
01:42:51,666 --> 01:42:53,375
I did my best.

1191
01:42:56,833 --> 01:42:58,541
That tsunami…

1192
01:42:59,541 --> 01:43:00,875
Donghai…

1193
01:43:00,958 --> 01:43:02,958
All those people there,

1194
01:43:03,458 --> 01:43:07,041
can you save them?

1195
01:43:11,666 --> 01:43:12,791
Hey.

1196
01:43:16,833 --> 01:43:18,083
You…

1197
01:43:20,666 --> 01:43:23,375
should find your next incarnation.

1198
01:46:04,791 --> 01:46:07,333
-The tsunami has receded.
-The tsunami has receded.

1199
01:46:11,958 --> 01:46:14,500
-The tsunami has receded.
-The tsunami has receded.

1200
01:46:14,583 --> 01:46:16,916
-Thank goodness!
-That's great!

1201
01:46:17,708 --> 01:46:19,916
Ms. San, is this rain?

1202
01:47:16,916 --> 01:47:18,458
I got my Astra back.

1203
01:47:19,916 --> 01:47:21,375
I am Nezha.

1204
01:47:27,041 --> 01:47:29,541
Don't forget to return the motorcycle.

1205
01:47:29,625 --> 01:47:30,541
Thank you.

1206
01:47:43,166 --> 01:47:45,125
He acquired the Sky Ribbon.

1207
01:47:45,916 --> 01:47:48,541
There should be many other Nezha's Astras.

1208
01:47:48,625 --> 01:47:49,750
Let's see.

1209
01:47:50,291 --> 01:47:51,541
Cosmic Ring,

1210
01:47:51,625 --> 01:47:53,291
Fire Wheel,

1211
01:47:53,375 --> 01:47:54,625
and Dragon Catcher.

1212
01:47:55,125 --> 01:47:57,583
What were the others?

1213
01:47:57,666 --> 01:47:58,625
The others…

1214
01:48:05,625 --> 01:48:07,500
In the moment of death,

1215
01:48:08,583 --> 01:48:09,833
I became Nezha.

1216
01:48:11,875 --> 01:48:14,000
-Because the first Nezha…
-Well, Yunxiang?

1217
01:48:14,083 --> 01:48:15,583
…he was like this too.

1218
01:48:16,375 --> 01:48:18,458
-Are you ready?
-He and I both know,

1219
01:48:18,541 --> 01:48:19,875
in this world,

1220
01:48:20,583 --> 01:48:22,750
-if you don't want to accept fate…
-What's this?

1221
01:48:22,833 --> 01:48:24,958
-…you have to fight as hard as you can.
-So cute!

1222
01:48:29,375 --> 01:48:32,500
In my dream

1223
01:48:32,583 --> 01:48:36,083
There were you and me

1224
01:48:36,166 --> 01:48:40,416
It never seemed real

1225
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:43,541
From the beginning

1226
01:48:43,625 --> 01:48:46,041
When a true heart

1227
01:48:46,125 --> 01:48:49,333
-This is my world.
-Can't betray the power of youth anymore

1228
01:48:49,416 --> 01:48:50,958
This is our world.

1229
01:48:51,041 --> 01:48:53,416
Tomorrow, today, and yesterday's fate

1230
01:48:53,500 --> 01:48:54,833
I am Li Yunxiang.

1231
01:48:54,916 --> 01:48:58,041
-Had been decided at that moment
-I am Nezha.

1232
01:48:58,541 --> 01:49:01,833
NEW GODS: NEZHA REBORN

1233
01:49:01,916 --> 01:49:04,833
How many souls are at war?

1234
01:49:04,916 --> 01:49:08,166
After saying goodbye
To the confusing youth

1235
01:49:09,125 --> 01:49:11,750
How many still hold onto dreams?

1236
01:49:11,833 --> 01:49:15,791
The wind blew past the seasons

1237
01:49:15,875 --> 01:49:19,208
Flowers bloomed and faded again

1238
01:49:19,291 --> 01:49:22,750
The rain seeped into my heart

1239
01:49:22,833 --> 01:49:25,833
Wandering in the vast sea of people

1240
01:49:25,916 --> 01:49:29,333
A pure heart

1241
01:49:29,416 --> 01:49:33,000
Spends the entire lifetime
Pursuing a dream

1242
01:49:33,083 --> 01:49:36,375
A sincere person

1243
01:49:36,458 --> 01:49:40,208
Is willing to end with a good dream

1244
01:49:40,291 --> 01:49:44,541
One burns for his dream in this life

1245
01:49:44,625 --> 01:49:47,666
It's what he yearns for in this life

1246
01:49:47,750 --> 01:49:51,541
A dream comes true in this life

1247
01:49:51,625 --> 01:49:58,000
It comes from what the heart wants

1248
01:50:00,166 --> 01:50:07,166
STAY TUNED FOR POST-CREDITS SCENE

1249
01:50:07,250 --> 01:50:14,250
STAY TUNED FOR POST-CREDITS SCENE

1250
01:50:14,333 --> 01:50:18,833
STAY TUNED FOR POST-CREDITS SCENE

1251
01:50:18,916 --> 01:50:23,541
STAY TUNED FOR POST-CREDITS SCENE

1252
01:50:52,291 --> 01:50:56,125
Walking through a bustling city

1253
01:50:56,208 --> 01:50:59,500
Slowly ignoring worldly affairs

1254
01:50:59,583 --> 01:51:03,375
A sigh by the window

1255
01:51:03,458 --> 01:51:06,833
Reveals whispered dreams in this life

1256
01:51:06,916 --> 01:51:10,833
Pondering under the moon

1257
01:51:10,916 --> 01:51:13,875
Who decides what happens in life?

1258
01:51:13,958 --> 01:51:17,625
The loyal heart of a child is unstoppable

1259
01:51:17,708 --> 01:51:21,583
Showing his ambition

1260
01:51:21,666 --> 01:51:25,416
Yesterday's flowers

1261
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:29,000
Faded without regrets

1262
01:51:29,083 --> 01:51:32,083
Fallen leaves have wilted

1263
01:51:32,166 --> 01:51:35,583
Who else but me?

1264
01:52:27,250 --> 01:52:29,500
MO LIQING

1265
01:52:29,583 --> 01:52:31,375
AO BING

1266
01:52:35,583 --> 01:52:39,416
ORDER OF THE GODS

1267
01:52:45,125 --> 01:52:47,000
STAY TUNED FOR POST-CREDITS SCENE

1268
01:52:47,083 --> 01:52:49,166
Such a big world

1269
01:52:49,833 --> 01:52:52,125
So many places

1270
01:52:52,833 --> 01:52:55,291
A free spirit like me

1271
01:52:55,375 --> 01:52:57,958
Could linger anywhere

1272
01:52:58,583 --> 01:53:00,958
Such a big world

1273
01:53:01,583 --> 01:53:04,500
So many young men

1274
01:53:04,583 --> 01:53:07,250
A free spirit like me

1275
01:53:07,333 --> 01:53:10,458
Could find love anywhere

1276
01:53:10,541 --> 01:53:12,708
There's a place

1277
01:53:13,416 --> 01:53:15,458
I cannot go

1278
01:53:16,333 --> 01:53:18,416
There's a young man

1279
01:53:19,250 --> 01:53:21,458
I can't even say hello to

1280
01:53:22,250 --> 01:53:24,500
That place is home

1281
01:53:25,166 --> 01:53:27,458
That man is you

1282
01:53:28,375 --> 01:53:31,125
But young man

1283
01:53:31,208 --> 01:53:33,541
Why are you hesitant?

1284
01:53:34,125 --> 01:53:36,625
Flowers will bloom again

1285
01:53:36,708 --> 01:53:38,666
Youth comes only once

1286
01:53:55,666 --> 01:53:59,458
It has always been this kind of world

1287
01:54:01,333 --> 01:54:04,458
Same air

1288
01:54:04,541 --> 01:54:08,083
Different fates

1289
01:54:08,166 --> 01:54:11,000
Begin to feel

1290
01:54:11,083 --> 01:54:16,083
Don't live in this kind of world

1291
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,750
Starting today

1292
01:54:23,833 --> 01:54:29,583
We live in this kind of world

1293
01:54:39,583 --> 01:54:41,333
Be who you are

1294
01:54:44,333 --> 01:54:45,333
Verta.

1295
01:54:46,041 --> 01:54:47,500
Blanca…

1296
01:54:47,583 --> 01:54:49,875
THE WHITE SNAKE TEAM CONTINUES
THEIR DESTINY FROM THE PAST

1297
01:54:49,958 --> 01:54:52,125
You'll be imprisoned forever
in Leifeng Pagoda!

1298
01:54:52,208 --> 01:54:54,416
Verta, persevere.

1299
01:54:54,500 --> 01:54:56,041
Blanca!

1300
01:54:56,125 --> 01:54:59,708
Can you break what destiny binds together?
I'll kill you, you stinking monk!

1301
01:54:59,791 --> 01:55:01,708
I'll send you to your next reincarnation!

1302
01:55:26,041 --> 01:55:26,958
WHITE SNAKE 2

1303
01:55:27,041 --> 01:55:28,958
DISASTER ENCOUNTERED
BY THE GREEN SNAKE

1304
01:55:29,041 --> 01:55:30,083
COMING SOON IN 2021

1305
01:55:48,500 --> 01:55:51,583

PLEASE LOOK FORWARD TO IT IN 2022
