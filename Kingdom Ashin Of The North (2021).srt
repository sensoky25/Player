1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000


2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000


3
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,603
BASED ON THE KINGDOM OF THE GODS BY YLAB

4
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:42,477
THE JAPANESE INVASION LEFT
THE SOUTHERN LANDS OF JOSEON IN RUINS.

5
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,942
AND NOW ANOTHER STORM WAS LOOMING
IN THE NORTHERN LANDS OF JOSEON.

6
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:54,405
THE JURCHENS ACROSS THE MANCHURIAN PLAIN
NORTH OF THE AMNOK RIVER

7
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:58,409
STARTED GATHERING AT THE BASIN
OF THE PAJEO RIVER

8
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:02,831
UNDER THE FLAG
OF THE VICIOUS, POWERFUL PAJEOWI.

9
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:10,588
WHEN 10,000 JURCHENS GATHER,
NO ARMY IN THE WORLD CAN DEFEAT THEM.

10
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:15,093
FEELING THREATENED
BY THE PAJEOWI'S SUSPICIOUS MOVE,

11
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:19,013
WARRIORS OF JOSEON
SCOUTED ANOTHER GROUP OF THE JURCHENS

12
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:22,892
IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM IN CHECK.

13
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,397
THEY WERE JURCHENS LIVING IN JOSEON
CALLED SEONGJEOYAIN.

14
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,733
SINCE THEY HAD LIVED IN JOSEON
FOR OVER A CENTURY,

15
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,987
THEY WERE NEITHER CONSIDERED JURCHENS

16
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,198
NOR ACCEPTED BY THE PEOPLE OF JOSEON
AS THEIR OWN

17
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,325
AND WERE SHUNNED BY ALL.

18
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,927
THIS PLANT BRINGS THE DEAD BACK TO LIFE…
BUT YOU MUST PAY THE PRICE

19
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:32,577
JURCHEN
JOSEON, HANYANG

20
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:40,585
PAJEOWI, BOUNDARY VILLAGE, PYESA-GUN

21
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:20,833
PYESA-GUN

22
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,131
What's that?

23
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:03,960
CITADEL OF MANPO

24
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,923
Isn't he the deputy commander
of the Chupajin troops?

25
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,885
Don't tell me
there's another debacle coming.

26
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,721
I suppose the rumors are true.

27
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:16,806
What rumors?

28
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:19,684
Well…

29
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:23,896
I heard some Jurchens went into Pyesa-gun
to get wild ginseng

30
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,314
and were all killed.

31
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:30,987
What? It's against the law
to enter Pyesa-gun.

32
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,656
I can't believe such a horrible thing
happened there.

33
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:37,201
I heard something scary lives there.

34
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:41,080
I heard none of those wild ginseng hunters
came back out alive.

35
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,459
No one has been allowed to enter
for the past 100 years.

36
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,588
Who knows if some vicious monster
lives there?

37
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,874
They all have the same tattoo.

38
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,293
They're Pajeowi Jurchens.

39
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,378
The word has already spread.

40
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,089
It's only a matter of time
before the Pajeowi find out.

41
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,174
What should we do?

42
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,509
Let's go to the boundary village.

43
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:04,538
Do not look.

44
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,791
Animal blood and innards
are for the lowborn.

45
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,639
There. It's ready.

46
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,025
Remove your filthy hands.

47
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,954
Let's go.

48
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:06,475
Hey!

49
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:09,854
Let's have some meat!

50
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,815
BOUNDARY VILLAGE

51
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,317
A VILLAGE
WHERE THE JURCHENS IN JOSEON LIVE

52
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,652
This is good.

53
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,487
It tastes amazing.

54
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,784
It's great!

55
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,953
How long has it been
since we last had meat?

56
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,498
It's Ashin!

57
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:30,833
Ashin!

58
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,505
Come, Ashin. Let's eat.

59
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,512
Do you want some more?

60
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,638
It's good, isn't it?

61
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,190
Hey! How dare you?

62
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:55,858
Give it back.

63
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,111
-Hey--
-I'm sorry.

64
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,368
I told you not to go to Pyesa-gun!

65
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,996
But you said
it's not actually dangerous there.

66
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:13,334
You told me yourself that people
in high places spread false rumors

67
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,544
so they could take all the wild ginseng.

68
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,463
That's why you should never go there.

69
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,217
Soldiers are more dangerous than monsters.

70
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,593
Then what do we do?

71
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,554
Just let Mom die?

72
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:39,235
They say the wild ginseng there
can even bring back the dead--

73
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,237
You're not a ginseng hunter.

74
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:45,491
How will you find wild ginseng
in that huge mountain?

75
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:48,786
I'm not sure if it was wild ginseng,
but I saw a strange plant.

76
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,331
It was drawn on a mural
at an abandoned shrine.

77
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,166
It says it can bring back the dead.

78
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,376
Nonsense.

79
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,630
There are no shrines left in that area.

80
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,216
-But I saw it--
-Stop talking nonsense.

81
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,884
Listen to me and do not go there.

82
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,721
Those who sneaked in there and got caught

83
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,641
had their tongues cut out.

84
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,647
I can never let that happen to you.

85
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:54,727
I was planning to travel to Chupajin

86
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,438
to offer these gifts to you, my lord.

87
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,276
Fifteen Pajeowi Jurchens
who went into Pyesa-gun

88
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:05,946
to hunt wild ginseng were all found dead.

89
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:11,619
Are you sure
they are the Pajeowi Jurchens?

90
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:17,166
But who would do something like that?

91
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,085
A tiger.

92
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:25,132
You will have to cross the river.

93
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,927
Go spread the word
that all the Pajeowi Jurchens

94
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,304
were killed by a tiger.

95
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,354
Understood, my lord.

96
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:45,527
When will my village

97
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,364
receive an official government position?

98
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,241
We are aware of your loyalty.

99
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,244
Be patient and wait.

100
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,621
Good news will come.

101
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,508
We’re heading out. Get ready.

102
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:14,848
JOSEON MILITARY CAMP, CHUPAJIN

103
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:26,276
We have brought all the corpses
found in Pyesa-gun as you ordered, sir.

104
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:53,554
We've verified that the limbs were torn
by wild animals,

105
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,514
but it happened postmortem.

106
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,558
It wasn't a tiger.

107
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,103
They were killed by humans.

108
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,647
I am aware.

109
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,157
If 10,000 Jurchens gather…

110
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,118
a great danger will befall us.

111
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,821
Hold out a hand,
and you shall receive help.

112
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,449
Pull out a knife, and you shall be slain.

113
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:11,048
While Joseon was floundering in chaos
during the Japanese invasion,

114
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,342
Aidagan, the head of the Pajeowi,

115
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,428
has gathered the Jurchens under his wing.

116
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,181
The Japanese in the south
are preparing another attack.

117
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:24,311
If the Pajeowi in the north use this
as a reason to invade us as well,

118
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:26,730
what will happen to this country?

119
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:31,151
We can never let them know
their men were killed by our people.

120
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,405
They were attacked…

121
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,826
by a tiger.

122
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,628
The deputy commander
from Chupajin is here.

123
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:50,712
Let him in.

124
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,720
Have a drink, my lord

125
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,357
What brings you here at this hour?

126
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:27,624
We found 15 dead Pajeowi Jurchens.

127
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,793
Are you certain there were 15 of them?

128
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:33,547
Why? Did I get the number wrong?

129
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,802
I heard you went hunting
in the Birch Pass two days ago.

130
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,726
Since when…

131
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,396
do I need your permission to go hunting?

132
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:54,151
Pajeowi Jurchens receive
martial arts training from an early age.

133
00:19:54,985 --> 00:20:00,574
It is near impossible to take down
15 of them at once.

134
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:03,911
Unless it was you and your elite guards
who did it.

135
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,809
You'd better discipline your men
before someone else finds out.

136
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,650
Those Jurchen rats…

137
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:39,613
dared to steal
the Haewon Cho Clan's wild ginseng.

138
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,740
They all deserved to die.

139
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:45,535
You should have captured and punished them
according to the law.

140
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:50,916
And the Haewon Cho Clan
does not own those wild ginseng.

141
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:54,419
They belong to His Majesty the King.

142
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,970
Do you think you can insult me
and my family like this

143
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,056
just because I am stuck

144
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,725
in the boondocks now?

145
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,186
You abandoned the people
and fled during the war.

146
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,563
That is why you're here.

147
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:18,151
If you endanger this country once again,

148
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,737
you will not be able to
avoid the consequences…

149
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,200
even if you are from the Haewon Cho Clan.

150
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,623
The people are growing anxious,

151
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:35,335
so I will begin a tiger hunt to calm them.

152
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:41,675
I advise you to stay put
and stay out of trouble.

153
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:52,519
This is a warning.

154
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:44,654
AMNOK RIVER, BORDER AREA

155
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:54,331
BOUNDARY VILLAGE

156
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,876
Are you sure it was a tiger?

157
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,712
The Pajeowi learn martial arts
as soon as they can walk.

158
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,800
How can a single tiger kill them all?

159
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,821
If it's a lie,

160
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,281
it'll rub them the wrong way.

161
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,118
It might put you in danger, Father.

162
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,412
Being undercover

163
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,207
is always dangerous.

164
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,963
Look after the family while I'm gone.

165
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:45,549
All right, then.

166
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,807
Let's just cross the river
and go back to our clan.

167
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,059
You let them take
all your hard-earned pelts

168
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,520
and even risk your life
to go undercover for them.

169
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:02,023
Will you let them walk all over you
forever?

170
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,407
Pyesa-gun. Our ancestors lived there.

171
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:14,661
The King of Joseon
bestowed the land upon our clan,

172
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:17,622
who was battling hunger and thieves
on the barren field

173
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,041
on the other side of the river.

174
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,043
The King also offered us a public office

175
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,838
and exempted us from paying taxes.

176
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:34,264
Joseon was gracious to us.

177
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:37,267
Hence, I cannot betray Joseon.

178
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:46,818
They may have been gracious
to our ancestors,

179
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,196
but they took back everything
they had given us.

180
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,284
Hang in there just a little longer.

181
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:58,413
Soon, I will officially be appointed
and we'll be able to live a good life.

182
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,214
I think we should call for a doctor.

183
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,758
You know very well

184
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,386
that no doctor would come here.

185
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,265
Then what do we do?

186
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,730
Stay with Mom until I come back.

187
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,735
Ashin! Hurry back!

188
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,406
JURCHEN VILLAGE, NORTH OF AMNOK RIVER

189
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:17,242
Far past the Amnok River

190
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,662
is Mount Baekdu,
Joseon's highest mountain.

191
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:26,543
It's so huge that you'll find
all kinds of trees and animals.

192
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,838
The most famous one among them

193
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,048
is the tiger.

194
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:41,641
They say that
this tiger is 1,000 years old.

195
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:46,187
Sometimes,
it even transforms into a human.

196
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,523
Lies!

197
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:51,526
No, it's true!

198
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:59,159
Over 1,000 men have gone into the mountain
to catch the tiger, but they all died.

199
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:07,500
Even the Pajeowi Jurchens
who climbed the Birch Pass recently

200
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,879
all got eaten by that tiger.

201
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,924
Is that true?

202
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,301
It sure is.

203
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,304
I saw it with my own two eyes.

204
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:23,808
You'd better be telling the truth.

205
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,065
If you're spreading false rumors,

206
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,195
you will die.

207
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,587
PYESA-GUN

208
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:23,094
THIS PLANT BRINGS THE DEAD BACK TO LIFE…

209
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:27,182
BUT YOU MUST PAY THE PRICE

210
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:41,029
Our hunt will take place
in the Birch Pass.

211
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,740
We will begin the hunt in these two areas.

212
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:45,784
The Chupajin soldiers will spread out,

213
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:48,077
guard the trails, and go after them.

214
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,329
We'll lure them out…

215
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:52,540
to here.

216
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,085
You want to lure them out to Pyesa-gun.

217
00:29:58,755 --> 00:29:59,756
Do not forget.

218
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,591
We will only pretend to hunt them.

219
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,475
When hunting a tiger,

220
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:13,770
you should not go too slow or too fast.

221
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:14,896
If we're too fast,

222
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,398
it might end up attacking us.

223
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,735
All right. Let's go!

224
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:22,821
Let's go!

225
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,447
Begin!

226
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,241
Get a move on!

227
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,755
It's a tiger's paw print.

228
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,137
It's odd though.

229
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:52,892
Tigers hate the sound of gongs,
so they usually move away from it,

230
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,102
but not this one.

231
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,271
What do you mean?

232
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,274
It's moving towards the hunters.

233
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:50,885
It's a tiger.

234
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:54,430
It's not a tiger…

235
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:02,855
It's a monster.

236
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,072
Tell the hunters to fall back.

237
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,449
We'll take it from here.

238
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,457
Retreat!

239
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:24,627
-Move it!
-Retreat!

240
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,771
It's the Pajeowi. Stop them!

241
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:37,927
Sir!

242
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,961
How bizarre.

243
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:55,838
It was already dead.

244
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,549
How is this possible?

245
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,068
Here's what's really bizarre.

246
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:20,154
We were told that our brothers
were killed by a tiger.

247
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,783
Then where are their flesh and bones?

248
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:27,328
They crossed the borders
and entered Pyesa-gun,

249
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,829
which is against the law.

250
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:32,500
There is no reason for us
to be held responsible for their deaths.

251
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,671
Our brothers died on Joseon soil.

252
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:41,175
Brace yourselves for a bloody revenge.

253
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:31,892
Ashin?

254
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,294
Fire!

255
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:05,439
JOSEON MILITARY CAMP, CHUPAJIN

256
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:37,388
I heard about the tragic massacre
in your village.

257
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,848
Are you the only one who survived?

258
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:44,770
What happened to your father?

259
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,700
I heard the Pajeowi…

260
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:04,915
have executed a spy from Joseon.

261
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:09,128
Did you cross the river
and go all the way there?

262
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,381
I do not get it.

263
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:19,305
Why would the Pajeowi do this to us?

264
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:26,061
I have been racking my brain,
but I really do not get it.

265
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,816
Have you come to see me to find out why?

266
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,444
No.

267
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,116
That is not important.

268
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:45,331
Please avenge my father's death.

269
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,294
A lowborn weakling like me cannot do it.

270
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,173
But Joseon is a strong country

271
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:56,216
and has the power to punish them.

272
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,010
I am sorry for your loss,

273
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:02,139
but this is not a matter
Joseon can intervene in.

274
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:03,223
My father…

275
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:07,436
was loyal to Joseon all his life.

276
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:15,736
Although you could not
have him appointed officially…

277
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:20,032
you could at least do this for him.

278
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:24,370
It doesn't have to be right away.

279
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:27,790
Next year… No, the following year…

280
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,834
or even a decade or two later.

281
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:38,509
Make them shed tears of blood…

282
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,347
then I will make peace with it.

283
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:46,183
I will do anything.

284
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,769
I will be your spy

285
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:51,438
or even work as a butcher
if you tell me to.

286
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:58,195
I will gladly do anything
even if it's something worse than that.

287
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:07,996
Please avenge my father's death.

288
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,002
Take this child.

289
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:32,438
It looks like a Jurchen girl.

290
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:39,653
This is where you will stay.

291
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,294
I heard she is a survivor
from the boundary village.

292
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,588
That tenacious little wench.

293
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:47,674
I heard she buried all the bodies
by herself.

294
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:15,494
PAJEOWI MILITARY CAMP

295
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:31,987
-Hey.
-What?

296
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:33,196
What are you looking at?

297
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:12,778
Ashin.

298
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:20,535
Get out.

299
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:25,791
Do you think

300
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,752
you can survive here…

301
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:33,632
after killing a Joseon soldier?

302
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:51,942
I guess you're too big to fit in here now.

303
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:52,919
Good job.

304
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,940
MESSENGER

305
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:15,901
It's an urgent message!

306
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:18,403
The peace conference with the Japanese
was called off?

307
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:19,613
Yes, sir.

308
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:21,573
His Majesty has ordered every troop

309
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:24,075
to assemble in the south
except those in Uiju and Kanggye.

310
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:37,839
We will leave a few soldiers behind
and prepare for battle.

311
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:38,882
Yes, sir.

312
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:43,178
But keep a close watch
on the Pajeowi's every move.

313
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:44,512
Yes, sir.

314
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:50,352
Sir.

315
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:52,729
What atrocity is this?

316
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:55,023
Please forgive me.

317
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:57,317
If this happens again,

318
00:53:58,276 --> 00:54:00,153
I will not let it go unpunished.

319
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:02,280
I will remember that, sir.

320
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:17,671
I need you to cross the river again.

321
00:54:18,254 --> 00:54:21,675
You need to find out in detail
what the Pajeowi are up to.

322
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:37,482
PAJEOWI MAIN MILITARY BASE

323
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:12,619
Open your mouth.

324
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:16,122
Open up.

325
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,333
You should live a long life.

326
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:48,631
SPY WHO BETRAYED HIS OWN TRIBE

327
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:58,558
Dad…

328
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,276
Dad, it's me.

329
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:13,907
Dad…

330
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:20,288
It's me, Dad…

331
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:38,181
Please…

332
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:40,266
Kill me…

333
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:42,644
Dad.

334
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:44,938
Dad, let's…

335
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:47,649
Let's go home.

336
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:49,651
It's okay.

337
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:53,279
Everything will be okay, so let's go home.

338
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:55,448
Let's go back together.

339
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,660
Kill me.

340
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:03,665
No more…

341
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:14,759
Just kill me.

342
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:41,202
Let's go back.

343
00:59:57,218 --> 00:59:58,386
Please…

344
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:01,180
Kill me now.

345
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:03,558
Ashin.

346
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:08,479
Ashin.

347
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:13,479
COMMANDER'S OFFICE, CHUPAJIN

348
01:02:23,781 --> 01:02:24,615
Ashin?

349
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:54,103
Some Pajeowi Jurchens sneaked
into Pyesa-gun to steal ginseng.

350
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:56,564
All of them were attacked and killed.

351
01:02:57,982 --> 01:03:02,904
A war with Pajeowi Jurchens
seemed imminent due to growing tensions,

352
01:03:02,987 --> 01:03:05,990
but we wiped out a seongjeoyain village

353
01:03:06,073 --> 01:03:08,326
and managed to prevent such a disaster.

354
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:13,706
Our brothers died on Joseon soil.

355
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:17,043
Brace yourselves for a bloody revenge.

356
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:24,592
Stop.

357
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:34,519
Even if you kill us now,

358
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:36,103
our brothers will come after you.

359
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:39,190
And you'll have a bigger price to pay.

360
01:03:39,273 --> 01:03:40,775
You are right.

361
01:03:41,442 --> 01:03:44,070
Your brothers were not killed by a tiger.

362
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:45,905
They were attacked.

363
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:53,621
We found this

364
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:55,998
where your brothers were killed.

365
01:04:19,772 --> 01:04:23,901
Have you come to see me to find out why?

366
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:27,655
Please avenge my father's death.

367
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,314
Look after the family while I'm gone.

368
01:05:40,978 --> 01:05:41,854
Ashin.

369
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:44,607
Ashin.

370
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:55,952
What is this flower?

371
01:06:40,454 --> 01:06:41,497
What is that?

372
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:42,957
Beats me.

373
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:25,207
What's this? Help him up.

374
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:27,418
Help! Help me.

375
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:24,725
What the hell?

376
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:30,856
Gosh, it's cold.

377
01:08:37,738 --> 01:08:38,906
It's so cold.

378
01:08:58,801 --> 01:08:59,802
Is he dead?

379
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:01,303
Wait…

380
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:07,143
What the…

381
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:30,291
Get away from me!

382
01:13:37,037 --> 01:13:39,498
Close the door! Hurry!

383
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:03,063
Is he dead?

384
01:14:03,147 --> 01:14:03,981
What is that?

385
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:56,742
Get away from me!

386
01:16:40,053 --> 01:16:41,054
Ashin…

387
01:16:52,232 --> 01:16:54,985
Help me, Ashin.

388
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:09,082
No…

389
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:11,460
Ashin! What are you doing?

390
01:17:11,543 --> 01:17:13,795
No, please! Don't kill me!

391
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:14,713
Ashin!

392
01:19:40,734 --> 01:19:41,735
Ashin.

393
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:44,321
Don't kill me.

394
01:19:47,908 --> 01:19:49,576
I'm sorry for everything.

395
01:19:50,994 --> 01:19:52,120
Please spare me.

396
01:20:35,789 --> 01:20:37,082
Ashin, you're back!

397
01:20:39,751 --> 01:20:40,752
Yes.

398
01:20:42,295 --> 01:20:43,755
I'm back.

399
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:27,359
You didn't eat anything again.

400
01:22:28,109 --> 01:22:29,819
I told you that you have to eat.

401
01:23:06,064 --> 01:23:08,984
I don't think I took proper care of you
all this time.

402
01:23:13,738 --> 01:23:15,532
Pheasants, deer, rabbits…

403
01:23:16,908 --> 01:23:18,827
That's not what you wanted, after all.

404
01:23:52,569 --> 01:23:54,154
From now on…

405
01:23:56,823 --> 01:23:59,200
I'll provide you
with only delicious meals.

406
01:24:06,624 --> 01:24:07,876
Ashin!

407
01:24:09,961 --> 01:24:12,714
Ashin!

408
01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:20,388
Ashin!

409
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:22,640
Ashin, no!

410
01:24:25,643 --> 01:24:26,895
Ashin!

411
01:25:08,269 --> 01:25:09,145
How is it?

412
01:25:42,011 --> 01:25:43,179
I am not lonely.

413
01:25:44,722 --> 01:25:47,058
We are together, so I am not lonely.

414
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:50,687
When my job here is done,

415
01:25:51,855 --> 01:25:55,483
after I kill every living thing
on Joseon and Jurchen soil,

416
01:25:56,776 --> 01:25:58,611
I will join you.

417
01:26:08,079 --> 01:26:12,709
JOSEON BORDER, UIJU

418
01:26:12,792 --> 01:26:14,711
I heard the Japanese
attacked the south again.

419
01:26:15,295 --> 01:26:17,088
What if they come all the way up here?

420
01:26:17,922 --> 01:26:20,884
I heard the envoys left
to request help from the Great Empire.

421
01:26:23,344 --> 01:26:26,556
If they help us,
we won't be overrun like last time.

422
01:26:29,058 --> 01:26:32,896
The envoys are here!

423
01:27:07,513 --> 01:27:08,848
Can this plant…

424
01:27:08,932 --> 01:27:10,642
PHYSICIAN LEE SEUNG-HUI

425
01:27:10,725 --> 01:27:13,478
…really bring back the dead?

426
01:27:14,145 --> 01:27:15,396
Yes, that is correct.

427
01:27:16,856 --> 01:27:18,691
Before the nervous system rots,

428
01:27:19,567 --> 01:27:21,903
mash the plant and put it
on an acupuncture needle…

429
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:25,823
and pierce the needle one pun deep
into the glabellar.

430
01:27:31,329 --> 01:27:34,666
And the corpse will come back to life
in two hours.

431
01:32:34,548 --> 01:32:39,553
