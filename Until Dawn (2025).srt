1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000

3
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:27,963
No! No! No!

4
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:39,975
Yes.

5
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,458
No.

6
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,377
No, no.

7
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,920
Please.

8
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:11,089
No, I can't die again.

9
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:13,509
I can't. I can't do it.

10
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,970
Please, not again. I can't.

11
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,681
No. No, no.

12
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:21,433
No. No. No, please!

13
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:22,518
No!

14
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,108
It looks like rain.

15
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:19,825
Hey. So, what's the plan
when we get there?

16
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,994
Like, we gonna do some sort
of ritual or something?

17
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,328
I'm not prepared
for any rituals.

18
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:25,455
Not your "woo-woo"
kind of ritual.

19
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:28,792
More like a closing ceremony
thing, you know?

20
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,878
This is the last stop
of our tour,

21
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:32,963
and even though we've learned
absolutely nothing new,

22
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,673
we should probably
mark the occasion.

23
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:38,552
Like a celebration
of our failure kind of thing?

24
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,222
-Yeah. Sure. Whatever.
-Right.

25
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:44,808
I'm not really sure
what we were expecting anyways.

26
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,977
Closure. Isn't that usually

27
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,896
what people are after
in these kinds of situations?

28
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,606
We're not getting closure.

29
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:53,025
She's missing. Not dead.

30
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:56,653
No. Yeah, of course.
I was just asking.

31
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,706
Wait, wait, wait. Clover,
please don't delete. Just...

32
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,292
Just watch.

33
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:15,672
Look, I know I could've
handled our goodbye differently.

34
00:04:16,964 --> 00:04:20,177
I could've handled everything
after Mom's death differently.

35
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,055
I just couldn't stay
in that house any longer.

36
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,807
But it's not too late
for you to join me.

37
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:29,436
I know it's not an easy decision

38
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,188
but, please, call me back.

39
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:32,814
I miss you.

40
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,663
Kinda eerie being here
a year later.

41
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:48,997
Max!

42
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:50,123
What?

43
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:51,375
He's right though.

44
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,878
It is. It's eerie
and it's kinda sad.

45
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:56,880
Sorry, Clover.

46
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,553
I think we should join hands.

47
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:03,887
-No.
-Jesus Christ, Megan.

48
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,639
We've done it literally
everywhere else.

49
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,058
It'd feel kind of incomplete
if we didn't do it here.

50
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,143
Clover knows I've got
special shit going on, so--

51
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:11,520
Special shit going on?

52
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,730
Your biggest psychic achievement
was when you "sensed"

53
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:15,107
that your dad
was having an affair

54
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,441
with Max's mom
before anybody else.

55
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,318
-I was right.
-Remember that one, Clover?

56
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:20,779
I mean, we all sensed it when
we heard them in the garage.

57
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:22,281
Gross. And that's still my mom.

58
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:25,033
But, actually,
can we try, please?

59
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:26,118
She probably disappeared

60
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,995
not long after that video
was recorded

61
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,621
and that's a pretty big deal.

62
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:30,914
And we all feel it.

63
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:33,750
So maybe we'll tap into
some of her residual energy.

64
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,253
Yeah, it's fine.
Let's do the hand thing.

65
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,755
Okay, okay, great. Great. Okay.

66
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:39,882
-Okay.
-All right.

67
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:41,258
It's fine.

68
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,467
Now, everyone.

69
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,053
Close your eyes.

70
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,684
And try to tune everything out.

71
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:55,272
You have to think of it
like an old radio or TV.

72
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,192
So sometimes you catch a signal,

73
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:01,361
but most of the time
it's just static.

74
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,031
Keep trying.

75
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:05,866
Slow your breathing down.

76
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:07,659
In.

77
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,078
And out.

78
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:13,874
In.

79
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:16,460
And out.

80
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,796
In.

81
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:21,507
And out.

82
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:23,425
-Oh, my God!
-Watch out!

83
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:24,593
Get out of the road!

84
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:26,887
Slow down!

85
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,847
-Jesus Christ.
-What the hell?

86
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:31,808
Okay.

87
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,144
Let's try again, okay? So...

88
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:35,229
Clover?

89
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,857
-Clover! Hey!
-Hey, Max.

90
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:42,194
Just stop. Just give her
some space for a second, okay?

91
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,905
Don't forget why she dumped you
in the first place.

92
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:47,366
She didn't dump me.
I broke up with her.

93
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:50,118
Because she wanted space,
which you wouldn't give her.

94
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:51,870
Since when have you
been the expert on space?

95
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:54,665
Excuse me?
What is that supposed to mean?

96
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:55,958
Ever since kindergarten,

97
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,584
you've always needed
to be in a relationship.

98
00:06:57,668 --> 00:06:59,294
-She does? Do you?
-No, I do not.

99
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:01,839
Six months ago,
there was a guy just like you.

100
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,049
And three months before that,
there was a girl just like you.

101
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,968
-Julia.
-Julia?

102
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,177
How long have you guys
been together for?

103
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:08,846
-Three months.
-Three months.

104
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:11,431
Hopefully she waits to break up
with you till we get back.

105
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:13,058
-Max.
-Well, if she doesn't,

106
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,726
do you guys
still have Julia's number?

107
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:16,353
Fuck off.

108
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:34,788
Hey.

109
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:37,499
Hey.

110
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:38,584
Just that.

111
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:40,711
Two dollars.

112
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,255
Thank you.

113
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:46,466
Excuse me, I saw you
and your friends out there.

114
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,593
What was that?

115
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:50,846
Like a prayer circle?

116
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,557
Yeah, something like that.

117
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,936
-'Kay. Thank you.
-Yeah. You bet.

118
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,985
Sorry, were you
working here last year?

119
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,613
Last year
and the year before that

120
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:10,365
and the year before that
and the year before that,

121
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,201
and on and on and on.

122
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:14,286
You know,
each year is the same...

123
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:16,747
but different.

124
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,791
Totally.

125
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,960
Well, then
can I ask you something?

126
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,256
Does she look
familiar to you at all?

127
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:27,966
Pretty.

128
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:31,970
She looks a lot like you.

129
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:36,058
She's gone missing, huh?

130
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,311
I didn't say that.

131
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:42,563
Well, you're not
the first one who come here

132
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,943
asking me if I seen someone.

133
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:49,488
Do a lot of people
go missing around here?

134
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:50,572
Here? No.

135
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:53,992
But up the ways a bit
in Glore Valley.

136
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,286
That's where people
get in trouble.

137
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:58,372
Glore Valley?

138
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,290
Yeah.

139
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,171
Stop.

140
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,423
-You're so grumpy today.
-Hey.

141
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:10,717
Can I say something real quick

142
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:11,802
before Clover comes back
out here?

143
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,512
-Yeah.
-You guys told me this trip

144
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,430
was like
a get-out-of-town kind of thing.

145
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:16,890
You know, I didn't realise
we were gonna be

146
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:19,810
retracing her sister's
final journey.

147
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,144
So I just have to say,

148
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:22,437
-as a psych major...
-As a psych major...

149
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,274
Yes. Thank you.

150
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:28,986
As a psych major, I don't know

151
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,029
if this is the best thing
for Clover.

152
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:32,489
I think the intentions
were great.

153
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:35,284
Exactly. And this could be
what she needs to move on.

154
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:37,494
Or this could trigger her to...

155
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:40,372
you know, again.

156
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:43,292
Then why did you come if
you thought it was a bad idea?

157
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,960
Just to spend more time
with Clover?

158
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,671
Because the way we get through
fucked-up shit

159
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,381
is by sticking together.
You know?

160
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,049
So let's not blame each other

161
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,676
for where we're at
right now, okay?

162
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,052
I mean, if we're gonna
blame anybody,

163
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:55,220
then it should be Melanie.

164
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,931
Their mom had just died
weeks before.

165
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,474
She shouldn't have left Clover
when she did.

166
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:00,976
That was
the selfish choice here.

167
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,060
Guys.

168
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,732
I think I know
where Mel went missing.

169
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:22,122
-Hey. It's okay.
-This is crazy.

170
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:24,082
The car is the safest place
to be during a storm.

171
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,459
Don't say shit like that, Max.

172
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:26,960
It's true.
Everyone knows that it's--

173
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:28,921
Max! Don't say shit like that.

174
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:30,047
Can we just turn around?

175
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,590
I don't understand
what I did wrong.

176
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:32,841
Because you're gonna jinx us.

177
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:34,176
Somebody says
something like that,

178
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,011
and then, wham,
Abe runs into something,

179
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,095
then we're all fucking dead.

180
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:38,680
So don't say shit like that.

181
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:40,182
Can we just turn around, please?

182
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,059
Not again. I've turned around
two times already.

183
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,352
So turn around again.

184
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:44,436
We're just gonna
keep turning around.

185
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,562
We're never gonna get anywhere.

186
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,689
Just stop the car.
We can't see out of the window.

187
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:49,942
I can't even fucking
hear myself think.

188
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:56,240
What the hell?

189
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:58,408
Holy shit.

190
00:10:58,492 --> 00:10:59,493
What is going on?

191
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:03,747
I think I'm gonna be sick.

192
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:05,874
Yeah.

193
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:13,382
Megan?

194
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:28,647
Are you guys seeing this?

195
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,067
It's all around us.

196
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:40,659
There's a name for this kind
of weather anomaly.

197
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:42,452
-Really?
-Yeah.

198
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:43,537
What is it?

199
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:46,456
I don't know. I don't remember.

200
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,292
It's cool, though.

201
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:52,129
Cool, weird, whatever it is,
we should probably just

202
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,797
get back in the car
and keep going home.

203
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:55,340
No way, dude.
I'm not driving through that

204
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:57,301
fucking storm again.
We gotta wait it out.

205
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,469
Or we could
just find another way.

206
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:01,096
Fuck.

207
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,348
Is anyone getting a signal?

208
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:05,100
I am.

209
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,063
A bad one.

210
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:11,398
Great.

211
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:12,983
Oh, you know what? Waterwall.

212
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,401
What?

213
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:17,237
I think it's called, like,
yeah, a waterwall.

214
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:19,656
That sounds made-up as hell.

215
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,034
No, that's what
the song is from.

216
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:23,118
What?

217
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:25,954
Maybe there's someone inside
that could tell us where we are.

218
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:28,248
-We can start making a plan.
-Yeah.

219
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:29,750
-All right.
-Good idea.

220
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:33,003
It's crazy.

221
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:49,353
Hello?

222
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,023
Hello?

223
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:59,238
Hello? Anyone here?

224
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:01,740
Damn.

225
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,993
Feels like we're
the first people here in years.

226
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:48,453
Yeah. Where is everyone?

227
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:06,847
Fun.

228
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:48,347
Clover?

229
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:55,938
Mel?

230
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:12,621
Clover!

231
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:15,624
Clover!

232
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:42,276
Clover!

233
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,403
Clover!

234
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:46,405
Clover!

235
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:49,241
Max?

236
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:22,983
Holy shit.

237
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:25,819
Clover.

238
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:27,654
Are you okay?

239
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,532
I thought I saw someone.

240
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:36,121
Okay, let's go inside. Okay?

241
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:02,231
Oh, shit.

242
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:04,191
"Oh, shit" what?

243
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:06,984
Look.

244
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,820
Oh, shit!

245
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,573
Guys.

246
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:14,242
You should see this.

247
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,496
There's no details on hers
or any of the others.

248
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,455
Like no date of birth,

249
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,790
no height and weight,
no last seen location,

250
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:23,502
not even a phone number to
contact if you have information.

251
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:24,962
So, what's the point, then?

252
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:28,674
I found something too.

253
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:40,978
"Glore Valley." This is it.

254
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:43,355
This is where Mel went missing.

255
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:45,983
That was her
I heard in the rain.

256
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,693
Wait, what? Look--

257
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:48,861
I'm so confused right now.

258
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:51,196
I heard someone call my name,
and it sounded like Mel.

259
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,240
But I didn't wanna
let myself believe that.

260
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:55,075
And then I come in here
and I see this.

261
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:57,578
Yeah, but, Clover,
it's weird, right?

262
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:00,247
I'm telling you it's her. Look.

263
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:03,166
Holy shit.

264
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,710
Yeah, I know.

265
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:07,462
Wait, did one of you guys
turn this over?

266
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:09,339
Max?

267
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:11,675
No. What does that
have to do with anything?

268
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:14,011
Because it wasn't
turned over before.

269
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,095
Wait.

270
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,097
Do you guys hear that?

271
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:18,182
Yeah.

272
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:28,317
Where's my car?

273
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:30,110
Shit.

274
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:39,912
Is that my fucking car?

275
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:45,876
Back inside.

276
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:47,503
Back inside. Go.

277
00:18:57,054 --> 00:18:58,096
Is he just gonna sit there?

278
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,224
Better question,
are we just gonna sit here?

279
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:01,350
Well, what else can we do?

280
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:02,935
Can we do a phone check again?

281
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:04,645
Nothing's been working
since we got here, though.

282
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:06,438
There has to be a phone
around here somewhere.

283
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:08,023
You wanna look for one,
go ahead.

284
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:10,150
Not taking my eyes off this guy.

285
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:27,543
Shit.

286
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:40,282
Why are there
windows underground?

287
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:45,329
You guys, there's a phone.

288
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:51,543
There's a dial tone.

289
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:53,754
It's okay. It's just somebody
fucking with us probably.

290
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:55,839
-It's gonna be fine.
-Yeah.

291
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:03,263
It's not working.

292
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:06,308
Unless...

293
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:08,393
Unless what?

294
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:12,898
Unless this is what happened to
Melanie before she went missing.

295
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:19,404
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

296
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:22,074
Hello?

297
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:27,329
Guys.

298
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,166
I'm gonna just check it out,
and I'll be right back.

299
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:32,835
Okay?

300
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:34,336
Okay.

301
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:42,052
Hello?

302
00:22:00,946 --> 00:22:01,947
Is anyone there?

303
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:11,999
Abe?

304
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:27,014
Abe?

305
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:44,990
Abe?

306
00:22:52,623 --> 00:22:53,624
Abe?

307
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:14,228
Is that Nina?

308
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:15,354
What the fuck?

309
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,611
-I'm gonna go check it out.
-Okay.

310
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:43,048
Go, go, go, go! Hide!
Go, go, go, go, go!

311
00:26:09,653 --> 00:26:10,654
Please.

312
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:01,496
Mel!

313
00:27:50,754 --> 00:27:51,755
Holy shit!

314
00:27:53,507 --> 00:27:54,716
How am I still alive right now?

315
00:27:55,551 --> 00:27:56,552
You were killed.

316
00:27:57,761 --> 00:27:58,762
I saw it.

317
00:28:00,472 --> 00:28:01,557
I died.

318
00:28:02,182 --> 00:28:03,183
He got you too?

319
00:28:05,978 --> 00:28:07,771
Wait. What about the others?

320
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:10,691
Let's go.

321
00:28:14,486 --> 00:28:15,487
Are you guys okay?

322
00:28:15,571 --> 00:28:17,406
-What just happened?
-We don't know.

323
00:28:17,948 --> 00:28:19,032
Megan. Hey.

324
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:21,451
Wait, where's Abe?

325
00:28:21,535 --> 00:28:23,328
-Abe?
-I'm back here.

326
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,915
I'm pretty sure
we're fucked, guys.

327
00:28:43,515 --> 00:28:44,892
Holy shit.

328
00:28:45,392 --> 00:28:46,685
It has a hold of us now.

329
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:49,354
What do you mean, "it"?

330
00:28:49,438 --> 00:28:50,814
I'm not sure.

331
00:28:51,315 --> 00:28:54,067
I just know that I can feel it,
stronger than before--

332
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:55,152
We need to get
the fuck out of here

333
00:28:55,235 --> 00:28:56,236
while we still have the chance.

334
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,155
No! No!
He could still be out there.

335
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:00,199
We didn't see anyone out there.
And the Jeep is back now.

336
00:29:00,282 --> 00:29:02,242
Perfect. Let's take it.
We need to go. Right now.

337
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:03,493
I don't think we can.

338
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:05,245
You don't know that.
None of us know anything.

339
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:08,498
Well, I know that
you were fucking murdered

340
00:29:08,582 --> 00:29:09,583
about ten minutes ago.

341
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:12,002
And I know that
because I saw it!

342
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:15,339
I saw it right before
I was fucking murdered!

343
00:29:15,422 --> 00:29:16,590
And now I'm here again,

344
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:19,384
and my name is in that fucking
book again just like Mel's,

345
00:29:19,468 --> 00:29:21,136
but who knows
what the fuck happened to her.

346
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,597
So the night
is just starting over again?

347
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,057
Like in whatever the fuck
that movie's called?

348
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,517
Like, that shit's actually real?

349
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,769
There's been a bunch of movies
about that, but like--

350
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:34,066
I don't remember
that happening last time.

351
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:36,652
So it's not like those movies.

352
00:29:37,236 --> 00:29:38,403
Good to know.

353
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:43,116
That didn't either.

354
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:44,743
Oh, fuck!

355
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:19,278
-Abe?
-Oh, shit!

356
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:22,531
Fuck.

357
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,931
Hey. Hey. Megan. Hey. You okay?

358
00:30:49,141 --> 00:30:50,142
Tonight feels different.

359
00:30:50,684 --> 00:30:51,727
What do you mean?

360
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:52,895
Worse.

361
00:30:52,978 --> 00:30:54,271
Fuck.

362
00:30:54,897 --> 00:30:56,690
Okay, okay. Well...

363
00:30:57,649 --> 00:30:59,359
Just so you know...

364
00:30:59,443 --> 00:31:01,737
you know the whole psychic thing

365
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,698
and you getting a signal
or whatever?

366
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:05,949
Totally believe you now.

367
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:10,746
Meg. Megan! Megan!

368
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:12,414
Megan!

369
00:31:12,497 --> 00:31:14,625
-Hey, Meg. Hey.
-Megan!

370
00:31:20,756 --> 00:31:22,132
What the fuck is happening?!

371
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:23,217
Megan?

372
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:26,386
-Megan?
-Where did Megan go?

373
00:31:26,845 --> 00:31:28,013
Megan?

374
00:31:28,096 --> 00:31:30,432
What the fuck?! Where is she?

375
00:31:30,516 --> 00:31:31,934
Where the fuck did she go?

376
00:31:34,645 --> 00:31:35,812
Listen.

377
00:32:20,691 --> 00:32:21,692
Meg?

378
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:24,570
Is someone there? Hello?

379
00:32:24,653 --> 00:32:27,614
Help! Please! Help me! Help!

380
00:32:27,698 --> 00:32:28,782
Who's there?

381
00:32:29,157 --> 00:32:32,703
This town was right to be
damned. We're all sinners here.

382
00:32:34,538 --> 00:32:38,208
Make it stop. I just wanna die.
Please. Please just let me die.

383
00:32:38,834 --> 00:32:40,127
Where's my mom?

384
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,795
Mommy?

385
00:32:41,879 --> 00:32:42,880
And then all of a sudden

386
00:32:42,963 --> 00:32:45,132
she started to attack me,
but it wasn't her.

387
00:32:45,215 --> 00:32:46,800
Nobody is coming for us.

388
00:32:46,884 --> 00:32:49,386
They're just gonna watch us die
over and over again.

389
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:51,221
Has anyone seen Tommy?

390
00:32:51,305 --> 00:32:53,307
My hair. My bones. Please.

391
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:55,017
It's what it's doing to us.

392
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,226
Can it just be over?

393
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,394
What we're becoming.

394
00:32:57,477 --> 00:32:59,396
I can't remember my own name.

395
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:00,689
Please just kill me.

396
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:02,649
I just want it to end.

397
00:33:07,738 --> 00:33:08,822
Don't let it in!

398
00:33:12,451 --> 00:33:14,369
Wait! I wouldn't touch her.
Don't touch her!

399
00:33:14,453 --> 00:33:16,038
-Why?!
-Because whatever just

400
00:33:16,121 --> 00:33:17,623
possessed her
might possess you next.

401
00:33:17,706 --> 00:33:19,249
That's not how possession works.

402
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:20,584
People can't get possessed
by contact.

403
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:22,878
You have to be, like,
weak of faith or something.

404
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:24,338
Oh, I have faith.
I have a lot of faith.

405
00:33:24,421 --> 00:33:25,464
Do you think it's still here,

406
00:33:25,547 --> 00:33:27,341
whatever got her,
whatever did this?

407
00:33:27,424 --> 00:33:28,509
I don't know.

408
00:33:28,592 --> 00:33:30,552
She said something was coming.

409
00:33:39,102 --> 00:33:40,479
Come on.

410
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:56,578
I don't see anyone out there.

411
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:02,251
Is anyone in there?

412
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:04,753
Melanie?

413
00:34:04,837 --> 00:34:06,880
Clover! Oh, my God, is that you?

414
00:34:07,756 --> 00:34:09,800
-Let me in. Please. Clover.
-Mel.

415
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:12,177
Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait.
Wait. Hold on. Hold on.

416
00:34:12,261 --> 00:34:13,469
Megan just said don't let it in.

417
00:34:13,554 --> 00:34:15,013
Please help me!

418
00:34:15,097 --> 00:34:16,348
-He's gonna kill me!
-Melanie.

419
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:17,516
No, wait.

420
00:34:18,391 --> 00:34:20,393
Something's hurting her!
We have to help her.

421
00:34:20,476 --> 00:34:21,645
We can't just stand here.

422
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:23,146
Mel!

423
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:24,940
Mel.

424
00:34:25,023 --> 00:34:26,024
Max.

425
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:28,277
Help!

426
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:35,701
Melanie.

427
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,331
What's that?

428
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:47,629
That house wasn't there before.

429
00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:53,092
Clover!

430
00:34:54,887 --> 00:34:55,971
Clover!

431
00:34:57,181 --> 00:34:58,182
Help!

432
00:34:59,266 --> 00:35:00,309
Help!

433
00:35:06,899 --> 00:35:08,442
Guys, please, help!

434
00:35:08,525 --> 00:35:10,652
Max. Are you okay?

435
00:35:15,741 --> 00:35:16,992
Clover!

436
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:21,705
No! No! No, no, no.

437
00:35:21,788 --> 00:35:24,082
No. No. No, no, no.

438
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:26,335
No, no, no!

439
00:35:27,002 --> 00:35:28,670
No!

440
00:35:43,727 --> 00:35:45,896
Fuck! Fuck!

441
00:35:52,819 --> 00:35:53,820
Clover!

442
00:35:53,904 --> 00:35:55,906
Wait a minute! Wait.
Just hold on, hold on.

443
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:57,157
What are you doing?

444
00:35:57,241 --> 00:35:58,825
-We need to go help Clover.
-Help her?

445
00:35:58,909 --> 00:36:00,911
Max, she's gone. She just flew
30 feet in the air.

446
00:36:00,994 --> 00:36:03,497
So we go and get her.
She can't be dead yet.

447
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,040
"Yet." You just said it.

448
00:36:05,123 --> 00:36:06,166
And she might be.
You don't even know.

449
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,335
I think our best move right now

450
00:36:08,418 --> 00:36:11,129
is leaving to go get help
like we originally said we'd do.

451
00:36:11,213 --> 00:36:12,798
Megan said
it won't let us leave.

452
00:36:12,881 --> 00:36:14,383
Megan just said
a lot of things, Max.

453
00:36:15,717 --> 00:36:16,802
Nina.

454
00:36:16,885 --> 00:36:18,679
Come on,
you can't be on board with this.

455
00:36:18,762 --> 00:36:20,222
I mean,
we're clearly dealing with

456
00:36:20,305 --> 00:36:21,765
some really
fucked-up shit here, Max.

457
00:36:21,849 --> 00:36:24,685
Shit that we're not,
like, equipped for.

458
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:26,687
But the only way we get through
fucked-up shit

459
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:28,605
is by sticking together.

460
00:36:29,231 --> 00:36:30,524
You said that.

461
00:36:31,483 --> 00:36:32,818
You said that.

462
00:36:34,361 --> 00:36:35,487
Oh, yeah. Okay.
You think this is what's

463
00:36:35,571 --> 00:36:37,114
gonna get her
to take you back or what?

464
00:36:37,197 --> 00:36:38,323
Abe!

465
00:36:42,703 --> 00:36:44,413
If you guys
do make it out of here,

466
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:46,957
you can both go
and fuck yourselves.

467
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,293
Wait, Max! Wait!

468
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:51,753
What the fuck?

469
00:36:51,837 --> 00:36:53,505
We're not leaving, Nina.
We're just going to get help.

470
00:36:53,589 --> 00:36:54,715
Why would you say that to him?

471
00:36:54,798 --> 00:36:55,883
Because he's going to get
himself killed

472
00:36:55,966 --> 00:36:56,967
right fuckin' now.

473
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,051
And, honestly, I don't know.

474
00:36:58,135 --> 00:36:59,344
It sounded like something
you would say.

475
00:36:59,428 --> 00:37:01,054
Yeah, but when I say
those things to them,

476
00:37:01,138 --> 00:37:02,598
they know that I don't mean it.

477
00:37:02,681 --> 00:37:04,308
Clover, Max, Megan,

478
00:37:04,391 --> 00:37:05,851
they're like
the only consistent people

479
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:07,102
that I've had in my life ever.

480
00:37:07,186 --> 00:37:08,645
I know. And you wanna
save them. Right?

481
00:37:09,563 --> 00:37:12,024
We can't save them
unless we save ourselves first.

482
00:37:12,357 --> 00:37:15,611
So, you think that
we could just drive

483
00:37:15,694 --> 00:37:16,695
out of here?
That it's that easy.

484
00:37:16,778 --> 00:37:17,821
I don't know.
But, you know what,

485
00:37:17,905 --> 00:37:20,991
we won't know
if we don't try. Okay?

486
00:37:21,074 --> 00:37:23,410
What I do know is that
if we just keep sitting here,

487
00:37:23,493 --> 00:37:25,412
something else very bad
is gonna happen to us.

488
00:37:28,749 --> 00:37:31,293
-So we try and get help.
-Yeah.

489
00:38:21,718 --> 00:38:23,053
Hello?

490
00:38:39,945 --> 00:38:41,238
Hello?

491
00:39:00,799 --> 00:39:02,926
...from the mine collapse
that tragically

492
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:05,554
struck the town
just two days ago.

493
00:39:06,263 --> 00:39:08,682
There are still no confirmed
number of casualties

494
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:11,393
but officials
are fearing the worst.

495
00:39:49,348 --> 00:39:50,390
No.

496
00:39:51,725 --> 00:39:53,894
Please let me out. Please.

497
00:39:54,394 --> 00:39:55,604
I want out.

498
00:39:55,687 --> 00:39:57,397
Only one way out.

499
00:39:57,481 --> 00:40:01,777
You either survive the night
or become a part of it.

500
00:40:06,865 --> 00:40:09,326
Please let me out.
Please let me out.

501
00:40:12,162 --> 00:40:13,247
No.

502
00:40:13,372 --> 00:40:16,124
No. No. No. No!

503
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:18,210
No! No!

504
00:40:18,293 --> 00:40:19,503
Suffer.

505
00:40:20,128 --> 00:40:23,048
Suffer like the rest
of this cursed town.

506
00:40:24,091 --> 00:40:26,927
Suffer until hell opens up

507
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:29,346
and swallows you too.

508
00:40:57,124 --> 00:40:58,250
Fuck.

509
00:41:02,671 --> 00:41:03,922
Clover?

510
00:41:15,976 --> 00:41:18,187
Wait, I can't do this.
I can't leave my friends.

511
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:19,521
-Nina, baby. We have to go.
-No.

512
00:41:20,606 --> 00:41:22,149
-I don't wanna leave my friends.
-No. Nina, no.

513
00:41:22,232 --> 00:41:24,610
What are you doing?
Unlock the door!

514
00:41:26,737 --> 00:41:27,988
We have to go.
We're going to get help.

515
00:41:28,071 --> 00:41:29,156
Abe, unlock the-- No, Abe!

516
00:41:33,202 --> 00:41:34,745
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

517
00:41:38,207 --> 00:41:40,459
What is that? What is that?

518
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:42,085
-What is that?
-I have no idea!

519
00:41:42,669 --> 00:41:43,670
Oh, my God.

520
00:41:43,754 --> 00:41:44,838
Go!

521
00:41:44,922 --> 00:41:45,923
Go!

522
00:41:54,515 --> 00:41:56,099
My door's still locked.

523
00:41:56,183 --> 00:41:57,434
My door is locked!

524
00:42:03,899 --> 00:42:05,108
Abe?

525
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:13,867
Clover.

526
00:42:55,158 --> 00:42:56,451
Clover?

527
00:44:55,904 --> 00:44:57,030
Fucking clowns.

528
00:44:58,949 --> 00:45:00,492
Whoa! Fuck!

529
00:45:00,576 --> 00:45:01,618
Clover?

530
00:46:05,891 --> 00:46:07,476
I guess we died again.

531
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:08,602
Yeah.

532
00:46:10,187 --> 00:46:12,356
Is this just
gonna keep happening?

533
00:46:13,398 --> 00:46:14,399
I don't know.

534
00:46:53,397 --> 00:46:56,692
"Survive the night,
or become a part of it."

535
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:04,032
There's no water--

536
00:47:06,326 --> 00:47:07,327
What?

537
00:47:15,752 --> 00:47:16,753
Anyone else?

538
00:47:17,588 --> 00:47:18,630
Please.

539
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:23,135
Okay.

540
00:47:23,886 --> 00:47:26,388
So you're sure
that's what she said

541
00:47:26,847 --> 00:47:29,224
about surviving?

542
00:47:29,641 --> 00:47:31,810
And it was like
a for-real witch?

543
00:47:32,603 --> 00:47:35,480
I think it was a for-real witch.

544
00:47:37,065 --> 00:47:38,066
I mean...

545
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:40,485
Yeah, I think
that's what she said.

546
00:47:41,945 --> 00:47:43,864
That's like the only thing
I can remember.

547
00:47:45,532 --> 00:47:46,575
Well...

548
00:47:47,451 --> 00:47:50,162
The good news is that I think
this means there's a way out.

549
00:47:52,372 --> 00:47:53,498
What's that?

550
00:47:56,168 --> 00:47:57,753
"Survive the night."

551
00:47:57,836 --> 00:48:00,589
Right? So, maybe
if we can make it until dawn,

552
00:48:00,672 --> 00:48:02,466
then maybe this will be over.

553
00:48:02,549 --> 00:48:04,259
Okay, but what about the rest?

554
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,637
"Or become a part of it."

555
00:48:07,137 --> 00:48:09,181
Yeah, part of the night, right?

556
00:48:09,264 --> 00:48:10,974
It means that
if we don't get out,

557
00:48:11,058 --> 00:48:12,226
we're stuck here forever.

558
00:48:12,309 --> 00:48:17,231
And shit like this and that
will just keep happening.

559
00:48:17,731 --> 00:48:19,691
We're turning
into something else.

560
00:48:20,567 --> 00:48:22,069
You guys get that, right?

561
00:48:22,444 --> 00:48:25,113
Okay, so we'll just
stick it out in here

562
00:48:25,197 --> 00:48:27,032
until the sun comes up,
like Max said.

563
00:48:27,741 --> 00:48:28,909
But what about Mel?

564
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,578
She's still stuck here
too somewhere.

565
00:48:31,662 --> 00:48:33,705
If Mel was still stuck,
then she would be here.

566
00:48:33,789 --> 00:48:35,290
And all those people
on that wall,

567
00:48:35,374 --> 00:48:37,709
they would be here,
and they're not, so...

568
00:48:38,919 --> 00:48:40,629
-Where are they?
-Oh, my God.

569
00:48:41,129 --> 00:48:43,966
We didn't come here
looking for Mel, okay, Clover?

570
00:48:44,049 --> 00:48:46,301
We came hoping
to find you again.

571
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:48,262
Like, the old you.

572
00:48:48,345 --> 00:48:50,556
We were hoping this
would help you move on.

573
00:48:51,056 --> 00:48:53,183
Help you get back to,
you know, living.

574
00:48:57,938 --> 00:48:59,022
Abe.

575
00:48:59,565 --> 00:49:01,316
-Are you okay?
-Here, take some.

576
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:04,111
Abe.

577
00:49:08,156 --> 00:49:09,408
Holy fuck!

578
00:49:13,328 --> 00:49:14,913
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

579
00:49:15,289 --> 00:49:17,708
It's in my mouth!
It's in my mouth!

580
00:49:19,001 --> 00:49:20,586
Nina! Stop! The water.

581
00:49:21,712 --> 00:49:23,672
-You saw him drink the water.
-Didn't we all drink the wat--?

582
00:49:27,342 --> 00:49:29,052
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

583
00:49:38,437 --> 00:49:39,771
-What do we do?
-I don't know.

584
00:49:39,855 --> 00:49:41,732
I need a second to think.
That was a lot.

585
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:45,861
Meg?

586
00:49:46,445 --> 00:49:47,446
No.

587
00:49:48,197 --> 00:49:49,198
Meg?

588
00:49:49,281 --> 00:49:51,200
-Megan?
-No, no, no. Please.

589
00:49:51,283 --> 00:49:52,492
Please. No.

590
00:49:55,037 --> 00:49:56,121
Megan.

591
00:50:02,461 --> 00:50:04,087
-What do we do, Max?
-I don't know.

592
00:50:17,851 --> 00:50:18,977
Oh, my God.

593
00:50:22,523 --> 00:50:23,899
I don't know what to do.

594
00:50:23,982 --> 00:50:24,983
Help me.

595
00:50:25,067 --> 00:50:26,860
Megan. What do we do?

596
00:50:27,611 --> 00:50:28,612
Megan.

597
00:50:35,118 --> 00:50:36,119
Kill me, Max.

598
00:50:37,162 --> 00:50:39,039
What? No!

599
00:50:39,122 --> 00:50:41,124
Please.
All of our friends are dead.

600
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:42,501
And we drank the water,

601
00:50:42,584 --> 00:50:44,169
and we're covered
in the same shit they were.

602
00:50:44,253 --> 00:50:47,464
No, we need to start over
and come up with a plan.

603
00:50:47,548 --> 00:50:49,675
Look. The sand
has almost run out.

604
00:50:49,758 --> 00:50:52,803
It's almost dawn.
Okay? And maybe we'll survive.

605
00:50:52,886 --> 00:50:56,473
We'll come back. Okay? Okay?
It's only been twice so far.

606
00:50:56,557 --> 00:50:58,350
And you saw the other signatures
in the book.

607
00:50:58,433 --> 00:50:59,810
Everyone else has way more.

608
00:51:00,686 --> 00:51:01,895
We'll come back.

609
00:51:02,312 --> 00:51:04,064
We need to try and save them.

610
00:51:10,988 --> 00:51:14,783
Please do it. Please hurry.
Max, hurry.

611
00:51:19,037 --> 00:51:20,247
I can't! I can't.

612
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:21,331
Max, no.

613
00:51:21,415 --> 00:51:22,958
I can't. I'm sorry.

614
00:51:58,577 --> 00:51:59,745
You?

615
00:52:02,164 --> 00:52:04,499
You almost made it.

616
00:52:04,583 --> 00:52:05,959
Almost!

617
00:52:06,251 --> 00:52:08,462
But not quite.

618
00:52:08,545 --> 00:52:13,884
You don't survive
by sitting still, Miss Clover.

619
00:52:18,263 --> 00:52:19,389
What?

620
00:52:56,844 --> 00:52:58,303
Is anyone else
growing new teeth?

621
00:52:59,096 --> 00:53:00,764
Wait, how many
are we supposed to have?

622
00:53:00,848 --> 00:53:02,224
I don't know,
but it's an even number.

623
00:53:04,476 --> 00:53:07,980
Guys, clearly it doesn't work
to just wait it out.

624
00:53:08,063 --> 00:53:09,064
I mean, there has to be

625
00:53:09,147 --> 00:53:10,816
something here
to help us come up with a plan.

626
00:53:20,409 --> 00:53:22,494
Holy fuck. This is the guy.

627
00:53:22,953 --> 00:53:26,373
This is... Yeah, this is the guy
from the gas station. Look!

628
00:53:26,456 --> 00:53:28,083
-What?
-He's Dr Alan Hill.

629
00:53:28,834 --> 00:53:31,170
He's, like, somehow
connected to this place.

630
00:53:31,253 --> 00:53:33,088
Why? What's so special about it?

631
00:53:33,172 --> 00:53:35,465
Twenty years ago
there was a mining disaster.

632
00:53:35,549 --> 00:53:37,259
Happened right here
in Glore Valley.

633
00:53:40,012 --> 00:53:41,471
"Working with outside engineers,

634
00:53:41,555 --> 00:53:42,806
"investigators confirmed
the destruction

635
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:44,516
"was caused by boring
too deep into the earth

636
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:45,976
"and too far under the town,

637
00:53:46,059 --> 00:53:48,187
"resulting in the death
of over 1,100 people.

638
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:50,355
"Dr Alan Hill,
a trauma specialist,

639
00:53:50,439 --> 00:53:52,733
"was brought in
to work with the survivors."

640
00:53:53,859 --> 00:53:56,528
The whole town got, like,
swallowed up by the earth.

641
00:53:59,531 --> 00:54:01,783
That's why there's
no other houses here.

642
00:54:01,867 --> 00:54:03,619
And that's why
there's windows down here.

643
00:54:04,119 --> 00:54:05,787
This whole floor
used to be above ground.

644
00:54:07,539 --> 00:54:08,624
That means
that's the front door.

645
00:54:08,957 --> 00:54:10,417
Guys, who gives a shit?

646
00:54:10,501 --> 00:54:11,502
I feel like we really need

647
00:54:11,585 --> 00:54:12,628
to just be getting
weapons right now.

648
00:54:12,711 --> 00:54:14,296
Okay, but I think we need more

649
00:54:14,379 --> 00:54:15,631
than just weapons
of brute force.

650
00:54:15,714 --> 00:54:16,715
Like what, Max?

651
00:54:31,355 --> 00:54:32,356
No, thank you.

652
00:54:32,814 --> 00:54:34,608
I think we need the Bible
as a weapon.

653
00:54:34,691 --> 00:54:36,902
Yeah, dude, not against
a masked maniac, though.

654
00:54:36,985 --> 00:54:38,612
But we're not just up
against that psycho.

655
00:54:39,029 --> 00:54:40,906
Every single night something new
is trying to kill us.

656
00:54:40,989 --> 00:54:42,491
Yeah, but why?

657
00:54:43,951 --> 00:54:45,077
Think about it.

658
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,538
If it was the same thing
over and over again,

659
00:54:47,621 --> 00:54:49,456
you'd become
less scared over time.

660
00:54:50,707 --> 00:54:54,086
But what's more terrifying than
not knowing what comes next.

661
00:54:54,837 --> 00:54:55,838
Whoever,

662
00:54:56,421 --> 00:54:57,631
whatever,

663
00:54:57,714 --> 00:54:58,924
is doing this...

664
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:01,343
it wants to keep us afraid.

665
00:55:01,426 --> 00:55:02,803
Yeah, well, it's working.

666
00:55:04,638 --> 00:55:05,848
I think I found something.

667
00:55:05,931 --> 00:55:08,016
I don't think that's gonna
help us. A VHS tape?

668
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,560
Knowledge is power.

669
00:55:16,108 --> 00:55:17,526
Great, that's exactly
what we need

670
00:55:17,609 --> 00:55:18,610
-right now.
-Wow.

671
00:55:19,111 --> 00:55:20,112
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

672
00:55:20,195 --> 00:55:21,488
Very powerful, Max. Thank you.

673
00:55:21,572 --> 00:55:22,823
Just give me a second.
I have another one.

674
00:55:22,906 --> 00:55:24,992
Do you want us
to leave you alone for a second?

675
00:55:25,075 --> 00:55:26,702
-Just shut up. Abe.
-All right, all right.

676
00:55:55,939 --> 00:55:56,982
Please.

677
00:55:58,233 --> 00:56:01,528
What are you doing to me?
Why do I keep coming back?

678
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:06,491
Why do you have these things
that keep killing me?

679
00:56:07,159 --> 00:56:08,202
Who are you?!

680
00:56:08,785 --> 00:56:10,913
What do you want from me?! Huh?

681
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:18,670
The patient showed signs of
starvation and muscle atrophy.

682
00:56:18,754 --> 00:56:19,838
What's happening to me?

683
00:56:19,922 --> 00:56:24,176
But most importantly,
intense fear, anxiety,

684
00:56:24,259 --> 00:56:27,596
feelings of hopelessness
and utter despair.

685
00:56:28,722 --> 00:56:32,017
Fortunately for my experiments,

686
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:35,562
the trauma of the mining
disaster still lingers,

687
00:56:35,646 --> 00:56:39,525
affecting both survivors
and visitors.

688
00:56:44,404 --> 00:56:46,240
The longer he was trapped here,

689
00:56:46,323 --> 00:56:49,409
the more desperate
and afraid he became...

690
00:56:49,493 --> 00:56:52,287
and also the more monstrous.

691
00:56:56,166 --> 00:56:57,376
Help! God, please!

692
00:56:57,459 --> 00:57:02,339
Eleven nights. That's the most
in my experiments so far.

693
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:11,306
Soon, those emotions
began to affect his body

694
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:13,767
in more interesting ways,

695
00:57:15,435 --> 00:57:18,480
transforming into
a creature known

696
00:57:18,564 --> 00:57:20,399
as the Wendigo.

697
00:57:20,482 --> 00:57:23,402
It is no coincidence
that in psychology,

698
00:57:23,485 --> 00:57:26,572
the Wendigo represents
extreme hunger,

699
00:57:26,655 --> 00:57:29,074
extreme want.

700
00:57:35,747 --> 00:57:37,249
That's what's happening to us.

701
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:39,251
That's what we're becoming.

702
00:57:39,835 --> 00:57:40,919
Yeah.

703
00:57:42,337 --> 00:57:44,089
Now you're getting it.

704
00:57:47,843 --> 00:57:49,178
Let us out.

705
00:57:53,807 --> 00:57:55,142
Let us out!

706
00:57:55,225 --> 00:57:57,644
Oh, there's a way out,

707
00:57:57,728 --> 00:58:00,189
but not without a price.

708
00:58:01,481 --> 00:58:03,192
-Ask him how.
-Abe!

709
00:58:04,109 --> 00:58:05,110
How?

710
00:58:05,194 --> 00:58:08,197
Someone always has to die.

711
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:12,201
Four of you can leave,
but one has to die.

712
00:58:12,284 --> 00:58:13,493
No.

713
00:58:13,827 --> 00:58:14,828
Nice try, asshole.

714
00:58:14,912 --> 00:58:17,080
Wait, hold on. I think we should
at least just hear him out.

715
00:58:17,164 --> 00:58:20,083
Why? Are you willing
to sacrifice yourself for us?

716
00:58:22,419 --> 00:58:23,504
No.

717
00:58:23,587 --> 00:58:24,880
We can't trust this guy.

718
00:58:24,963 --> 00:58:26,298
Which means our only real shot

719
00:58:26,381 --> 00:58:27,925
of getting out
of here is getting some answers,

720
00:58:28,008 --> 00:58:29,593
and the one
with the answers is Hill.

721
00:58:30,761 --> 00:58:33,263
He's here somewhere.
I can feel it.

722
00:59:04,294 --> 00:59:07,506
How is this supposed to help us?
The whole town was destroyed.

723
00:59:07,589 --> 00:59:08,674
He could be anywhere.

724
00:59:11,593 --> 00:59:12,719
No. Not "anywhere."

725
00:59:17,307 --> 00:59:18,308
He's there.

726
00:59:18,392 --> 00:59:19,476
Was there. And Nina just said

727
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:20,936
none of this even
exists any more.

728
00:59:21,019 --> 00:59:23,438
So we just need to try
to get him out of hiding.

729
00:59:24,857 --> 00:59:26,400
I wanna see you. Face-to-face.

730
00:59:26,483 --> 00:59:28,110
Clover, what are you doing?

731
00:59:28,485 --> 00:59:30,112
He's the key to all of this.

732
00:59:30,195 --> 00:59:31,822
That can be arranged.

733
00:59:32,447 --> 00:59:35,409
But just you, Clover.
Not your friends.

734
00:59:35,492 --> 00:59:36,785
-No.
-Clover, no.

735
00:59:36,869 --> 00:59:39,162
This is a trap,
just like everything else here.

736
00:59:39,246 --> 00:59:40,455
Actually, I think
it's a pretty good idea.

737
00:59:40,539 --> 00:59:42,124
Abe, just shut
the fuck up, okay?

738
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:43,458
It's only night four. Clover,

739
00:59:43,542 --> 00:59:45,252
-you're gonna have more chances.
-We don't know that.

740
00:59:45,377 --> 00:59:47,296
All the other signatures
in the book go way past that.

741
00:59:47,379 --> 00:59:48,881
Guys, Abe is right.

742
00:59:49,882 --> 00:59:52,342
-This is our chance.
-No. Don't listen to him.

743
00:59:52,426 --> 00:59:54,219
I'm out in the woods.

744
00:59:54,303 --> 00:59:56,471
I'm here with your sister.

745
00:59:57,890 --> 00:59:59,850
I might just let you see her.

746
01:00:00,142 --> 01:00:01,768
-Clo.
-There you go. Yeah.

747
01:00:01,852 --> 01:00:03,437
-Clover, come on.
-No.

748
01:00:04,354 --> 01:00:05,606
I have to try.

749
01:00:05,689 --> 01:00:07,232
-No, no, no. Clover!
-Let her go!

750
01:00:07,316 --> 01:00:08,984
-Back off!
-Let her go, let her go!

751
01:00:09,067 --> 01:00:11,820
-What is wrong with you?
-What? Hey!

752
01:00:11,904 --> 01:00:13,697
Hey! Nina!

753
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:18,118
You fucking prick!

754
01:00:18,202 --> 01:00:20,120
What?! I didn't think
she was gonna actually do it.

755
01:00:20,204 --> 01:00:21,622
Yes, you did. You knew she would

756
01:00:21,705 --> 01:00:23,457
and you took advantage.
Fucking coward!

757
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:25,042
Look, Megan,
we need to find Clover

758
01:00:25,125 --> 01:00:26,126
before something
permanent happens.

759
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:27,753
-To do what?
-We're gonna go and find her.

760
01:00:27,836 --> 01:00:29,046
And if she's dead already,

761
01:00:29,129 --> 01:00:32,925
we're gonna kill each other
and start over again.

762
01:00:33,008 --> 01:00:34,134
Sounds like a plan.

763
01:00:34,218 --> 01:00:35,219
Abe first.

764
01:00:35,302 --> 01:00:37,262
Wait-Wait! Just wait, hold on.

765
01:00:37,346 --> 01:00:38,889
Say we start over.

766
01:00:38,972 --> 01:00:40,182
What then?

767
01:00:41,016 --> 01:00:43,268
We just keep running away
until we run out of chances?

768
01:00:43,352 --> 01:00:44,561
Are you fucking serious?

769
01:00:44,645 --> 01:00:46,063
I don't wanna live
knowing that I'm alive

770
01:00:46,146 --> 01:00:47,648
because someone else is dead!

771
01:00:47,731 --> 01:00:49,733
-Because Clover is dead!
-But look at us!

772
01:00:49,816 --> 01:00:52,528
How many more deaths
do you have in you? Be honest.

773
01:00:53,153 --> 01:00:55,906
I mean, didn't she try and kill
herself twice last year?

774
01:00:56,198 --> 01:00:58,534
Isn't this just giving her
what she wa--?

775
01:01:06,291 --> 01:01:08,043
What the fuck, Nina?!

776
01:01:08,669 --> 01:01:09,962
You guys go find Clover.

777
01:01:10,629 --> 01:01:12,214
Otherwise it'll be two people
we have to leave behind.

778
01:01:12,631 --> 01:01:13,674
Let's go.

779
01:01:23,141 --> 01:01:24,935
You better hope they find her.

780
01:01:30,774 --> 01:01:31,900
I'm here!

781
01:01:32,943 --> 01:01:33,986
You have me.

782
01:01:43,912 --> 01:01:45,038
No.

783
01:01:58,552 --> 01:01:59,678
Oh, no.

784
01:02:00,179 --> 01:02:03,807
No, please, please, please.
Please! Sh-- Please.

785
01:02:04,474 --> 01:02:05,893
No, no. No!

786
01:02:05,976 --> 01:02:09,730
Please! Please! Please! Please!

787
01:02:09,813 --> 01:02:10,814
Please!

788
01:02:11,773 --> 01:02:14,693
No! Wait, wait!
Oh, my God.

789
01:02:25,454 --> 01:02:27,581
You need to try
and survive, Nina.

790
01:02:29,333 --> 01:02:30,626
I will.

791
01:02:31,793 --> 01:02:33,128
Just not this time.

792
01:02:48,685 --> 01:02:50,854
I'm scared of dying, Nina.

793
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:53,148
Like, really dying.

794
01:02:54,316 --> 01:02:55,526
Me too.

795
01:02:57,528 --> 01:03:00,322
But living without my friends
scares me even more.

796
01:03:05,202 --> 01:03:06,495
Him first.

797
01:03:06,912 --> 01:03:07,913
What?

798
01:03:14,378 --> 01:03:15,546
Clover!

799
01:03:16,046 --> 01:03:17,172
Clo!

800
01:03:28,934 --> 01:03:30,477
Holy shit.

801
01:03:43,824 --> 01:03:44,867
Clover?

802
01:03:46,034 --> 01:03:47,286
Clover!

803
01:03:49,663 --> 01:03:50,914
Clover!

804
01:04:01,258 --> 01:04:02,426
Over there.

805
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:11,185
The hell?

806
01:04:13,103 --> 01:04:14,271
Run!

807
01:04:22,821 --> 01:04:24,448
Max! Max!

808
01:04:29,912 --> 01:04:31,079
It'll break if I move.

809
01:04:33,957 --> 01:04:35,626
Okay, okay.
Just give me your hand.

810
01:04:38,837 --> 01:04:42,007
Okay, okay, I got you.
I'm gonna pull on three. Okay?

811
01:04:43,175 --> 01:04:44,176
Okay.

812
01:04:44,259 --> 01:04:45,969
One, two, three.

813
01:04:51,975 --> 01:04:52,976
Meg!

814
01:04:53,685 --> 01:04:54,686
Meg!

815
01:05:33,225 --> 01:05:34,726
Clover! Clover!

816
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:35,811
Max!

817
01:05:35,894 --> 01:05:37,437
You're here.

818
01:05:37,521 --> 01:05:40,190
I got you. I got you.
Okay. Ready?

819
01:05:42,109 --> 01:05:43,110
Okay.

820
01:05:45,362 --> 01:05:47,364
I'm sorry. Aw, fuck.

821
01:05:50,117 --> 01:05:51,368
Max. Max. Max.

822
01:05:56,874 --> 01:05:57,875
Is that Melanie?

823
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:12,973
-Come on. Come on.
-Melanie! No, no!

824
01:06:19,229 --> 01:06:20,355
I got you. I got you.

825
01:06:34,912 --> 01:06:35,913
Melanie!

826
01:06:42,085 --> 01:06:43,712
I fucked up, Max.

827
01:06:44,713 --> 01:06:45,714
What?

828
01:06:45,797 --> 01:06:47,007
-I fucked up.
-No.

829
01:06:47,090 --> 01:06:48,759
-Yes. Yes. Yes.
-No, no, no.

830
01:06:49,426 --> 01:06:50,427
Yeah.

831
01:06:52,763 --> 01:06:54,556
Why did you come for me?

832
01:06:55,891 --> 01:06:56,892
You all could have escaped.

833
01:06:57,684 --> 01:07:00,729
No. No, no, no. We'll have
more chances to get out of this.

834
01:07:01,647 --> 01:07:03,273
Okay? Together.

835
01:07:05,234 --> 01:07:07,152
I'm not leaving you behind.

836
01:07:15,619 --> 01:07:16,787
When we die, like...

837
01:07:17,913 --> 01:07:19,081
for real...

838
01:07:20,332 --> 01:07:22,459
you think we get the chance
to do it all again?

839
01:07:25,295 --> 01:07:26,588
I hope not.

840
01:07:27,673 --> 01:07:28,715
Why?

841
01:07:31,718 --> 01:07:33,762
Just means more somehow

842
01:07:34,555 --> 01:07:36,306
when you know
you only have one shot.

843
01:07:40,102 --> 01:07:41,103
Yeah.

844
01:07:45,607 --> 01:07:47,317
Are the others still alive?

845
01:07:48,068 --> 01:07:50,112
I'm not sure about Abe and Nina.

846
01:07:50,195 --> 01:07:51,196
What about Megan?

847
01:07:59,663 --> 01:08:01,623
What are you doing? I just said
I don't know about Abe and Nina.

848
01:08:01,707 --> 01:08:02,958
But we know that Megan is dead.

849
01:08:03,041 --> 01:08:05,294
That's enough
for me to try and start again.

850
01:08:08,172 --> 01:08:10,048
This next one might be our last.

851
01:08:12,217 --> 01:08:14,178
But I think
we can all survive, Max.

852
01:08:14,261 --> 01:08:17,471
So let's get started
by dying first.

853
01:08:17,555 --> 01:08:20,475
I know. I know. It's okay.

854
01:08:25,397 --> 01:08:26,398
Yeah.

855
01:08:32,362 --> 01:08:33,363
Thank you.

856
01:09:05,437 --> 01:09:06,438
Hey!

857
01:09:07,648 --> 01:09:08,774
Fuck y--!

858
01:09:19,993 --> 01:09:21,453
Just one second, Mel.

859
01:09:27,542 --> 01:09:29,586
Mel. Mel.

860
01:09:30,962 --> 01:09:33,215
Wait, hey. You should take this.

861
01:09:33,298 --> 01:09:34,299
No, Clover.

862
01:09:34,383 --> 01:09:35,551
It was Mom's.
You should take it.

863
01:09:35,634 --> 01:09:37,803
No. You keep it.

864
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:41,390
Well, do you wanna
wait out the storm at least?

865
01:09:41,473 --> 01:09:44,852
I just wanna get going.
It's a long way to New York.

866
01:09:46,478 --> 01:09:48,063
But then it's just me.

867
01:09:48,564 --> 01:09:49,689
Yeah.

868
01:09:49,773 --> 01:09:53,026
I mean, I've asked you to come
with me how many times now?

869
01:09:53,777 --> 01:09:54,778
Let's just leave.

870
01:09:55,445 --> 01:09:57,281
I told you that I can't.

871
01:09:57,364 --> 01:09:59,616
You can't sit still
for the rest of your life, Clo.

872
01:10:00,284 --> 01:10:01,285
It's not living.

873
01:10:02,035 --> 01:10:03,203
At least I'm not running away.

874
01:10:03,787 --> 01:10:05,539
You think that's what I'm doing,
running away?

875
01:10:05,622 --> 01:10:06,999
I'm actually running
towards something.

876
01:10:07,082 --> 01:10:08,250
Towards what?

877
01:10:08,333 --> 01:10:11,837
School. A new city. A new life.

878
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:12,921
I love you.

879
01:10:14,256 --> 01:10:15,883
But I can't just sit here

880
01:10:15,966 --> 01:10:18,051
and waste away
becoming something I'd hate.

881
01:10:28,729 --> 01:10:29,730
Mel.

882
01:10:30,731 --> 01:10:32,232
Mel, wait!

883
01:10:38,071 --> 01:10:40,240
Hey. Hey.
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

884
01:10:46,455 --> 01:10:48,207
I had to drag you in here.

885
01:10:49,249 --> 01:10:50,542
I thought we lost you.

886
01:10:51,877 --> 01:10:52,878
Hey.

887
01:10:52,961 --> 01:10:54,129
Is there...?

888
01:10:55,005 --> 01:10:56,423
Is there something on my back?

889
01:11:02,471 --> 01:11:04,223
-You look fine.
-Are you sure?

890
01:11:05,057 --> 01:11:06,808
It feels like there's
something back there.

891
01:11:16,902 --> 01:11:18,445
How long have we been here?

892
01:11:20,113 --> 01:11:23,492
I don't know.
Three or four nights, I think.

893
01:11:24,076 --> 01:11:25,160
Five, actually.

894
01:11:25,869 --> 01:11:26,870
It's been five.

895
01:11:26,954 --> 01:11:28,121
No, not five.

896
01:11:29,164 --> 01:11:30,999
-Thirteen.
-What?

897
01:11:31,083 --> 01:11:32,584
It's been 13 nights.

898
01:11:34,127 --> 01:11:35,420
Go check the book.

899
01:11:54,982 --> 01:11:56,441
Yeah, nobody has more than 13.

900
01:11:59,945 --> 01:12:01,321
Tonight might be
our last chance.

901
01:12:16,086 --> 01:12:18,297
I don't remember
any of these things.

902
01:12:19,673 --> 01:12:21,175
Yeah, me neither.

903
01:12:22,134 --> 01:12:23,802
We didn't do what we said, Max.

904
01:12:25,012 --> 01:12:27,598
The next one wasn't the last and
neither was the one after that,

905
01:12:27,681 --> 01:12:29,016
or the one after that.

906
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:38,984
Wait.

907
01:12:40,485 --> 01:12:41,486
Where's Megan?

908
01:12:45,324 --> 01:12:46,658
Shit. Megan.

909
01:12:52,331 --> 01:12:53,832
She's not in there.

910
01:12:53,916 --> 01:12:55,459
Maybe something
already happened to her?

911
01:12:55,542 --> 01:12:57,419
Or it got to her first.

912
01:12:57,503 --> 01:12:58,587
What? What got to her?

913
01:12:59,296 --> 01:13:00,506
The night.

914
01:13:02,508 --> 01:13:05,719
Survive the night
or become a part of it.

915
01:13:06,595 --> 01:13:07,804
There's nothing that says
it would happen

916
01:13:07,888 --> 01:13:08,889
to all of us at the same time.

917
01:13:08,972 --> 01:13:11,141
Because there's nothing
that says anything, Abe.

918
01:13:11,225 --> 01:13:12,309
I know, but different people
could have

919
01:13:12,392 --> 01:13:13,393
a different number of chances,

920
01:13:13,477 --> 01:13:14,478
like it's random.

921
01:13:15,187 --> 01:13:16,188
You could be right.

922
01:13:17,189 --> 01:13:20,609
Okay. Okay, great.
So then what do we do, huh?

923
01:13:21,109 --> 01:13:22,861
Megan is just-- She's gone?

924
01:13:23,695 --> 01:13:26,323
Fuck. Why can't we
remember anything?

925
01:13:26,406 --> 01:13:27,908
Why didn't we write
anything down?

926
01:13:27,991 --> 01:13:29,284
Would it have mattered?

927
01:13:29,368 --> 01:13:31,203
It'd be gone once
the night starts over anyway.

928
01:13:31,286 --> 01:13:34,122
-Your signature isn't.
-But that's all that's in there.

929
01:13:34,873 --> 01:13:36,291
Didn't I record something?

930
01:13:40,963 --> 01:13:42,297
Holy shit. Guys, come here.

931
01:13:49,263 --> 01:13:50,264
Look.

932
01:13:51,098 --> 01:13:52,432
There's so much stuff.

933
01:13:53,767 --> 01:13:54,852
What?

934
01:13:54,935 --> 01:13:56,436
Okay. All right.

935
01:13:58,397 --> 01:14:00,190
Don't worry. We'll get it.

936
01:14:00,274 --> 01:14:01,275
Okay.

937
01:14:01,358 --> 01:14:02,442
Just don't move.
I'm gonna grab it.

938
01:14:02,526 --> 01:14:03,569
-Oh, my God.
-Okay.

939
01:14:03,652 --> 01:14:06,029
Abe? Abe, be careful.

940
01:14:06,113 --> 01:14:07,573
-Please get it.
-Abe?

941
01:14:08,323 --> 01:14:09,366
What?

942
01:14:09,950 --> 01:14:11,535
Is it gone?

943
01:14:12,452 --> 01:14:13,453
Is it gone?

944
01:14:14,746 --> 01:14:16,123
Yeah. It's gone.

945
01:14:16,707 --> 01:14:18,041
Did it fall off?

946
01:14:20,544 --> 01:14:21,753
-What the fuck?!
-What?

947
01:14:22,254 --> 01:14:23,505
-Holy shit.
-Is it still on my face?

948
01:14:25,549 --> 01:14:28,343
-It's fine, it's fine.
-Clover, it's okay, it's okay.

949
01:14:28,886 --> 01:14:30,387
Is it still on my face?!

950
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:31,471
Oh, my God.

951
01:14:37,603 --> 01:14:39,188
Fuck. It's locked.

952
01:14:39,271 --> 01:14:40,397
Fuck.

953
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:41,481
What's that?

954
01:14:42,774 --> 01:14:45,402
What the fuck?
What the fuck is that?

955
01:14:45,485 --> 01:14:46,528
Is that a person?

956
01:14:46,612 --> 01:14:48,822
Holy shit, holy shit.
What the fuck?!

957
01:14:50,824 --> 01:14:52,576
Max. We should turn back.

958
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:02,544
Look at all this shit.

959
01:15:03,712 --> 01:15:05,005
There's fucking blood
on the walls.

960
01:15:05,088 --> 01:15:06,131
Just be quiet, Abe.

961
01:15:10,552 --> 01:15:11,762
What the hell?

962
01:15:15,057 --> 01:15:16,058
Max!

963
01:15:17,809 --> 01:15:18,894
Abe!

964
01:15:19,353 --> 01:15:20,979
Die! Die! Die!

965
01:15:21,063 --> 01:15:22,064
Max!

966
01:15:22,856 --> 01:15:24,650
Die! Die!

967
01:15:26,944 --> 01:15:29,279
Why won't you fucking die?!

968
01:15:33,325 --> 01:15:34,952
Oh, shit. What the fuck?

969
01:15:36,078 --> 01:15:38,121
-What is that?
-What the fuck is that?

970
01:15:38,205 --> 01:15:39,206
What is that?!

971
01:15:39,998 --> 01:15:41,458
-Nina!
-What the fuck?! No!

972
01:15:42,042 --> 01:15:43,502
-Nina!
-What is that?!

973
01:15:43,585 --> 01:15:45,462
Abe! What is that?!

974
01:15:45,546 --> 01:15:46,588
Holy shit!

975
01:16:36,513 --> 01:16:37,973
I'm gonna follow him

976
01:16:38,056 --> 01:16:40,809
and see if I can find out
anything that will help us.

977
01:16:41,435 --> 01:16:42,436
I have to try.

978
01:17:06,168 --> 01:17:07,544
-Fuck.
-Oh, my God. They're coming.

979
01:17:09,213 --> 01:17:10,589
Fuck. They're all coming.

980
01:17:12,132 --> 01:17:13,133
We need to run.

981
01:17:13,217 --> 01:17:15,302
All we've been doing
is running away.

982
01:17:15,385 --> 01:17:17,471
So let's start running
towards something.

983
01:17:17,554 --> 01:17:18,680
What do you mean?

984
01:17:24,978 --> 01:17:26,021
I'm going into that tunnel.

985
01:17:26,104 --> 01:17:28,315
Clover. We don't even know
what's over there.

986
01:17:28,398 --> 01:17:29,650
You realise this could
be our last night.

987
01:17:29,733 --> 01:17:30,734
Good.

988
01:17:32,277 --> 01:17:34,112
It means more
when you only have one shot.

989
01:17:35,531 --> 01:17:37,199
I'm sorry I got you into this.

990
01:17:38,492 --> 01:17:39,868
You're all here because of me.

991
01:17:41,662 --> 01:17:44,039
Melanie was my family,
but you're my family too.

992
01:17:44,122 --> 01:17:46,667
So I'm gonna save Megan,
kill Hill

993
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:48,544
and then get us
the fuck out of here.

994
01:17:50,879 --> 01:17:51,964
I'm done with death.

995
01:18:08,397 --> 01:18:09,439
Clover.

996
01:18:13,652 --> 01:18:14,820
We stick together.

997
01:18:25,873 --> 01:18:27,875
Oh, fuck.

998
01:18:29,751 --> 01:18:30,752
Come on.

999
01:18:31,837 --> 01:18:33,255
Oh, my God.

1000
01:18:51,565 --> 01:18:52,900
Holy shit.

1001
01:18:53,567 --> 01:18:54,860
This place is huge.

1002
01:19:13,587 --> 01:19:14,588
Hey, careful.

1003
01:19:28,393 --> 01:19:29,436
Watch your step.

1004
01:19:39,446 --> 01:19:40,489
Come on.

1005
01:20:31,832 --> 01:20:32,833
Is that...?

1006
01:20:39,756 --> 01:20:41,091
Don't move.

1007
01:21:02,571 --> 01:21:03,906
Go, go, go!

1008
01:21:03,989 --> 01:21:06,283
Go! Go, go, go!

1009
01:21:06,366 --> 01:21:08,076
Go! Go, go, go!

1010
01:21:13,373 --> 01:21:15,834
-Nina! Nina! Go! Come on!
-Go, go, go!

1011
01:21:17,002 --> 01:21:18,212
Come on, guys!

1012
01:21:44,154 --> 01:21:46,240
Go, go, go! Go!

1013
01:21:47,032 --> 01:21:49,701
Guys, right here, right here!
Right here!

1014
01:21:50,577 --> 01:21:52,120
Go! Go, go!

1015
01:21:58,585 --> 01:22:00,045
Wait! Wait! Wait!

1016
01:22:02,256 --> 01:22:03,382
Oh, fuck.

1017
01:22:11,014 --> 01:22:13,725
-Max. Max, Max!
-Go! We'll find another way!

1018
01:22:13,809 --> 01:22:14,852
Max, no!

1019
01:22:15,394 --> 01:22:16,603
Go! Go find Megan!

1020
01:22:17,646 --> 01:22:19,606
Go! We'll make it out of here.

1021
01:22:21,066 --> 01:22:22,109
Hey, asshole!

1022
01:22:25,737 --> 01:22:27,072
Oh, fuck.

1023
01:23:49,613 --> 01:23:50,989
Please don't do this. Mel.

1024
01:23:55,202 --> 01:23:57,287
It's m-- It's me. It's me.

1025
01:24:24,898 --> 01:24:26,149
I love you, Mel.

1026
01:24:28,068 --> 01:24:30,445
But I'm getting the fuck out
of this hellhole.

1027
01:24:40,455 --> 01:24:41,540
Max!

1028
01:24:54,970 --> 01:24:55,971
Fuck.

1029
01:24:59,266 --> 01:25:01,560
Fuck you, asshole. Die!

1030
01:25:11,737 --> 01:25:12,988
Aw, fuck.

1031
01:27:29,875 --> 01:27:30,876
Help!

1032
01:27:30,959 --> 01:27:32,794
-Megan!
-Help!

1033
01:27:36,715 --> 01:27:38,133
-Megan!
-Clover!

1034
01:27:38,217 --> 01:27:39,218
Watch out!

1035
01:27:50,562 --> 01:27:52,397
Megan, I'm gonna find a way

1036
01:27:52,481 --> 01:27:53,607
out of here.
I'm gonna get a key, okay?

1037
01:27:53,690 --> 01:27:54,691
Hurry!

1038
01:28:35,065 --> 01:28:40,237
You have been
an intriguing patient, Clover.

1039
01:28:44,241 --> 01:28:46,994
Far more interesting
than the rest.

1040
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:50,038
Severe depression,

1041
01:28:51,081 --> 01:28:54,084
two failed suicide attempts,

1042
01:28:54,168 --> 01:28:56,503
extreme anxiety...

1043
01:28:57,296 --> 01:28:59,339
You've lost control, Clover.

1044
01:28:59,423 --> 01:29:03,051
And that's evident by every
monster you've encountered here.

1045
01:29:03,969 --> 01:29:06,180
You see, they each represent

1046
01:29:06,263 --> 01:29:09,391
a unique manifestation
of your psyche.

1047
01:29:11,476 --> 01:29:12,811
What are you talking about?

1048
01:29:12,895 --> 01:29:16,231
Being chased
by a masked psycho is common.

1049
01:29:16,315 --> 01:29:18,817
Everyone feels powerless
in some way.

1050
01:29:20,027 --> 01:29:25,073
And the witch is, of course,
a personification of repression.

1051
01:29:25,157 --> 01:29:28,911
Now, the spontaneous combustion...

1052
01:29:28,994 --> 01:29:31,705
Very rare, Clover.

1053
01:29:32,956 --> 01:29:34,541
I think it's a nod

1054
01:29:34,625 --> 01:29:38,545
to your more
self-destructive tendencies.

1055
01:29:38,629 --> 01:29:39,630
Fuck you.

1056
01:29:41,048 --> 01:29:42,799
I am getting my friends
out of here.

1057
01:29:42,883 --> 01:29:45,928
Well, you're the only one
who can, Clover.

1058
01:29:47,012 --> 01:29:48,388
This place...

1059
01:29:49,806 --> 01:29:54,353
is drawing on your insecurities
and your fears.

1060
01:29:55,687 --> 01:29:58,982
I'm sorry, are you telling me
that this was all in my head?

1061
01:29:59,066 --> 01:30:00,484
Is none of this real?

1062
01:30:00,567 --> 01:30:01,944
Of course it's real.

1063
01:30:02,486 --> 01:30:06,406
But you are the engine
that makes it run,

1064
01:30:06,490 --> 01:30:08,992
just like Melanie
and all the others

1065
01:30:09,076 --> 01:30:12,412
made it run, run, run, run.

1066
01:30:20,003 --> 01:30:21,964
Help! Help!

1067
01:30:22,047 --> 01:30:23,215
You hear that, Clover?

1068
01:30:23,298 --> 01:30:26,343
Your friends
are all about to die again.

1069
01:30:26,426 --> 01:30:28,929
Tick, tick, tick...

1070
01:30:29,513 --> 01:30:31,139
Why? Why are you doing this?

1071
01:30:32,224 --> 01:30:33,267
Why?

1072
01:30:34,351 --> 01:30:37,187
Because this is what I study.

1073
01:30:37,771 --> 01:30:40,357
Fear is my trade.

1074
01:30:40,858 --> 01:30:45,571
People with trauma,
like yourself, Clover...

1075
01:30:45,654 --> 01:30:50,325
And places with trauma,
like Glore Valley...

1076
01:30:51,285 --> 01:30:53,579
When I put
the two of them together...

1077
01:30:55,789 --> 01:30:58,250
trauma becomes terror...

1078
01:30:59,168 --> 01:31:00,419
and sparks...

1079
01:31:00,961 --> 01:31:02,171
ignite.

1080
01:31:05,424 --> 01:31:07,384
Help!
Shit, guys, I'm fucking stuck!

1081
01:31:10,637 --> 01:31:11,680
And it creates...

1082
01:31:12,556 --> 01:31:13,849
the perfect...

1083
01:31:15,058 --> 01:31:16,143
horror.

1084
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:35,662
Fuck, they're coming!
Please help! Please!

1085
01:31:40,292 --> 01:31:42,252
But to make this

1086
01:31:42,753 --> 01:31:44,546
truly effective

1087
01:31:44,630 --> 01:31:46,798
like I've said before,

1088
01:31:47,424 --> 01:31:50,260
someone always has to die.

1089
01:31:50,344 --> 01:31:52,179
They're fucking coming! Hurry!

1090
01:32:01,605 --> 01:32:02,606
Yeah.

1091
01:32:03,106 --> 01:32:04,483
But this time...

1092
01:32:04,566 --> 01:32:05,567
it's you.

1093
01:32:37,099 --> 01:32:38,183
Clover!

1094
01:32:39,017 --> 01:32:40,310
Hurry!

1095
01:32:50,195 --> 01:32:51,488
Go.

1096
01:32:52,155 --> 01:32:53,365
Go, go, go.

1097
01:33:17,931 --> 01:33:19,099
The ladder.

1098
01:33:20,475 --> 01:33:21,476
Come on!

1099
01:33:32,070 --> 01:33:33,280
There's a way up!

1100
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:37,951
Come on, get up.

1101
01:34:06,104 --> 01:34:07,314
Clover!

1102
01:34:07,397 --> 01:34:08,982
No! No!

1103
01:34:21,870 --> 01:34:24,540
-Clover!
-We got you, we got you.

1104
01:34:27,042 --> 01:34:28,752
Megan!

1105
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:49,481
What's happening?

1106
01:34:52,234 --> 01:34:55,153
Look. Look. The sky.

1107
01:35:14,715 --> 01:35:15,966
We did it.

1108
01:35:16,842 --> 01:35:18,218
It's over.

1109
01:35:24,349 --> 01:35:25,350
Jesus!

1110
01:35:25,434 --> 01:35:27,352
You guys planning on staying
another night, or what?
