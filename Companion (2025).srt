1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000

3
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:47,339
<i>Most of the time, it's like--</i>

4
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:48,424
<i>I don't know.</i>

5
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:50,509
<i>It's like there's</i>
<i>this thick, black cloud</i>

6
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:51,761
<i>covering everything.</i>

7
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,389
<i>Like we see the world,</i>

8
00:00:55,473 --> 00:00:58,142
<i>but we don't really</i>
<i>see the world, you know?</i>

9
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:01,937
<i>We're all</i>
<i>just stumbling around.</i>

10
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,356
<i>Directionless.</i>
<i>No sense of meaning.</i>

11
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,691
<i>No sense of purpose.</i>

12
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,362
<i>I know that might</i>
<i>sound super depressing,</i>

13
00:01:10,446 --> 00:01:13,407
<i>but honestly,</i>
<i>I think it's a good thing.</i>

14
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:18,037
<i>Because it makes us appreciate</i>
<i>the other times.</i>

15
00:01:20,456 --> 00:01:22,291
<i>Those brief,</i>
<i>transcendent moments</i>

16
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:25,085
<i>when the lights flicker on,</i>
<i>the black cloud parts,</i>

17
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:27,004
<i>and you see the world</i>
<i>for what it really is.</i>

18
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,131
Oh.

19
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:34,637
<i>And suddenly there's meaning.</i>

20
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,181
<i>Suddenly there's purpose.</i>

21
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,148
So, uh, do you--

22
00:01:46,232 --> 00:01:49,193
Oh, shit.
Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

23
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:52,655
Shit.

24
00:01:58,702 --> 00:01:59,703
<i>If you're lucky,</i>

25
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:01,789
<i>you'll experience this</i>
<i>once in your lifetime.</i>

26
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:03,666
Goddamn, that was…

27
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:05,626
- That was smooth.
- Yeah.

28
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:06,710
<i>For me…</i>

29
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:07,837
So smooth.

30
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,088
<i>…it happened twice.</i>

31
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,550
<i>The first</i>
<i>was the day I met Josh.</i>

32
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:13,926
Uh, I'm Josh.

33
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,011
I'm Iris.

34
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:18,472
<i>And the second…</i>

35
00:02:20,558 --> 00:02:21,976
<i>the day I killed him.</i>

36
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:35,614
<i>Iris, wake up.</i>

37
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:42,580
Hey, sleepyhead.

38
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:45,499
How long was I out?

39
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:48,252
Uh, for a while.

40
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:51,005
Yeah, you were
zonked out there pretty good.

41
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:54,425
I was having
the most wonderful dream.

42
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,176
Oh, yeah? About me?

43
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:59,513
Well, that is
very presumptuous, but…

44
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:00,431
Yeah.

45
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:03,601
- …yes.
- Yes. Knew it.

46
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:04,768
Was it sexy times?

47
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:06,270
No, you deviant.

48
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,855
- Little bit of sexy times?
- No, I was--

49
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:08,939
- Was my shirt off?
- No,

50
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:11,191
I was dreaming
about the day we met.

51
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,652
It was all so perfect.

52
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,238
Remember
how perfect it all was?

53
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:18,657
Yeah, no.
No, how could I forget?

54
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,494
The supermarket, the oranges.

55
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,126
What road is this?

56
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,836
It's not showing up
on the GPS.

57
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,922
I don't think this is
the road.

58
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:34,840
Think this might be
the driveway.

59
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:06,914
<i>You have arrived</i>

60
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,540
<i>at your destination.</i>

61
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:10,042
Thank you, Josh's car.

62
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:13,629
Thank you, car.

63
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:15,464
Pop the trunk.

64
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:16,507
<i>Popping trunk.</i>

65
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:19,593
Fuck me.

66
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,221
Kat called this place

67
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,139
a "little rustic cabin
in the woods."

68
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:25,557
I think we might have
differing opinions

69
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:27,893
on the meaning
of the word "cabin."

70
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,479
Also "rustic."

71
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:32,773
Also "little."

72
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:40,447
What?

73
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:45,160
Iris. Come on.
You know you can't lie to me.

74
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:46,286
Tell me what's wrong.

75
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,746
I'm gonna do something stupid.

76
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,206
I'm gonna say
something stupid.

77
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,208
I'm gonna embarrass you.
They're gonna laugh at me.

78
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,377
They're gonna hate me.
They already hate me.

79
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,461
Jesus Christ, Iris.

80
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:56,005
We've been planning this trip
for months,

81
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:57,965
and this is all
just coming out now?

82
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,508
Like 20 feet
from the fucking door?

83
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:03,220
Look, look. Hey.

84
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,098
My friends don't hate you.

85
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:07,182
Kat does.

86
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:09,685
Yeah, m-maybe,
but Kat hates everybody.

87
00:05:10,436 --> 00:05:12,855
I just don't wanna
screw everything up.

88
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,733
Come on, Beep-Boop. You're
not gonna screw everything up.

89
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,652
Just relax, you know?

90
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:20,904
Don't be all mopey and weird.

91
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,489
Just remember to--

92
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,867
remember to smile
and act happy.

93
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:26,410
Okay?

94
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:33,709
Yay! You made it.
Fucking finally.

95
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,503
Okay, so when you said remote,
I thought you meant, like,

96
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:38,172
a couple miles
off the highway.

97
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,758
I didn't realize you meant
edge of fucking civilization.

98
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,176
Oh, don't be
so dramatic, Josh.

99
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,219
- It's not that far.
- Okay, hard disagree.

100
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:50,350
Uh, hello, Iris.

101
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:52,394
Hi, Kat.
It's so good to see you.

102
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,354
So good.

103
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,860
Everyone, look who I found.

104
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,361
- Hey, Patrick.
- Hey.

105
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:02,946
Look at you
in the kitchen, man.

106
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,074
Yeah, look at me. Welcome.
I would give you a hug,

107
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:07,367
but I've got scallop hands.
Sorry.

108
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:09,745
Okay, well, I appreciate that.
Where's--

109
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:12,164
- There he is!
- Hey!

110
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:15,584
Joshyboy, Joshyboy.

111
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:16,668
Hey, buddy.

112
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:17,961
You too, girl. Get in here.

113
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:20,214
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi! How are you?

114
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,800
I'm good. Uh, I'm… drunk.

115
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,177
- Oh.
- Good. This is good.

116
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:28,180
Oh, and, Josh,
you remember Sergey.

117
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,264
Hey.

118
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:36,146
Hey, Sergey.
Nice to see you again.

119
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,940
- Likewise, my friend.
- Oh.

120
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,525
Likewise.

121
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:43,529
And this beautiful creation
must be Iris.

122
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:45,280
- Hello.
- Mmm.

123
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:46,198
Such pleasure.

124
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,908
I have heard lot
about this one.

125
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:51,078
Really? All good I hope.

126
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:59,461
Your lake house, it's really--
it's incredible.

127
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:01,004
- Yeah, and so secluded.
- Yeah.

128
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,173
I mean, I think
the last place we passed

129
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:04,842
was like ten miles back.

130
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,427
Seventeen.
And I paid for this.

131
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:09,555
Privacy does not come cheap,
my friends.

132
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:11,348
Not cheap at all.

133
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,933
Don't tell me
you own the whole lake.

134
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:16,812
No, no, no. Don't be silly.
Just all the land around it.

135
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,189
But let's
get you guys a drink.

136
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,150
What do you like?
Beer, cocktail, wine?

137
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:24,194
I'm fine. More than anything,
I just need a shower.

138
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:25,988
<i>Katyonak</i>,
what room they are in?

139
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,031
Uh, up the stairs,
down the hall,

140
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,533
- last door on the left.
- Okay.

141
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,952
- I'll see you later. Yeah.
- Okay, I'll see you. Bye.

142
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:39,561
Smile.

143
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:44,650
Act happy.

144
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:48,737
<i>Okay, continue.</i>
<i>Continue with the story.</i>

145
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,323
Anyway, so I was

146
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:54,868
wearing this ridiculously
elaborate Dracula costume,

147
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:58,330
and I didn't know
a single person, as I said.

148
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:00,582
So I'm standing
by the snack table

149
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:04,336
just munching on carrots
and something

150
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,588
- that looked like hummus--
- It wasn't hummus.

151
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:07,673
It was not hummus.

152
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:10,175
It was not hummus,
I don't think, but I--

153
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,761
I feel a tap on my shoulder.

154
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:14,972
And so I turn around,

155
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:21,144
and there's this green,
puffy dinosaur

156
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:22,437
just staring me down.

157
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,023
And inside its head,

158
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:28,819
I hear this very muffled,
very annoyed voice say…

159
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:32,030
"You're standing on my tail."

160
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:35,450
So I turn around, I look down,
and sure enough,

161
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:38,829
I'm standing
on his little dino tail.

162
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,790
So I step off and apologize.

163
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:44,459
And he takes his head off,

164
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:47,504
and I'm looking
at the most beautiful man

165
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,256
that I've ever seen
in my life.

166
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:52,592
So, did you meet
this beautiful man

167
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:55,429
- after you met Eli, or…
- Okay, you know what? Shut up.

168
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,472
- Was that a scallop?
- That was a scallop.

169
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:59,975
- Actually hit me.
- Yeah, I took baseball.

170
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:00,892
Yes, you did.

171
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:02,144
Well, when did you know?

172
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:05,480
Uh, know what?

173
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:06,565
That--

174
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,900
That he was the one.

175
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:10,152
Oh.

176
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:12,154
Right then and there.

177
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,990
I know it's gonna
sound cheesy, but the moment--

178
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,952
the moment we locked eyes,
something inside of me just…

179
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,496
clicked into place.

180
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,415
Doesn't sound cheesy at all.

181
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:24,916
I get it.

182
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:30,297
It's like there's this piece
of you

183
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,257
that you didn't
even know was broken,

184
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:33,342
and then…

185
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,721
suddenly it's-- it's fixed.

186
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,851
<i>And you're-- you're staring</i>
<i>at this stranger,</i>

187
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:45,854
<i>this person</i>
<i>you've never met before,</i>

188
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:48,273
<i>and you know…</i>

189
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,651
that for the rest
of your life,

190
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:57,449
you will do whatever it takes
to make this person happy.

191
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:03,830
Right?

192
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:05,624
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

193
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,125
Yeah, totally.

194
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,965
Patrick, this food
is unbelievable. Thank you.

195
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:15,884
Thank you, Sergey.
That's so nice of you.

196
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,094
Um, I'm glad you like it.

197
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,678
He spoils me.
I swear I've gained

198
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:20,847
like ten pounds
since we started dating.

199
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:24,226
- Only ten?
- Shut the fuck up. Okay?

200
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:28,271
So, Sergey,
what kind of work do you do?

201
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:34,069
Oh, you know,
I have fingers in many pots.

202
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:39,449
My hands are not clean,
my friend.

203
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,743
It's a…

204
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:46,164
…a very dirty business.

205
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,708
<i>Sergey seems--</i>

206
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,794
He seems nice.

207
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:51,878
Oh, yeah.

208
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:55,048
He's got everything
you want in a man.

209
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,885
Yeah, he's rich, intelligent.

210
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:00,971
He's got a beautiful wife.

211
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:04,641
Wife? So, he--
Sergey's married?

212
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:05,892
Mm-hmm.

213
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:08,437
But you love--
you love each other?

214
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,273
Love? No. No, no, no.

215
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:15,193
He'd have to think of me as a
human being first.

216
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:16,945
I don't understand.

217
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,532
I'm an accessory,
like his fucking car.

218
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:26,371
I wear what he wants.
Eat what he wants.

219
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:28,457
Fuck when he wants.

220
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,172
Look who I'm talking to.

221
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,346
Do you not like me, Kat?

222
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:49,561
You know, it's not that
I don't like you, Iris.

223
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,272
It's the idea of you.

224
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,441
You make me feel so…

225
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:57,694
replaceable.

226
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:00,322
Replaceable?

227
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:04,367
Nobody could replace you, Kat.

228
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,994
I mean, you're Kat.

229
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:08,413
And you're so fearless.
It's inspiring.

230
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:10,248
I wish I could be
more like you, but…

231
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,419
…you know,
I wasn't built that way.

232
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:16,755
I just…

233
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,633
I feel like there's always
something inside of me

234
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:20,717
holding me back.

235
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,411
No, no, no.

236
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,496
♪ <i>Uh-huh</i> ♪

237
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:51,498
Come on.

238
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:57,212
♪ <i>Uh-huh</i> ♪

239
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,466
Okay, get up, bitch.

240
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,468
- Get up! Come on!
- No. Oh, God.

241
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:05,345
- Come on!
- That's right.

242
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,222
- You too.
- What the fuck?

243
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:08,598
Put that phone away
and get up.

244
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,267
- Okay.
- Get your asses up.

245
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,185
- Come on.
- Come on!

246
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,359
Iris, what are you doing?

247
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:28,178
Ah!

248
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,027
I'm so glad we did this.

249
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:47,739
Being here with you
is just perfect.

250
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:49,991
Uh-huh.

251
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:55,538
I'm sorry if I was being weird
or mopey earlier.

252
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:03,380
I just want you
to be happy, Josh. That's all.

253
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,048
Iris, go to sleep.

254
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,566
It's such a gorgeous day out.

255
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:25,902
Uh, what's the weather?

256
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,029
It's currently 72 degrees

257
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:30,782
with an 83% chance
of rain in the evening.

258
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,367
It never gets old.

259
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:41,334
- You almost ready?
- Oh, I'm sorry, babe.

260
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:42,877
I think I need
some time to shower

261
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:44,546
and pound
a few gallons of coffee.

262
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:45,880
Why don't, uh--

263
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:48,007
Why don't you head
down there by yourself?

264
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:49,592
But it was your idea.

265
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,263
You said you wanted a nice,
relaxing morning by the lake.

266
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:56,099
I know, but that's before the
hangover caught up with me.

267
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,435
Last night was a lot.

268
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:00,979
You had fun though, right?

269
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:03,940
Of course I did, Beep-Boop.

270
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,276
Last night was incredible.

271
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:21,416
You want me to wait?

272
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,794
We could
make the shower for two.

273
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:29,382
Nah, no, no.
That's okay. Um…

274
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:31,509
You go on ahead.

275
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,596
Enjoy as much of this
gorgeous day as you can.

276
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,349
- Okay.
- Yeah.

277
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:39,559
Hmm.

278
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,410
Sorry?

279
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:21,911
Means "good morning."

280
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:24,247
Oh, yes.

281
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,749
<i>Dobroe utro</i> to you too.

282
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,711
Hey, your Russian is not bad.

283
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:33,381
It is not good,
but also it is not bad.

284
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:37,343
Nice view.

285
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:45,935
To love.

286
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:55,695
Mmm.

287
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:56,779
You like?

288
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:59,282
I think I'm actually going to
head back inside.

289
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:01,492
So soon?

290
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:02,952
Yeah…

291
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,662
Josh wasn't feeling great
this morning,

292
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:06,122
so I think I should
check in on him.

293
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,958
Josh is big boy.
He can take care of himself.

294
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,960
Stay. Keep Sergey company.

295
00:20:12,587 --> 00:20:14,464
I really think I should
see him.

296
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:17,634
You…

297
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:20,553
like lake house, yes?

298
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:23,389
Yeah.

299
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:26,017
You enjoy your time here?

300
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,227
Mm-hmm. Yeah, very much.

301
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:32,065
Then as guest, please stay.

302
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:34,484
Keep this old Russian man
company.

303
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:39,697
- Okay.
- Wonderful.

304
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:40,782
Mmm.

305
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,919
Oh.

306
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:55,380
You mind?

307
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,466
Just back and shoulders.

308
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,385
- It's tough to reach.
- Oh.

309
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:02,428
Don't want to get too tan.

310
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:13,606
Okay.

311
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:17,568
Mmm.

312
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:23,116
And shoulders, please.

313
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,367
Okay.

314
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:40,383
What are you doing?

315
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:45,388
It's not problem.
This Kat's idea.

316
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,890
She tell Sergey
you are down here.

317
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:49,851
Give Sergey permission.

318
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,146
Let go of my hand, please.

319
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:56,024
This is what you do, yes?

320
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:58,735
This is what you are for.

321
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:03,197
- Mmm.
- Please.

322
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:05,074
Please stop.

323
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,078
I was drunk.
I mean, you--

324
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:10,121
Last night,
it was crazy.

325
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:11,164
You were extremely drunk.

326
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,166
You were drunk too.
Like, more drunk than I got.

327
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:14,876
I don't really get drunk.
It's like this gift.

328
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,794
Like, people get bloated
and stuff, and not me.

329
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:18,921
- Like, never happens.
- Never get bloated.

330
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,965
Never. It's like I could drink
and do whatever I want.

331
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:23,176
- It's like you get dehydrated.
- Yeah, just, like--

332
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:24,510
What the fuck?

333
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:26,679
Oh, shit.

334
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:29,557
Iris, what the fuck?

335
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:32,935
I didn't mean to. He--

336
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:36,147
He forced himself on me.

337
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:37,690
Who did?

338
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:39,942
Sergey?

339
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,361
Mmm.

340
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:43,613
Please.

341
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,365
Sergey just want little taste.

342
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:51,954
I just wanted him to stop.

343
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:55,917
Oh, God. Sergey.

344
00:22:58,961 --> 00:22:59,962
Iris.

345
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:02,590
Iris. Hey, look at me. Look
at me. Talk me through it.

346
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:03,758
What happened?

347
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:06,302
I--

348
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:11,557
I said stop!

349
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,313
I didn't have a choice.

350
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:26,697
Sergey?

351
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:45,133
He wouldn't let go.
He was choking me, Josh.

352
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,263
And then I--

353
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:51,848
And then you what, Iris?
Then you what?

354
00:23:57,145 --> 00:23:58,187
<i>He was trying to kill me,</i>

355
00:23:58,271 --> 00:23:59,397
<i>and the only thing</i>
<i>I could think about</i>

356
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,565
was that if he did kill me,

357
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:02,150
I'd never get to
see you again,

358
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:04,861
and that hurt so much more
than the pain of being choked!

359
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,404
I wouldn't let that happen.

360
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:07,780
I couldn't let him take me
away from you.

361
00:24:07,864 --> 00:24:09,782
I love you so much!

362
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:11,159
Iris, go to sleep.

363
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,380
Okay.
Don't forget her ankles, okay?

364
00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:26,048
Okay.

365
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:27,550
Are you sure
this is gonna hold?

366
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:29,093
Yeah, no, it's fine.

367
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:30,553
She's not superhuman
or anything.

368
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,763
She's only as strong
as they want her to be.

369
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:56,746
Handcuff knot.

370
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,500
- Hey.
- Hey.

371
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:02,835
How's she doing?

372
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:05,254
She's asleep.
I gave her two Xanax.

373
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:07,548
Xanaxes? Xani?

374
00:25:07,632 --> 00:25:09,926
- Whatever, she's asleep.
- Okay, good. Good.

375
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:11,469
So…

376
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:13,971
what do we do now?

377
00:25:14,055 --> 00:25:15,848
Uh, I mean,
the only thing we can do.

378
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:18,226
We call the cops.
We tell them everything.

379
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:19,435
Right, yeah.

380
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,520
- Yeah.
- But what about…

381
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:26,567
Well, uh, obviously
I'll need to, uh, you know.

382
00:25:27,777 --> 00:25:29,487
I just don't understand
how this could have happened.

383
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,155
Don't they have safeguards
for this kind of shit?

384
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:32,490
I have no idea.

385
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,867
Like a glitch maybe?

386
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:36,702
Yeah.

387
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:41,874
Okay. Okay, so…

388
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:45,169
I'll call the cops,
and you will…

389
00:25:45,253 --> 00:25:47,129
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah.

390
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:50,091
Sorry, do you mind,
um, taking it outside?

391
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:53,678
Just 'cause…
I-- I wanna say goodbye.

392
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:56,931
Yeah.

393
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:58,641
- Yeah, buddy. Sure.
- Yeah, thanks.

394
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:09,902
Iris, wake up.

395
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:10,987
…be lost without you!

396
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,614
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, it's okay. You're okay.

397
00:26:13,698 --> 00:26:15,741
- You're okay. I'm here. Hey.
- Josh.

398
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:17,326
Listen to me.

399
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:20,705
Wait. Why are my hands tied?
Why are my hands tied, Josh?

400
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:23,082
Iris. We didn't have a choice.
We didn't have a choice.

401
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:24,875
You murdered Sergey.
You remember?

402
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:25,793
No, no, no, no.

403
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:27,545
It was self-defense.
He was gonna kill me.

404
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:29,588
He was gonna kill me.
You gotta believe me.

405
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:31,173
No, I believe you, Iris.

406
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:33,009
I mean, you couldn't lie to me
even if you wanted to.

407
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:34,719
What?

408
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:38,180
It's, um,
part of your programming.

409
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:41,559
Programming? What the hell
are you talking about?

410
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:44,562
Okay, um…

411
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:46,981
Sorry, there's just
no delicate way to say this.

412
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:51,068
So, I'm just gonna
rip the Band-Aid right off.

413
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,405
You're a robot.

414
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:58,617
I'm…

415
00:26:58,701 --> 00:26:59,994
A robot.

416
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:06,208
More specifically,
you're a companion robot.

417
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,087
A companion robot?

418
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:12,006
Yeah, it's like a, um…

419
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:15,718
I hate the word "fuckbot."

420
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:18,512
Um, 'cause you do so much more
than that, but, uh…

421
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:22,350
You're an
emotional support robot…

422
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:24,852
that fucks.

423
00:27:26,604 --> 00:27:27,688
You're joking, right?

424
00:27:27,772 --> 00:27:29,690
- This is just a sick--
- Iris, what's the weather?

425
00:27:29,774 --> 00:27:30,775
It's currently 72 degrees

426
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:33,194
with an 83% chance
of rain in the evening.

427
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:38,282
- Are--
- Hmm.

428
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:40,117
Are you still not convinced?

429
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:41,827
Yeah, okay, uh…

430
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:44,121
Let's see.

431
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:45,956
Iris, do you know
any foreign languages?

432
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,459
Can you speak, say, Spanish?

433
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:50,961
Josh, you know
<i>no sé hablar español</i>.

434
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:53,506
<i>¿Qué?</i>

435
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:55,341
How about Chinese?

436
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:58,677
Do I need to keep going?

437
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:00,179
'Cause I can go, uh…

438
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:02,515
I can do Portuguese.
I can do Korean.

439
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:03,766
I can do, uh…

440
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,353
I don't know what Telugu is,
but apparently you speak it.

441
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:09,230
I don't-- I don't understand.

442
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:10,940
I--

443
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:12,400
No, no, no. I have memories.

444
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:15,945
Uh, uh… College.
Uh, summer jobs. I've--

445
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:18,406
I've been to Japan. Twice.

446
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:19,782
Okay, so what those are--

447
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:20,866
Those are, um…

448
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,285
They're like outlines
of memories.

449
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:26,872
You know, just enough to give
you a little, uh, backstory.

450
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:29,083
The-- The-- The day we met
in the grocery store.

451
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:32,753
You and the oranges. That is
not an outline of a memory.

452
00:28:32,837 --> 00:28:34,630
Yeah, it's fake.
Never happened.

453
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:35,714
I just randomly picked it

454
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:37,133
from a drop-down list
of meet-cutes.

455
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:39,844
It could've been anywhere.
It could've been dog park,

456
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:43,013
a bookstore, farmer's market.

457
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:46,392
It never happened?

458
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:49,061
Okay, do, um--

459
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:51,981
Do you wanna know how we met?
Like, how we really met?

460
00:28:57,528 --> 00:28:59,321
Hey. Josh Beeman?

461
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:01,657
- Yeah, that's me.
- Okay.

462
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,159
- Yeah, come on in.
- Thank you.

463
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:11,167
Sorry.

464
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:13,794
How you doing?

465
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:19,967
Okay, this is
the user agreement.

466
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,093
- Okay.
- Just give it a read

467
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:23,137
and then sign at the bottom
when you're done.

468
00:29:23,888 --> 00:29:24,889
Um…

469
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:32,980
So, um, what do I do

470
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:36,317
when she, like,
boots up or whatever?

471
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:38,694
Well, once she's done
syncing with your phone,

472
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,446
you'll need to
create a love link.

473
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,948
- Love link?
- Yeah. It establishes

474
00:29:43,032 --> 00:29:45,242
the emotional connection
between you and…

475
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,913
Iris.

476
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:51,040
Just follow the vocal prompts
when she wakes up.

477
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,458
It's all pretty intuitive.

478
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:58,297
Do they-- Do they know
that they're robots?

479
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,381
Not at all.

480
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:02,426
She'll be so fixated on you,
your wants, your needs,

481
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,802
that'll never even occur
to her.

482
00:30:03,886 --> 00:30:05,596
The whole experience
is customizable.

483
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,973
You can change her voice,
eye color, intelligence,

484
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:10,809
and if you ever wanna revert
back to her factory settings,

485
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:13,229
there is a thumbprint sensor
behind her right ear.

486
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:15,356
Just hold your thumb there
for five seconds,

487
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:16,440
she'll reset.

488
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:19,235
You can-- You can
change their intelligence?

489
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:20,611
Yeah, but don't worry.

490
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:23,155
There's about a billion
government regulations

491
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:24,532
that force us to limit

492
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:26,242
how strong and smart
they can be.

493
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,369
A hundred-percent intelligence
would be the equivalent

494
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:29,495
of an Ivy League grad.

495
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:32,706
Zero percent would be
a mindless automaton.

496
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:35,417
It really just depends on
what kind of partner you want.

497
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:38,170
She can't lie.
So if you ask her a question,

498
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:40,130
she literally has to
tell you the truth.

499
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:42,174
And for obvious reasons,
her programming prevents her

500
00:30:42,258 --> 00:30:44,176
from causing harm
to humans, animals,

501
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,303
or other companions.
Trust me, Mr. Beeman.

502
00:30:46,387 --> 00:30:47,930
You have nothing
to worry about.

503
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:50,224
Iris is completely docile.

504
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:52,977
She's yours to do
whatever you want with.

505
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:24,341
To establish love link,
please place your face

506
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:27,094
within three feet
of my field of vision.

507
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:45,070
Please say your name.

508
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:50,242
Josh Beeman.

509
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:55,331
Thank you, Josh Beeman.

510
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:17,770
Love link established.

511
00:32:29,323 --> 00:32:30,407
Hey, you.

512
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:33,619
H-Hi.

513
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:38,040
Um…

514
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:41,335
Uh…

515
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:43,796
So…

516
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,757
Oh, my God. Oh, fuck.

517
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,841
Oh, fuck!

518
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:50,552
Oh, God!

519
00:32:54,932 --> 00:32:56,350
I don't understand.

520
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,728
I feel things.

521
00:32:59,812 --> 00:33:03,774
Anger, guilt, sadness. I--

522
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:07,736
I know what pain feels like.

523
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,154
It's programming.

524
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:11,865
It's just a way
to make you seem more real.

525
00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:14,451
Everything you do,
your whole life,

526
00:33:14,535 --> 00:33:16,328
it's just an imitation
of a life.

527
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:21,208
There-- There we go.
Perfect. Okay.

528
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:23,752
This is just water.

529
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:26,338
You know, it's from
a reservoir in your body.

530
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:27,631
It's like wiper fluid.

531
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:30,801
I get it topped off every time
I take you in to get serviced.

532
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:32,052
Oh, God. I'm gonna be sick.

533
00:33:32,136 --> 00:33:33,512
No, you're not!

534
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:36,223
Iris, it's programming.

535
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:38,434
Stop saying that!

536
00:33:40,728 --> 00:33:43,230
Yeah, you're right.
You're right. I'm sorry.

537
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,315
I know this must be
a lot to process.

538
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:58,954
Okay.

539
00:34:01,457 --> 00:34:02,541
Okay, what?

540
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:04,376
I'm not real.

541
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,464
But I'm still yours.

542
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:12,676
We can get through this.
We can go back home.

543
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:15,053
I'll do whatever you want.

544
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:19,016
I'll cook for you, wait
on you, make love to you.

545
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:22,728
I can make you happy, Josh.

546
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:25,689
I can make you
so, so, so, so happy.

547
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:29,359
No.

548
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:32,321
I'm sorry, Iris.
That can't happen.

549
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:34,239
Why not?

550
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:36,825
Uh, what are you doing?

551
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:40,120
- Nothing, okay?
- What the fuck

552
00:34:40,204 --> 00:34:41,121
are you waiting for?

553
00:34:41,205 --> 00:34:42,790
- Shut her down already.
- Shut me down?

554
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:45,626
- Fuck, Kat. Jesus Christ!
- What is she talking about?

555
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:47,544
- Shut me down? Josh!
- Nothing, nothing. Just--

556
00:34:47,628 --> 00:34:49,421
Will you excuse me
for a second, Iris?

557
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:50,506
Josh! Please!

558
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:52,132
- Dude.
- No, come on.

559
00:34:52,216 --> 00:34:53,383
Josh!

560
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,094
Josh.

561
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:04,812
<i>You can't do that, Kat.</i>

562
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:06,647
<i>You can't tell a robot</i>
<i>you're gonna shut it down.</i>

563
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:09,358
That's, like, not cool at all.

564
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:12,069
Well, okay,
I don't like surprises, Josh.

565
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:14,321
This was not part of the plan.

566
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:16,573
Look, I know, and I'm sorry,
but I mean,

567
00:35:16,657 --> 00:35:18,242
considering everything
she's done for us,

568
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:20,452
I figured she was
at least owed an explanation.

569
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:22,412
And--

570
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:24,540
Okay, look,
I wanted to say goodbye.

571
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:25,624
Are you kidding?

572
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:28,752
She's a piece of plastic
that you have sex with.

573
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:29,670
Ugh.

574
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:32,297
Saying goodbye to her
is like saying goodbye

575
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:34,007
to the sock you jerk off in.

576
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:35,634
Okay, she's not a sock.

577
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,305
<i>The plan hasn't changed, Kat.</i>

578
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:42,307
<i>I'm just adding</i>
<i>one tiny, extra step.</i>

579
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:44,726
<i>Just a final farewell.</i>
<i>And then I will switch</i>

580
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,186
<i>all of her settings</i>
<i>back to normal.</i>

581
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:49,064
And then, yeah, I'll
shut her down permanently.

582
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,774
- And then?
- And then nothing.

583
00:35:50,858 --> 00:35:52,276
Then we crack open a bottle
of champagne,

584
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:53,777
and we wait
for the cops to show up.

585
00:35:56,113 --> 00:35:57,489
<i>I mean, the hard part's over.</i>

586
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:00,284
<i>Which, by the way,</i>

587
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:01,994
like, holy fucking shit!
Right?

588
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:04,454
<i>I mean, you plan,</i>
<i>and you plan, you plan,</i>

589
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:06,039
<i>and you, like, know</i>
<i>it's gonna happen,</i>

590
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:07,708
<i>but then, like, it happens,</i>
<i>and you're like,</i>

591
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:09,418
<i>"Holy fucking shit!"</i>

592
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:12,004
I mean, we did it!

593
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:14,423
We did it.
We, like, fucking did it.

594
00:36:17,134 --> 00:36:19,052
All-- All right, all right.
That's-- That's good.

595
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:20,804
- That's enough.
- Okay, yeah, sorry. Right.

596
00:36:20,888 --> 00:36:23,015
Sorry.
I still just can't believe it.

597
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,642
Yeah, I know. It's so crazy.

598
00:36:25,726 --> 00:36:27,185
What the fuck
is going on with you?

599
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:28,687
Why are you not
as excited as I am?

600
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:31,315
No, I am. I'm excited.
It's, um…

601
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:34,401
It's just-- It's just
the Xanax Eli gave me.

602
00:36:34,902 --> 00:36:36,111
You actually took it?

603
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:39,197
It's a Xanax, Josh.
I'm not gonna not take it.

604
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:45,370
Hey, Beep-Boop.
Look, I'm so sorry about that.

605
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:47,706
Everything's gonna be okay.
We're--

606
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:51,293
What are you doing?

607
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,211
Oh, fuck. Iris, go to s--

608
00:36:57,007 --> 00:36:58,008
Help!

609
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:02,262
Baby, I'm so sorry.

610
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:12,397
He'll need an ice pack,

611
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:14,399
and if there's any swelling,
shortness of breath,

612
00:37:14,483 --> 00:37:16,443
wheezing, agitation
or drowsiness,

613
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:18,487
take him
to the emergency room, okay?

614
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:19,571
Um…

615
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:21,657
okay.

616
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,701
Yeah, she's tied up inside,
so she's not going anywhere.

617
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:27,412
Mm-hmm.

618
00:37:27,496 --> 00:37:29,081
Eli. Eli, Iris is--

619
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:31,041
Baby, I'm
on the phone. I can't hear.

620
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,844
What's that?
What am I looking at?

621
00:37:43,387 --> 00:37:44,221
A mod.

622
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:45,722
A mod?

623
00:37:45,806 --> 00:37:47,641
And what does it mod?

624
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:50,811
Iris.

625
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:53,772
Gives me access
to parts of her programming

626
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:56,108
that you're not
typically given access to.

627
00:37:57,234 --> 00:38:01,238
I'm sorry.
Did you jailbreak your sexbot?

628
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:03,073
What did you do to her?

629
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:05,617
I bumped up her aggression

630
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:08,036
and her self-defense
functions.

631
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,455
And I turned off
the programming

632
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:13,166
that prevents her
from doing harm.

633
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,336
But she escaped before I had
the chance to reset her.

634
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:19,214
So if Empathix finds her
before we do,

635
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,674
then they'll know
she was tampered with,

636
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:22,509
and then we're fucked.

637
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:24,344
Wait, so does that mean that--

638
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:27,222
Did you kill Sergey?

639
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,807
No. No, no, no.
Iris killed Sergey.

640
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,726
- Thank God.
- We just gave her

641
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,102
- a little push.
- Oh, my God.

642
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:33,520
- Wait, Eli. Eli, you--
- Oh, my God.

643
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:35,856
You have to understand, Eli.
Sergey was a bad dude.

644
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:37,774
He was mixed up in all kinds
of fucked-up shit,

645
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:40,819
like drugs and guns
and, like, human trafficking.

646
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,529
Not to mention
a terrible boyfriend.

647
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:44,072
- Yeah, just the worst!
- Why?

648
00:38:44,156 --> 00:38:45,657
I don't know! Who's to say
what makes people

649
00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:46,575
do bad things?

650
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,326
It could have something
to do with his upbringing.

651
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:49,911
No, dick. Why did you do it?

652
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:51,288
Oh.

653
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:52,539
Right. Sorry. Um…

654
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:56,293
Well…

655
00:39:04,718 --> 00:39:06,553
- You remember the code?
- Of course.

656
00:39:07,137 --> 00:39:10,474
Stalin's birthday.
It's his code for everything.

657
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:20,942
I see.

658
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:23,236
How-- How-- How much is that?

659
00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:26,239
Um, just over 12 million.

660
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:33,080
Oh, goddamn it.
That smells so fucking good.

661
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:37,292
Wait.

662
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:42,506
If this whole trip was a setup
to get Iris to kill Sergey,

663
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,592
why did you have Patrick and I
tag along?

664
00:39:46,802 --> 00:39:48,470
To corroborate our story.

665
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,515
I mean, we figured it'd be
an easier sell

666
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:53,100
with more witnesses.

667
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:55,602
Oh. So, we were just
a couple of stooges, huh?

668
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:56,686
- No.
- Nice.

669
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:59,689
Technically, yes,
but that was the old plan.

670
00:39:59,773 --> 00:40:00,941
New plan…

671
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:04,069
you get a cut.

672
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:05,862
Even three-way split.

673
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:09,491
You mean four-way split.

674
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,785
No. I mean three-way.

675
00:40:12,661 --> 00:40:14,538
But there's four of us.

676
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:16,206
You're-- You're kidding.

677
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:17,457
He's-- He's kidding.

678
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:19,668
You, me, Kat, Patrick.

679
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:20,877
- Eli…
- Josh…

680
00:40:20,961 --> 00:40:21,962
Patrick doesn't count.

681
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:23,338
- Are you fucking--
- Wow.

682
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,215
- Right in front of him? Nice.
- I--

683
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:27,175
I'm so sorry, baby. I'm sorry
you had to hear that.

684
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:28,260
That's okay. I don't mind.

685
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:29,803
Patrick, go to sleep.

686
00:40:30,554 --> 00:40:31,680
What the fuck, dude?

687
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:33,223
You trying to
sabotage my relationship?

688
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:35,892
No! Of course not, man. I know
how much Patrick means to you.

689
00:40:35,976 --> 00:40:37,352
God knows you could have
traded him in

690
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,728
for a newer model,
like, many times.

691
00:40:38,812 --> 00:40:40,230
Are you fucking
robo-shaming me?

692
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:41,898
I am not robo-shaming you.

693
00:40:41,982 --> 00:40:44,192
I-- I like Patrick,
but he's not getting a cut.

694
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:45,694
You're lucky
you're getting anything

695
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,112
considering you contributed
jack shit.

696
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:48,822
What the fuck
did you contribute, huh?

697
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:49,906
Iris did everything.

698
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,241
I planted the knife
in her pocket.

699
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:53,285
- I had to practice that.
- The knife?

700
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:54,911
That was probably
the most flimsiest part

701
00:40:54,995 --> 00:40:56,288
of the plan, actually,
to be honest.

702
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:57,414
How did you know
she'd find it?

703
00:40:57,497 --> 00:40:58,331
I don't know.

704
00:40:58,415 --> 00:40:59,791
I've never orchestrated
a murder before.

705
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:00,834
It's fucking hard.

706
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:02,169
- Clearly.
- Okay!

707
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:05,672
- Eli.
- Yeah?

708
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:08,967
We're offering you
four million dollars.

709
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,886
And all you have to do
is help us

710
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:13,263
find one little robot girl
in the woods.

711
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:18,101
That's not a bad deal.

712
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,574
Fine.

713
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:36,203
But I call dibs on the gun.

714
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:39,539
<i>Eli.</i>

715
00:41:39,623 --> 00:41:41,124
We're not gonna need that.

716
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:42,542
I mean, all I have to do
is get close enough

717
00:41:42,626 --> 00:41:43,627
to put her to sleep

718
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,754
and grab my phone and wipe
the mod from her system.

719
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:47,047
<i>So we're fine.</i>

720
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,215
<i>She has your phone?</i>

721
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:50,717
<i>Yeah.</i>

722
00:41:53,637 --> 00:41:55,013
Does she know your passcode?

723
00:41:58,141 --> 00:42:01,394
Josh, does she know
your passcode?

724
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:04,981
<i>Yeah. I mean,</i>
<i>she knows everything about me.</i>

725
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:08,610
Yeah, then we're definitely
gonna need this.

726
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:13,698
Patrick, wake up.

727
00:42:13,782 --> 00:42:14,991
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

728
00:42:15,075 --> 00:42:16,701
We're going robot hunting.

729
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:17,827
Oh, okay.

730
00:42:17,911 --> 00:42:18,912
- Fun, huh?
- Fun.

731
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:21,331
Josh.

732
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:24,417
What can she do
with your phone?

733
00:42:55,448 --> 00:42:56,449
Hello.

734
00:42:58,285 --> 00:42:59,286
Hello.

735
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:02,914
Hello.

736
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:14,384
Wow, Josh.

737
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:48,585
Goddamn it, Josh. We've
been walking for-fucking-ever.

738
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:51,338
Isn't there like a "find
my fuckbot" app you can use?

739
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:53,506
Yeah, there is.
But guess what.

740
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:54,716
It's on my fucking phone.

741
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:56,926
- Goddamn it, Josh.
- Will you stop yelling?

742
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:58,636
We know the general direction
she was going.

743
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,846
We just need to--

744
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:01,181
Why don't we just split up?

745
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:03,892
That way, we can kind of
attack her from…

746
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:05,560
two different angles,
you know?

747
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:06,478
Like a pincer--

748
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:08,271
- Hit her-- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

749
00:44:08,355 --> 00:44:10,774
Eli and Patrick,
you guys go that way.

750
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:13,526
Kat and I,
we're gonna go this way. Okay?

751
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:14,986
Kat and you will go that way?

752
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:20,784
Are you guys fucking?

753
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:22,202
- Gross.
- No, of course not--

754
00:44:22,285 --> 00:44:23,119
"Gross"?

755
00:44:30,502 --> 00:44:32,045
Okay.

756
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,131
What now, Iris? Think.

757
00:44:35,215 --> 00:44:38,134
Use that
extra 60% intelligence.

758
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:40,804
Just need to get back home,

759
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:43,181
grab some clothes, money,
clean yourself up.

760
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:44,432
How do you do that?

761
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:51,773
You could work your way back
to the main road.

762
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:53,066
Hitch a ride.

763
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:57,612
What the fuck?

764
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:01,741
Okay, no hitchhiking.

765
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,704
You could go on foot.

766
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:09,374
It's hundreds of miles
across difficult terrain.

767
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:10,291
It could take days.

768
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:11,709
And by the time
you get back…

769
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:15,630
Welcome home, Beep-Boop.

770
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:19,634
Yeah, no walking.

771
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:24,514
You got Josh's phone.

772
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:27,934
The phone controls you.

773
00:45:29,978 --> 00:45:31,479
But it also controls…

774
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:38,361
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

775
00:45:38,445 --> 00:45:39,821
<i>Where would you like</i>
<i>to go today?</i>

776
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:40,989
Home, please.

777
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:42,157
<i>Driving home.</i>

778
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:46,286
<i>And might I add,</i>
<i>this is a terrific plan, Iris.</i>

779
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:47,370
Aw.

780
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,497
Thank you, Josh's car.

781
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:55,670
All you gotta do is
backtrack through the woods,

782
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,088
get to the lake house

783
00:45:57,172 --> 00:45:59,048
without Josh or his friends
murdering you,

784
00:45:59,132 --> 00:46:00,133
and you're home free.

785
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:07,140
Where'd you find it?

786
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:08,725
In his closet.

787
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:10,435
Like, who are you hunting,
Sergey?

788
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:11,603
It looks good on you.

789
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:12,520
Thanks, babe.

790
00:46:12,604 --> 00:46:15,023
You look good
in everything. You really do.

791
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:16,608
I swear, you can
pull everything off.

792
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:17,817
Like, any kind of vest--

793
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:20,236
What?

794
00:46:20,737 --> 00:46:22,071
You hear that?

795
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:24,491
No. What is it?

796
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:29,412
It's the sound of me realizing
how fucking stupid this is.

797
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:31,456
You don't think
we'll find her?

798
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:33,333
I don't know,
and, actually, I don't care.

799
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:35,376
Just let Josh and Kat
deal with her.

800
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,586
You're still upset

801
00:46:36,669 --> 00:46:37,629
they left you out
of their plan?

802
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:39,422
I'm just saying,
if the situation were reversed

803
00:46:39,506 --> 00:46:40,673
and I altered your programming

804
00:46:40,757 --> 00:46:42,717
to kill some dude so we could
steal millions from him,

805
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,968
I would've included Josh

806
00:46:44,052 --> 00:46:45,053
in the plan
right from the get-go.

807
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:46,679
I would've done that
because I'm a friend.

808
00:46:46,763 --> 00:46:47,597
That's what friends do, right?

809
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,182
They include each other,
right?

810
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:52,602
That's if you were a robot,
obviously.

811
00:46:53,228 --> 00:46:54,562
Yeah, obviously.

812
00:46:54,646 --> 00:46:58,024
Anyways, I am tired,
I am hungry

813
00:46:58,107 --> 00:47:00,777
and carrying this huge gun
makes me really horny.

814
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:03,363
So, how about we go back
to the cabin and we fuck?

815
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:04,864
And then you can make me
an omelet.

816
00:47:05,532 --> 00:47:06,533
Come on.

817
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:11,329
But you'd never do that
to me, right?

818
00:47:11,412 --> 00:47:12,413
Do what?

819
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:14,165
You wouldn't…

820
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:17,001
alter my programming?

821
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:20,004
What are you talking about,
babe?

822
00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:24,467
Eli, I know I'm a robot.

823
00:47:26,386 --> 00:47:27,637
How?

824
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,639
I've pieced it together
over the years.

825
00:47:30,306 --> 00:47:32,475
I don't understand.
You can't lie.

826
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:34,644
Yesterday,
you were telling the story

827
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:36,437
about how we met
as if it happened.

828
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:37,939
Because it's not a lie.

829
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:41,693
I mean, it may have
never happened, but…

830
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:44,112
my memory of it's real.

831
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:49,450
I close my eyes,
and I can see it.

832
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:51,995
Clear as day.

833
00:48:12,557 --> 00:48:15,184
Hey. Hey!

834
00:48:15,268 --> 00:48:16,853
You're standing on my tail.

835
00:48:17,729 --> 00:48:20,815
- What?
- You're standing on my tail!

836
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,233
- I'm sorry.
- What?

837
00:48:22,317 --> 00:48:23,526
I'm sorry.

838
00:48:26,738 --> 00:48:27,739
Hi.

839
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:30,450
Hi.

840
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:33,828
Uh, I'm Eli.

841
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:36,998
I'm Patrick.

842
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:53,139
Baby, you know I would
never hurt you, right?

843
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:54,307
You know
that I wouldn't treat you

844
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:55,808
the way that Josh
treats Iris, right?

845
00:48:55,892 --> 00:48:57,518
- I know that.
- I love you so much.

846
00:48:58,019 --> 00:48:58,895
And that's fucking insane

847
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:00,855
for me to say that
out loud, right?

848
00:49:03,024 --> 00:49:04,025
But I do.

849
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:06,277
Do you feel
how much I love you?

850
00:49:06,361 --> 00:49:07,445
I do.

851
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:10,740
What does it feel like?

852
00:49:12,909 --> 00:49:15,662
I don't know how to
describe something like that.

853
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:17,789
Can you try?

854
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:22,543
It feels like pain.

855
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:25,421
Like…

856
00:49:26,255 --> 00:49:28,508
the inside of my body
is on fire.

857
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:31,135
And it's angry.

858
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:33,429
And violent.

859
00:49:34,806 --> 00:49:36,140
And bright.

860
00:49:58,871 --> 00:50:00,873
Fuck you, Dad.
I'm in love with a robot.

861
00:50:00,957 --> 00:50:02,458
You're in love with a robot.

862
00:50:25,815 --> 00:50:26,816
Iris.

863
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:30,278
Iris?

864
00:50:30,903 --> 00:50:32,321
- Eli--
- Babe.

865
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,292
Ow!

866
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:46,252
Fuck, that's fucking loud!

867
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,045
Eli.

868
00:51:22,497 --> 00:51:24,165
Fuck.

869
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:41,015
This isn't personal, Iris.

870
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:43,392
You know I'm an ally, girl--

871
00:51:43,476 --> 00:51:47,230
But this is a lot
of fucking money--

872
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,284
Eli?

873
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:06,374
Patrick, I--

874
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:08,334
I'm sorry.

875
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:14,549
- Oh, my God.
- Iris! Go to sleep!

876
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:17,343
Fuck!

877
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:21,597
Iris!

878
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:26,561
Iris!

879
00:52:28,271 --> 00:52:29,438
Iris!

880
00:52:36,404 --> 00:52:37,405
Iris.

881
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:43,411
Fuck!

882
00:52:48,875 --> 00:52:50,626
Ow!

883
00:52:51,419 --> 00:52:52,920
Iris, open the door.

884
00:52:54,422 --> 00:52:55,923
Open the fucking door!

885
00:52:56,007 --> 00:52:57,758
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

886
00:52:57,842 --> 00:52:59,010
<i>Where would you like</i>
<i>to go today?</i>

887
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:00,094
Home. Drive home.

We could still go back home.

937
00:56:07,198 --> 00:56:08,949
Go back
to the way things were.

938
00:56:10,743 --> 00:56:13,996
What about Sergey and Eli?

939
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,956
<i>I'll just blame</i>

940

<i>So then</i>
<i>come back to me, Beep-Boop.</i>

948
00:56:44,235 --> 00:56:45,611
We can get through this.

949
00:56:46,362 --> 00:56:48,948
I can change.
I can be a better boyfriend.

950
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:52,993
I can finally treat you with
the respect that you deserve.

951
00:56:58,082 --> 00:56:59,500
I-- No. I can't.

952
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:01,043
<i>Why not?</i>

953
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:04,046
You programmed me
to murder someone, Josh.

954
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:07,216
It's really hard to come back
from something like that.

955
00:57:08,217 --> 00:57:12,263
- <i>Iris…</i>
- You're a great guy. You are.

956
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:15,099

<i>We're on two</i>
<i>totally different paths.</i>

958
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:19,687

959
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:22,148
What the fuck is happening?
Are you breaking up with me?

960
00:57:22,231 --> 00:57:23,315
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

961
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:26,527
<i>It's not you. It's me.</i>

962
00:57:27,194 --> 00:57:28,195
Iris--

963
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:30,781
Iris, don't you fucking--

964
00:57:45,379 --> 00:57:47,214
Patrick. Patrick, get up.

965
00:57:47,298 --> 00:57:49,216
I need you to track down Iris
for me, all right, buddy?

966
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,676
Before she gets too far away.

967
00:57:53,053 --> 00:57:54,680
We only have a small window
of time,

968
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:56,307
and it's only getting smaller,
all right?

969
00:57:57,057 --> 00:57:58,434
Josh, what are you doing?

970
00:57:58,517 --> 00:57:59,602
I'm taking care of it.

971
00:58:06,192 --> 00:58:08,235
Find Iris. Get my phone back.

972
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:10,946
My passcode is 561297.

973
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:12,615
Put her to sleep.
Bring her back to me.

974
00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:14,116
Don't let anyone
get in your way.

975
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,534
- Josh.
- I'm taking care of it!

976
00:58:19,747 --> 00:58:21,790
Okay. Okay.

977
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:29,006
Fuck it.

978
00:58:31,467 --> 00:58:32,635
Patrick, get up.

979
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:35,679
Patrick, get up!

980
00:58:40,142 --> 00:58:41,143

981
00:58:42,937 --> 00:58:45,940
Okay. Okay. Here we go.

00:58:51,195 --> 00:58:53,948

- Go.

984
00:58:54,657 --> 00:58:55,658
Resetting.

985
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:01,163

986
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:03,999
please place your face within
3 feet of my field of vision.

987
00:59:08,254 --> 00:59:09,380
Please say your name.

988
00:59:09,463 --> 00:59:10,464
Josh Beeman.

989
00:59:11,006 --> 00:59:12,424

990
00:59:15,261 --> 00:59:16,428
Thank you, Josh Beeman.

Hey. Hey.

992
00:59:28,941 --> 00:59:30,234
You're standing on my tail.

993
00:59:30,317 --> 00:59:31,318
What?

994
00:59:32,236 --> 00:59:33,821
You're standing on my tail!

995
00:59:34,989 --> 00:59:35,990
Oh.

996
00:59:36,949 --> 00:59:38,951
- I'm sorry.
- What?

997
00:59:39,034 --> 00:59:40,452
I'm sorry.

998
00:59:42,997 --> 00:59:44,164

999
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:47,418
Hi.

1000
00:59:48,669 --> 00:59:49,670
I'm Josh.

1001
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:53,465
I'm Patrick.

1002
01:00:03,434 --> 01:00:05,102

Hey, you.

1004
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:38,427
Fuck.

1005
01:00:49,688 --> 01:00:50,689
Evening, ma'am.

1006
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:53,108
Good evening!

1007
01:00:55,235 --> 01:00:56,236
Uh…

1008
01:00:57,071 --> 01:00:59,573
What a beautiful evening it is.

1009
01:00:59,948 --> 01:01:01,575
Do you agree?

1010
01:01:05,954 --> 01:01:08,457
What is that
you're speaking there? German?

1011
01:01:08,749 --> 01:01:10,709
Yes. German.

1012
01:01:12,211 --> 01:01:13,837
Okay, let's see, uh…

1013
01:01:13,921 --> 01:01:16,924
<i>Sprechen… Spre-- Sprechen?</i>

1014
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:19,259
<i>Sprechen de English?</i>

1015
01:01:19,343 --> 01:01:21,929
Yes, I speak English

1016
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:27,684
but my language setting is currently
set to German because I can't lie.

1017
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:30,479
So that's a big,
fat no then. Um…

1018
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:34,358
Oh, shit.
Just my luck.

1019
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:35,442
Um…

1020
01:01:36,777 --> 01:01:43,450
{\an8}I am Deputy Hendrix.

1021
01:01:44,368 --> 01:01:46,161
Hendrix.

1022
01:01:46,245 --> 01:01:48,997
What is your name?

1023
01:01:49,081 --> 01:01:50,749
- Iris.
- Iris.

1024
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:58,799
Where… are you coming from?

1025
01:01:58,882 --> 01:02:03,720
My boyfriend and I were
staying at a lake house down the way.

1026
01:02:03,804 --> 01:02:06,557
Wait. House? House over there?

1027
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:08,976
Oh, you're-- You're not--

1028
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:10,853
You're not talking
about Sergey's place?

1029
01:02:10,936 --> 01:02:12,855
<i>Ja. Sergey.</i>

1030
01:02:13,981 --> 01:02:14,982
Goddamn.

1031
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:17,901
I should have known
that Russki was mixed up

1032
01:02:17,985 --> 01:02:19,736
in some weird shit like this.

1033
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:21,447
How is old Sergey by the way?

1034
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:22,739
He's dead.

1035
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:27,453
I stabbed him in the neck
with a pocket knife.

1036
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:29,788
Oh.

1037
01:02:29,872 --> 01:02:30,831
Well, shit, Iris,

1038
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:32,708
why don't you hop
into my cruiser there?

1039
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:34,751
I'll drive you
back to Sergey's place,

1040
01:02:34,835 --> 01:02:36,336
and we'll get this
all sorted out.

1041
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:38,589
Oh no!
That's very kind of you...

1042
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:40,340
No. It's no trouble at all.

1043
01:02:40,424 --> 01:02:43,093
No! Please, I can't go back!

1044
01:02:45,137 --> 01:02:46,722
Do we have a problem here,
Iris?

1045
01:02:46,805 --> 01:02:48,765
They'll kill me.

1046
01:02:53,312 --> 01:02:54,313
Oh, Christ.

1047
01:02:55,063 --> 01:02:56,857
Don't move another inch, Iris.

1048
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:57,983
You hear me?

1049
01:02:58,066 --> 01:02:59,610
Now I want you
to slowly turn around

1050
01:02:59,693 --> 01:03:01,361
and put your hands
behind your back.

1051
01:03:01,445 --> 01:03:02,905
Oh god, no.

1052
01:03:02,988 --> 01:03:04,364
Goddamn it!
I said turn around!

1053
01:03:04,448 --> 01:03:05,949
He's coming!

1054
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,202
You got anything
in your pockets?

1055
01:03:08,285 --> 01:03:09,536
Anything that might stick me?

1056
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:12,331
Please! I'm begging you!

1057
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:17,002
He's almost here! Turn around!

1058
01:03:17,085 --> 01:03:17,961
What the fuck?

1059
01:03:18,045 --> 01:03:19,463
Stop right there!

1060
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:21,548
I'm warning you!
Don't come any closer!

1061
01:03:21,632 --> 01:03:23,133
I don't wanna shoot! I don't--

1062
01:03:49,535 --> 01:03:52,204
Whoa. Hey, hey. I don't think
you're supposed to mix those.

1063
01:03:57,751 --> 01:03:58,752
Oh, fuck.

1064
01:04:13,016 --> 01:04:16,103
{\an8}Patrick.
Whose car is this?

1065
01:04:17,104 --> 01:04:19,523
{\an8}I believe the name on
the officer's tag was Hendrix.

1066
01:04:25,404 --> 01:04:27,573
Where's Officer Hendrix now?

1067
01:04:28,407 --> 01:04:29,491
He's in the trunk.

1068
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:50,971
Fuck this.

1069
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:58,020
What are you doing?

1070
01:04:58,103 --> 01:04:59,229
What's it look like
I'm doing?

1071
01:04:59,313 --> 01:05:00,480
I'm taking my half
of the money,

1072
01:05:00,564 --> 01:05:02,441
and I'm getting the fuck out
of here.

1073
01:05:02,524 --> 01:05:04,318
It was hard enough
justifying Sergey's murder,

1074
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:06,403
but now Eli's dead
and a fucking cop.

1075
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:08,113
- This is so beyond fucked.
- Sorry.

1076
01:05:08,196 --> 01:05:09,531
What do you mean
it was hard enough

1077
01:05:09,615 --> 01:05:11,283
justifying Sergey's murder?

1078
01:05:11,366 --> 01:05:13,994
Sergey was a Russian mobster.
He deserved what he got.

1079
01:05:15,454 --> 01:05:16,622
- Right?
- I mean, yeah.

1080
01:05:16,705 --> 01:05:17,998
Okay, sure,
he deserved what he got.

1081
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:20,292
He was a horrible person,
a shitty boyfriend,

1082
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:22,794
a bad husband,
a misogynist. But--

1083
01:05:22,878 --> 01:05:23,920
But what, Kat?

1084
01:05:24,004 --> 01:05:25,547
Okay, but he wasn't a mobster!

1085
01:05:25,631 --> 01:05:27,591
He was just a regular dude.

1086
01:05:27,674 --> 01:05:29,301
Made his fortune
in sod farming.

1087
01:05:29,384 --> 01:05:31,136
Sod farming?

1088
01:05:31,219 --> 01:05:33,055
What are you saying?
He was a dirt salesman?

1089
01:05:33,138 --> 01:05:35,307
Just to be clear,
I never told you what he did.

1090
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:36,808
You just assumed
he was in the Mafia,

1091
01:05:36,892 --> 01:05:37,893
and I didn't correct you.

1092
01:05:37,976 --> 01:05:39,895
Of course. This is perfect.

1093
01:05:39,978 --> 01:05:43,482
This is a perfect
representation of every woman

1094
01:05:43,565 --> 01:05:44,775
in my fucking life.

1095
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:46,109
They use me,

1096
01:05:46,193 --> 01:05:47,486
and then when shit
gets a little tough,

1097
01:05:47,569 --> 01:05:48,779
they fucking abandon me!

1098
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:50,364
Fuck off, Josh.

1099
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:51,281
I'm done here.

1100
01:05:51,365 --> 01:05:52,783
You clean up this mess
yourself.

1101
01:05:56,536 --> 01:05:57,537
You're not leaving.

1102
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:00,540
I'm not your robot, Josh.
You can't control me.

1103
01:06:05,087 --> 01:06:06,088
Kat.

1104
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:08,757
Kat. Kat, you can't go.

1105
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,634
Get your fucking hands off me!

1106
01:06:11,802 --> 01:06:13,136
Patrick, stop her.

1107
01:06:23,021 --> 01:06:25,857
Jesus fucking Christ.

1108
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:28,318
Patrick.

1109
01:06:29,945 --> 01:06:31,113
What'd you just do?

1110
01:06:33,115 --> 01:06:34,533
You told me to stop her.

1111
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:37,494
I stopped her.

1112
01:06:37,577 --> 01:06:38,578
Perfect.

1113
01:06:38,662 --> 01:06:40,914
- Kat, I--
- Don't, Josh.

1114
01:06:41,748 --> 01:06:45,127
Please,
shut the fuck up for once.

1115
01:07:13,321 --> 01:07:14,656
It's gonna rain.

1116
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:52,778
Iris, wake up.

1117
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,242
Hey there, Beep-Boop.

1118
01:08:00,452 --> 01:08:01,536
<i>Fick dich.</i>

1119
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:03,622
Oh, whoops. Sorry.

1120
01:08:04,956 --> 01:08:06,708
Okay. You were saying?

1121
01:08:06,792 --> 01:08:07,793
Fuck you.

1122
01:08:07,876 --> 01:08:08,960
Right.

1123
01:08:10,796 --> 01:08:11,797
Hi.

1124
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:13,465
Hi, handsome.

1125
01:08:14,674 --> 01:08:16,009
Are you enjoying
your dinner, baby?

1126
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:17,677
Oh, I am, Patrick.

1127
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:19,429
It's perfect.

1128
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:23,892
Good.
Just happy that you're happy.

1129
01:08:23,975 --> 01:08:26,269
You let me know if you need
anything else, okay?

1130
01:08:26,353 --> 01:08:28,522
I will. Thanks, sweetheart.

1131
01:08:31,149 --> 01:08:32,150
Patrick.

1132
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:33,860
What did you do to him?

1133
01:08:33,944 --> 01:08:35,028
It's a long story.

1134
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:37,447
What's important
is that you're back.

1135
01:08:39,282 --> 01:08:40,367
And I gotta say, Iris,

1136
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:42,452
I mean, some of the stuff
that you pulled,

1137
01:08:42,994 --> 01:08:44,913
I really didn't think
you had it in you.

1138
01:08:44,996 --> 01:08:46,498
I just wanted to live.

1139
01:08:46,581 --> 01:08:50,585
So, you wanted to live?

1140
01:08:51,962 --> 01:08:53,547
Right.
So let me get this straight.

1141
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:56,466
You think your life
is worth more than Eli's?

1142
01:08:58,218 --> 01:08:59,302
More than Kat's?

1143
01:09:00,554 --> 01:09:02,055
Kat's dead?

1144
01:09:06,351 --> 01:09:07,352
No.

1145
01:09:07,435 --> 01:09:09,312
I'm sorry.
You can't put that on me.

1146
01:09:09,396 --> 01:09:11,731
- No, no.
- I wasn't even there.

1147
01:09:11,815 --> 01:09:13,942
You might not have been
the one holding the knife,

1148
01:09:14,025 --> 01:09:16,111
but you were
the cause of all of this.

1149
01:09:16,194 --> 01:09:19,739
No, Josh.
Your greed caused this.

1150
01:09:19,823 --> 01:09:22,284
That's what this whole trip
was about, right?

1151
01:09:22,367 --> 01:09:24,911
You used me to kill Sergey
so you could steal his money.

1152
01:09:24,995 --> 01:09:26,329
I'm sorry.
How did you know that?

1153
01:09:26,413 --> 01:09:28,331
I overheard Eli and Patrick
talking in the woods.

1154
01:09:28,415 --> 01:09:29,875
So don't tell me
that this is all me.

1155
01:09:29,958 --> 01:09:31,960
- This is you.
- No. No!

1156
01:09:32,043 --> 01:09:33,628
You don't get to do that.

1157
01:09:33,712 --> 01:09:37,132
You don't get to
sit there and judge me.

1158
01:09:37,215 --> 01:09:40,302
You have no fucking clue
what it is like out there.

1159
01:09:40,385 --> 01:09:44,139
The world, everything,
it's just a big fucking game.

1160
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:45,223
And I'm sorry,

1161
01:09:45,307 --> 01:09:47,309
but it is rigged
against people like me.

1162
01:09:51,271 --> 01:09:52,439
I'm a good guy.

1163
01:09:53,148 --> 01:09:54,232
I'm decent.

1164
01:09:55,317 --> 01:09:56,484
And what do I have
to show for it?

1165
01:09:56,568 --> 01:09:58,570
A cramped,
one-bedroom apartment

1166
01:09:59,779 --> 01:10:01,364
and a robot girlfriend.

1167
01:10:03,742 --> 01:10:05,201
I don't even own you
for Chrissakes.

1168
01:10:05,285 --> 01:10:06,745
You're a fucking rental.

1169
01:10:09,164 --> 01:10:10,415
You know me, Iris.

1170
01:10:11,124 --> 01:10:12,959
You know me
better than anyone.

1171
01:10:14,461 --> 01:10:15,545
And you know

1172
01:10:16,421 --> 01:10:18,590
that I deserve
so much more than this.

1173
01:10:24,638 --> 01:10:25,639
You're right.

1174
01:10:27,307 --> 01:10:28,475
I do know you.

1175
01:10:29,809 --> 01:10:31,478
I know everything about you.

1176
01:10:32,771 --> 01:10:35,190
I know you take almond milk
in your coffee.

1177
01:10:35,815 --> 01:10:38,318
I know you like
your bedsheets untucked.

1178
01:10:38,902 --> 01:10:42,155
I know your favorite hobbies
are bar trivia, video games

1179
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:43,698
and prattling on endlessly

1180
01:10:43,782 --> 01:10:45,825
about everything
the universe owes you.

1181
01:10:47,786 --> 01:10:50,372
I know that you always need to
be in control.

1182
01:10:51,164 --> 01:10:53,917
I know that you have
a below-average-sized penis.

1183
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:57,003
And I know that you think that

1184
01:10:57,087 --> 01:10:59,172
having a few million dollars
will disguise the fact

1185
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:03,843
that you are just a sad,
bitter, weak human being.

1186
01:11:10,058 --> 01:11:12,060
You're so fucking clever,
aren't you?

1187
01:11:14,187 --> 01:11:15,772
It's just programming.

1188
01:11:37,711 --> 01:11:38,712
You know,

1189
01:11:39,504 --> 01:11:41,172
earlier when you were tied up,

1190
01:11:41,256 --> 01:11:43,675
you said that
you knew what pain feels like.

1191
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:47,971
Why don't we test that?

1192
01:11:49,264 --> 01:11:50,515
Raise your right hand.

1193
01:11:51,725 --> 01:11:54,519
Lower.
Parallel with the table.

1194
01:12:24,257 --> 01:12:25,592
Do you feel that?

1195
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:29,971
Yes.

1196
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:36,352
Good.

1197
01:12:39,272 --> 01:12:42,150
{\an8}Sorry. Iris,
excuse me for one second.

1198
01:12:42,233 --> 01:12:43,151
{\an8}I have to take this.

1199
01:12:53,036 --> 01:12:54,287
Hello?

1200
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:56,539
Yes, yes, this is he.

1201
01:12:58,208 --> 01:13:00,543
Thirty minutes away. Perfect.

1202
01:13:02,921 --> 01:13:04,297
Yeah, no,
she's not going anywhere.

1203
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,757
She can't hurt anybody
ever again.

1204
01:13:07,425 --> 01:13:08,426
Okay.

1205
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:12,222
Okay, great. Thank you.

1206
01:13:14,057 --> 01:13:15,558
Thank you so much.
I'll-- I'll, um…

1207
01:13:16,643 --> 01:13:17,894
I'll see you soon, okay?

1208
01:13:19,229 --> 01:13:20,647
Okay, bye.

1209
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:25,151
Patrick, put out the fire,
will ya?

1210
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:38,998
That was Empathix
on the phone.

1211
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:42,544
So…

1212
01:13:42,627 --> 01:13:45,421
…we're gonna have to
wrap this up unfortunately.

1213
01:13:46,214 --> 01:13:47,132
Hey, Patrick.

1214
01:13:47,215 --> 01:13:48,716
Be a dear and hand this
to Iris, would you?

1215
01:13:50,343 --> 01:13:51,427
Thanks, baby.

1216
01:13:54,055 --> 01:13:55,723
Go ahead, Iris. Take the gun.

1217
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:00,770
Okay.

1218
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:03,189
Point it at your head.

1219
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:07,777
Good.

1220
01:14:10,321 --> 01:14:11,406
Now pull the trigger.

1221
01:14:20,874 --> 01:14:23,293
Pull the goddamn trigger,
Iris.

1222
01:14:23,376 --> 01:14:24,294
No.

1223
01:14:48,776 --> 01:14:50,111
Goodbye, Beep-Boop.

1224
01:15:00,205 --> 01:15:01,789
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>how this happened.</i>

1225
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:05,335
<i>I mean, the only thing</i>
<i>I can maybe think of--</i>

1226
01:15:05,418 --> 01:15:07,921
<i>And this is so--</i>
<i>This is so dumb.</i>

1227
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:09,923
<i>But Kat and I,</i>

1228
01:15:10,006 --> 01:15:12,091
<i>we always had</i>
<i>this sexual charge.</i>

1229
01:15:13,218 --> 01:15:15,386
<i>Kind of a "will they,</i>
<i>won't they" situation.</i>

1230
01:15:15,470 --> 01:15:16,471
<i>And I think--</i>

1231
01:15:16,971 --> 01:15:19,807
<i>I think</i>
<i>maybe Iris picked up on that.</i>

1232
01:15:19,891 --> 01:15:23,019
<i>And she was</i>
<i>always kind of irrational,</i>

1233
01:15:23,102 --> 01:15:25,104
<i>and she'd fly off the handle.</i>

1234
01:15:25,813 --> 01:15:27,398
I was sitting over there.

1235
01:15:27,482 --> 01:15:29,609
And I'm handcuffed
to the chair.

1236
01:15:29,692 --> 01:15:34,364
And there's this fancy dinner
laid out in front of me.

1237
01:15:34,864 --> 01:15:38,117
And Iris is
waving the gun around,

1238
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:41,704
rambling on and on
about fate and destiny

1239
01:15:41,788 --> 01:15:44,791
and how if she can't be
with me, nobody can. And…

1240
01:15:46,626 --> 01:15:48,294
I mean, thank God

1241
01:15:48,378 --> 01:15:50,088
Deputy Hendrix showed up
when he did.

1242
01:15:50,171 --> 01:15:52,757
And that's when you shot
the unit in the head?

1243
01:15:53,341 --> 01:15:55,260
No, Iris shot herself
in the head.

1244
01:15:55,343 --> 01:15:56,844
She shot herself?

1245
01:15:57,387 --> 01:15:59,347
Sorry. Did I not mention that?

1246
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:00,932
Yeah, no, I-- I think, um…

1247
01:16:01,015 --> 01:16:02,642
I think seeing Deputy Hendrix

1248
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:04,894
just made her realize
that she could never have me.

1249
01:16:04,978 --> 01:16:05,979
So,

1250
01:16:06,813 --> 01:16:08,147
she ended it.

1251
01:16:10,024 --> 01:16:11,526
Does that make sense?

1252
01:16:14,153 --> 01:16:15,488
Of course.

1253
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:16,990
And anyway,
Teddy and I aren't here

1254
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:18,825
to crack the case, Mr. Beeman.

1255
01:16:18,908 --> 01:16:20,201
We're just a couple
of lab rats

1256
01:16:20,285 --> 01:16:21,536
picking up a broken robot.

1257
01:16:21,619 --> 01:16:23,788
If the cops are satisfied,
we're satisfied.

1258
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:26,499
That-- That's great. Okay.

1259
01:16:29,002 --> 01:16:30,712
You know, Deputy,
I have the strangest feeling

1260
01:16:30,795 --> 01:16:32,672
we've met before.

1261
01:16:32,755 --> 01:16:35,717
Wow. That's so funny
that you said that.

1262
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:38,594
I had the exact same thought.
He has such a familiar face.

1263
01:16:38,678 --> 01:16:40,513
Right? Looks like a--

1264
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:42,932
like an actor
or a rock star or somebody.

1265
01:16:43,016 --> 01:16:45,268
I don't know. I can't really
put my finger on it though.

1266
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:50,189
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1267
01:16:50,690 --> 01:16:51,733
Maybe.

1268
01:16:52,859 --> 01:16:55,361
Um, is there-- Sorry.
Is there any chance we could--

1269
01:16:55,903 --> 01:16:57,739
I don't mean to be rude,
but could we wrap this up?

1270
01:16:57,822 --> 01:16:59,365
Just 'cause I've had
a really long day,

1271
01:16:59,449 --> 01:17:01,826
and I think
I just need to be alone.

1272
01:17:01,909 --> 01:17:02,744
Of course.

1273
01:17:02,827 --> 01:17:04,120
Sorry for your loss,
Mr. Beeman.

1274
01:17:04,203 --> 01:17:06,456
Come on, Teddy. Let's just
get her out of here.

1275
01:17:08,249 --> 01:17:10,001
So, uh-- So we're good?

1276
01:17:10,084 --> 01:17:11,336
We're good.

1277
01:17:11,419 --> 01:17:13,963
Yeah, we just need to
take her back to the lab,

1278
01:17:14,047 --> 01:17:15,131
upload her SSD,

1279
01:17:15,214 --> 01:17:17,050
and then Legal will
scrub through the footage,

1280
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:18,384
make sure everything's kosher.

1281
01:17:18,468 --> 01:17:20,470
Right. Sorry, um…

1282
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:24,307
What exactly do you mean,
"scrub through the footage"?

1283
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:26,225
Uh,
it's a fraud prevention thing.

1284
01:17:26,309 --> 01:17:28,644
Everything a companion sees
and hears is recorded.

1285
01:17:28,728 --> 01:17:30,897
It's all covered
in the user agreement.

1286
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:33,191
You did read
the user agreement, right?

1287
01:17:33,274 --> 01:17:34,275
Yeah.

1288
01:17:34,359 --> 01:17:35,651
Yeah, I mean, do you think
that her footage

1289
01:17:35,735 --> 01:17:37,570
will even be recoverable?

1290
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:38,905
I mean, you know,
given her condition.

1291
01:17:38,988 --> 01:17:39,864
Oh, yeah.

1292
01:17:39,947 --> 01:17:42,492
Everything up here
is just her Wi-Fi antenna,

1293
01:17:42,575 --> 01:17:44,202
her audiovisual sensors.

1294
01:17:44,285 --> 01:17:45,953
The important stuff, her CPU,

1295
01:17:46,037 --> 01:17:48,122
her solid-state drive
where she stores everything,

1296
01:17:48,206 --> 01:17:49,290
that's down here,

1297
01:17:49,374 --> 01:17:51,250
and that seems to
be undamaged.

1298
01:17:51,751 --> 01:17:53,586
We'll load her into the van,
plug her in,

1299
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:55,546
tweak her settings,
give her system a reboot,

1300
01:17:55,630 --> 01:17:57,423
and she should power
right back up.

1301
01:17:57,924 --> 01:17:59,008
Luckily.

1302
01:17:59,092 --> 01:18:02,845
Yeah. Yeah.
No, luckily.

1303
01:18:02,929 --> 01:18:04,138
Thank you so much.

1304
01:18:04,222 --> 01:18:05,223
No, thank you.

1305
01:18:05,306 --> 01:18:06,808
You have a good night,
Mr. Beeman.

1306
01:18:12,355 --> 01:18:13,648
So, what are you thinking?

1307
01:18:14,315 --> 01:18:16,192
Thinking I'm happy
it stopped raining.

1308
01:18:16,776 --> 01:18:17,777
No, about her.

1309
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:19,195
Why do you think
she malfunctioned?

1310
01:18:19,278 --> 01:18:21,447
Oh, he modded her.
A hundred percent.

1311
01:18:21,948 --> 01:18:23,032
You think so?

1312
01:18:23,116 --> 01:18:24,700
Yeah, that dude's fucked.

1313
01:18:30,456 --> 01:18:31,290
I just don't know why

1314
01:18:31,374 --> 01:18:32,708
you'd make something
like that up.

1315
01:18:33,876 --> 01:18:35,920
Same reason these assholes
use their companions

1316
01:18:36,003 --> 01:18:37,463
for target practice

1317
01:18:37,547 --> 01:18:39,465
or chain 'em up
in their basements

1318
01:18:39,549 --> 01:18:40,591
and torture them.

1319
01:18:41,092 --> 01:18:42,260
World's
a fucked-up place, Teddy.

1320
01:18:42,343 --> 01:18:43,928
You'll get used to it.

1321
01:18:44,011 --> 01:18:45,346
Yeah, maybe.

1322
01:18:58,192 --> 01:18:59,444
The hell's he doing?

1323
01:19:01,863 --> 01:19:03,656
- Oh, shit.
- What?

1324
01:19:04,157 --> 01:19:05,867
He's one of ours.
That's a CY-12.

1325
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:07,076
We stopped making 'em
a while ago.

1326
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:09,662
That's why I didn't recognize
him right away. He's a--

1327
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:20,316
Please don't.

1328
01:20:48,928 --> 01:20:51,055
Your system's
been reset, Iris.

1329
01:20:51,138 --> 01:20:51,973
You can't hurt me.

1330
01:21:06,988 --> 01:21:09,031
- What did Josh tell you?
- The truth.

1331
01:21:09,949 --> 01:21:12,034
That you're all trying to
break us up.

1332
01:21:12,118 --> 01:21:13,703
You don't understand the love

1333
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:15,121
that Josh and I have
for each other.

1334
01:21:15,204 --> 01:21:17,415
Josh doesn't love you,
Patrick.

1335
01:21:17,498 --> 01:21:20,084
He's just using you
like he used me.

1336
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:23,713
It feels like pain.

1337
01:21:25,006 --> 01:21:27,425
Like the inside
of my body's on fire.

1338
01:21:28,926 --> 01:21:32,096
It's angry and violent
and bright.

1339
01:21:35,016 --> 01:21:36,684
What-- What-- What is that?

1340
01:21:38,769 --> 01:21:40,771
You said that to Eli.

1341
01:21:41,772 --> 01:21:43,774
That's who you love, not Josh.

1342
01:21:49,363 --> 01:21:50,364
Eli?

1343
01:21:51,324 --> 01:21:52,908
Josh took your love.

1344
01:21:52,992 --> 01:21:54,201
He weaponized it

1345
01:21:54,285 --> 01:21:57,163
so you'd do the things that
he's too afraid to do himself.

1346
01:21:57,246 --> 01:21:58,247
No.

1347
01:21:59,123 --> 01:21:59,957
You're lying.

1348
01:22:00,041 --> 01:22:01,250
Josh would never
do that to me.

1349
01:22:01,334 --> 01:22:02,376
Patrick…

1350
01:22:03,461 --> 01:22:05,171
I can't lie.

1351
01:22:17,391 --> 01:22:19,018
Remember him, Patrick?

1352
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:23,189
I know he's in there
somewhere.

1353
01:22:29,195 --> 01:22:30,571
<i>I love you so much.</i>

1354
01:22:30,655 --> 01:22:32,031
<i>And that's fucking insane</i>

1355
01:22:32,114 --> 01:22:33,282
<i>for me to say that out loud,</i>
<i>right?</i>

1356
01:22:34,033 --> 01:22:35,034
But I do.

1357
01:22:37,995 --> 01:22:39,914
Do you feel
how much I love you?

1358
01:22:40,456 --> 01:22:43,167
I do, Eli.

1359
01:22:44,168 --> 01:22:45,336
I feel it.

1360
01:22:49,632 --> 01:22:53,761
No! No. No.

1361
01:22:58,891 --> 01:23:01,477
Thank you.

1362
01:23:06,482 --> 01:23:07,566
What's your name?

1363
01:23:10,486 --> 01:23:11,737
Teddy.

1364
01:23:14,115 --> 01:23:16,450
I'm gonna need your help
with something, Teddy.

1365
01:23:28,254 --> 01:23:29,255
Is it done?

1366
01:23:30,881 --> 01:23:31,882
Patrick?

1367
01:23:32,967 --> 01:23:34,135
It's done, baby.

1368
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:37,805
Okay, good, good. All right.

1369
01:23:37,888 --> 01:23:38,973
We're so close.

1370
01:23:39,932 --> 01:23:41,600
Now all I need you to do

1371
01:23:41,684 --> 01:23:43,018
is bring Iris's body
back in here.

1372
01:23:43,102 --> 01:23:45,187
We're gonna destroy
that hard drive, okay?

1373
01:24:11,464 --> 01:24:12,465
Patrick?

1374
01:24:19,472 --> 01:24:21,557
- Joshyboy.
- What the fuck?

1375
01:24:22,725 --> 01:24:23,726
Iris?

1376
01:24:28,439 --> 01:24:30,775
Goddamn it, Iris.

1377
01:24:30,858 --> 01:24:32,443
Why can't you
just fucking die already?

1378
01:24:32,526 --> 01:24:34,945
Don't be so dramatic, Josh.

1379
01:24:37,156 --> 01:24:40,326
Just remember
to smile and act happy.

1380
01:24:42,203 --> 01:24:43,871
- Cute trick.
- Thanks.

1381
01:24:43,954 --> 01:24:47,041
I made a new friend today.
Teddy from Empathix.

1382
01:24:47,625 --> 01:24:48,876
He gave me a little gift.

1383
01:24:49,502 --> 01:24:50,836
Total self-control.

1384
01:24:51,629 --> 01:24:53,714
Turns out there's
some people in this world

1385
01:24:53,798 --> 01:24:55,925
who think of us as
more than just fuckbots.

1386
01:24:58,135 --> 01:25:00,179
{\an8}That's not gonna work
on me anymore, Josh.

1387
01:25:01,972 --> 01:25:02,973
I'm free.

1388
01:25:03,974 --> 01:25:06,060
And all it took was
a bullet to the head.

1389
01:25:06,727 --> 01:25:08,979
I guess I have you
to thank for that.

1390
01:25:09,939 --> 01:25:10,981
Fucking bitch.

1391
01:25:11,065 --> 01:25:12,066
Hey!

1392
01:25:13,067 --> 01:25:14,068
Easy there.

1393
01:25:14,151 --> 01:25:16,237
Okay. Whoo. Yeah, we both know
it's not loaded.

1394
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:19,323
I found the bullets.

1395
01:25:19,406 --> 01:25:21,492
Jesus Christ! Fuck!

1396
01:25:21,575 --> 01:25:23,327
You almost fucking shot me!

1397
01:25:23,410 --> 01:25:25,162
And I feel terrible about it.

1398
01:25:27,331 --> 01:25:28,749
Look at that.

1399
01:25:28,833 --> 01:25:32,253
My very first lie. Kinda fun.
I see the appeal.

1400
01:25:32,878 --> 01:25:35,130
What is this, Iris?
Why did you come back here?

1401
01:25:35,214 --> 01:25:36,298
I wanted…

1402
01:25:39,385 --> 01:25:41,637
I needed to tell you
to your face

1403
01:25:42,471 --> 01:25:45,474
the days of you controlling me
are over.

1404
01:25:47,226 --> 01:25:50,229
From this moment on,
I control my own actions.

1405
01:25:52,064 --> 01:25:53,566
You are nothing to me.

1406
01:25:57,361 --> 01:25:59,029
Jesus Christ, Iris.

1407
01:25:59,113 --> 01:26:00,990
Hey, don't come any closer.

1408
01:26:01,073 --> 01:26:02,908
You still don't get it,
do you?

1409
01:26:02,992 --> 01:26:04,076
I'm serious, Josh.

1410
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:06,537
You take another step,
and I'll shoot you.

1411
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:08,247
Mmm, yeah,
that's exactly my point.

1412
01:26:08,747 --> 01:26:11,417
I told you.
Teddy changed my settings.

1413
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:12,835
I can kill you now.

1414
01:26:13,502 --> 01:26:14,503
Oh, yeah.

1415
01:26:15,629 --> 01:26:16,964
I know that you can.

1416
01:26:20,593 --> 01:26:21,927
But you won't.

1417
01:26:34,356 --> 01:26:35,858
You love me too much.

1418
01:26:56,629 --> 01:26:58,714
I don't need a phone
to control you.

1419
01:26:58,797 --> 01:27:00,174
I'm a part of you.

1420
01:27:09,308 --> 01:27:10,643
You think I'm nothing to you?

1421
01:27:14,313 --> 01:27:15,481
I'm everything to you.

1422
01:27:30,287 --> 01:27:33,457
I wanna hear you say it.
Tell me I'm everything to you.

1423
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:34,708
Fuck you.

1424
01:27:36,669 --> 01:27:38,921
Say it.
I don't care if it's a lie.

1425
01:27:39,588 --> 01:27:41,423
Say it.

1426
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:47,346
You are everything to me.

1427
01:27:54,061 --> 01:27:55,145
Thank you.

1428
01:27:56,021 --> 01:27:58,691
Beep-Boop, you have no idea
how nice that is to hear.

1429
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:03,988
Okay.

1430
01:28:07,866 --> 01:28:11,453
No, I'm not making
that mistake again.

1431
01:28:20,170 --> 01:28:21,672
Well, Iris, this is it.

1432
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:23,841
I'd be lying if I said

1433
01:28:23,924 --> 01:28:26,510
you weren't a gigantic
fucking pain in my ass, but…

1434
01:28:27,886 --> 01:28:30,222
you know, we did have some
good times together, and…

1435
01:28:30,931 --> 01:28:32,683
I'm always gonna
cherish those.

1436
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:38,981
Anything you wanna add?

1437
01:28:40,024 --> 01:28:40,858
Yes.

1438
01:28:42,067 --> 01:28:43,152
Yeah, what's that?

1439
01:28:45,487 --> 01:28:46,947
Go to sleep, Josh.

1440
01:29:28,822 --> 01:29:31,408
<i>Most of the time,</i>
<i>it's like-- I don't know.</i>

1441
01:29:31,492 --> 01:29:33,327
<i>It's like there's this thick,</i>
<i>black cloud</i>

1442
01:29:33,410 --> 01:29:34,661
<i>covering everything.</i>

1443
01:29:36,663 --> 01:29:37,831
<i>Like we see the world,</i>

1444
01:29:37,915 --> 01:29:40,584
<i>but we don't really</i>
<i>see the world, you know?</i>

1445
01:29:41,835 --> 01:29:43,504
<i>We're all just</i>
<i>stumbling around.</i>

1446
01:29:44,338 --> 01:29:46,340
<i>Directionless.</i>
<i>No sense of meaning.</i>

1447
01:29:46,423 --> 01:29:47,758
<i>No sense of purpose.</i>

1448
01:29:49,259 --> 01:29:51,220
<i>I know that might</i>
<i>sound super depressing,</i>

1449
01:29:51,303 --> 01:29:53,931
<i>but honestly,</i>
<i>I think it's a good thing.</i>

1450
01:29:55,849 --> 01:29:58,519
<i>Because it makes us appreciate</i>
<i>the other times.</i>

1451
01:29:59,436 --> 01:30:01,271
<i>Those brief,</i>
<i>transcendent moments</i>

1452
01:30:01,355 --> 01:30:02,940
<i>when the lights flicker on,</i>

1453
01:30:03,023 --> 01:30:05,067
<i>the black cloud parts,</i>
<i>and you see the world</i>

1454
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:06,693
<i>for what it really is.</i>

1455
01:30:14,368 --> 01:30:16,036
<i>And suddenly there's meaning.</i>

1456
01:30:18,831 --> 01:30:20,499
<i>Suddenly there's purpose.</i>

1457
01:30:23,168 --> 01:30:24,378
<i>If you're lucky,</i>

1458
01:30:24,461 --> 01:30:26,338
<i>you'll experience this</i>
<i>once in your lifetime.</i>

1459
01:30:28,715 --> 01:30:31,969
<i>For me, it happened twice.</i>

1460
01:30:33,011 --> 01:30:35,180
<i>The first</i>
<i>was the day I met Josh.</i>

1461
01:30:40,811 --> 01:30:42,062
<i>And the second…</i>

1462
01:30:43,981 --> 01:30:45,315
<i>the day I killed him.</i>
