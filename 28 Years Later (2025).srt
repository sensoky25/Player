1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000

3
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:40,873
Over the hills and far away...

4
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:45,378
...Teletubbies come to play.

5
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,255
One.
One.

6
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:49,715
- Two.
- Two!

7
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,511
- Three.
- Three!

8
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:57,390
Four!

9
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:00,893
And the Teletubbies
love each other very much.

10
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,770
Aw.

11
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:05,274
Big hug.

12
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,741
It's not allowed.

13
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,493
Why did you take so long?
They're not coming by.

14
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,287
Doesn't matter,
it doesn't matter!

15
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:20,955
Where are the others?
They were right behind me.

16
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:22,164
Time for Teletubbies.

17
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,249
Let's take
all the kids in one car.

18
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,376
Time for Teletubbies.

19
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,920
Sit here. Sit!

20
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,255
Auntie, what's going on?

21
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:30,589
Jimmy, sit still, keep quiet,

22
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,508
and do not move
from this spot.

23
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,927
We have got to get
the kids into the car!

24
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,220
What were you doing?

25
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,556
- I told you to hurry up!
- For God's sake!

26
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,100
Uh-oh!

27
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,562
Jimmy?

28
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,815
Uh-oh!

29
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:51,402
What is that?

30
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,240
Where have
the Teletubbies gone?

31
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,667
Dad?

32
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,628
- ♪ Tinky Winky ♪
- ♪ Tinky Winky ♪

33
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,756
♪ Dipsy ♪

34
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,267
Jimmy, run.

35
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,935
- Mum?
- Run! Run!

36
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,405
Run!

37
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:37,991
Run! Jimmy, run!

38
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,493
Go!

39
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,122
Dad! Dad!

40
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:53,840
Dad!

41
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:01,932
Dad!

42
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:03,766
Dad!

43
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,976
Jimmy.
Dad.

44
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,520
Dad, what's happening?

45
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,106
Nothing that hasn't been
most perfectly foretold.

46
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,399
I'm so scared, Dad.

47
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,109
I think Mum and sis
might be dead.

48
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,278
Oh, no, son.

49
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,363
Not dead.

50
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,532
Saved.

51
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,785
For this is a glorious day.

52
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,870
The day of judgment.

53
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,961
Here, my son.

54
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,383
Keep this with you always.

55
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,594
Have faith.

56
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:46,601
Yes.

57
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,646
Yes, my children!

58
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,690
Yes!

59
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,830
Yes!

60
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,379
Father,

61
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,007
why have you forsaken me?

62
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:35,710
It's your big day, Spike.

63
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,462
Up you get.

64
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,187
See ya later.

65
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,286
Got your torch?

66
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,705
Jumper, whistle...

67
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:37,540
water bottle?

68
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:39,876
Here y'are.

69
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,129
Got your knife?

70
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:45,882
Good lad.

71
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,307
Put that away.

72
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,105
We're having bacon?
For breakfast?

73
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:03,316
Dave and Rosey
brought it round last night.

74
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,070
Where's yours?

75
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,863
Had some already,
while I was cooking.

76
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:10,949
Yeah, right.

77
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,661
Spikey.

78
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,038
It's all yours.

79
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,636
I'll go see to your mum.

80
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,388
You finish up.

81
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:35,807
Put your plate on the side.

82
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,106
I'm coming, love.

83
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:45,608
Here y'are, love.

84
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:47,819
What's the matter, what's up?

85
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:54,700
Jamie...

86
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,702
You've got
to ride it out, love.

87
00:08:56,703 --> 00:09:00,248
- You gotta stay here and rest.
- Oh, I can't. No.

88
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,249
Oh, Spikey.

89
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,500
Hiya, Mum.

90
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,044
Oh, me baby.

91
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,755
You know,
I didn't mean to make a fuss.

92
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:10,340
- It's me head. It's...
- It's okay.

93
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,551
It's just pounding.

94
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,054
Oh, why don't you tell me
how school was today?

95
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,141
I haven't been to school, Mum.

96
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,809
It's the morning.

97
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:21,894
Is it?

98
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,520
Uh, yeah,

99
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,106
it's the morning, and, uh...

100
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,233
Isla...

101
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,568
d'you remember?

102
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,361
Spike's not going
to school today.

103
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,655
Why not?

104
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,158
Is it the weekend already?

105
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,660
Nah, it's Friday.

106
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,331
So why isn't
he going to school?

107
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,167
We spoke about this.

108
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,376
Few times.

109
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,420
Spoke about what, Jamie?

110
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,173
Me and Spike
are going out.

111
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,342
It's his first time.

112
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,635
First time?

113
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,345
Do you mean
you're going off the island,

114
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,138
to the mainland?

115
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,015
- Yeah.
- What?

116
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,099
Isla.

117
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,226
What the fuck
are you talking about?

118
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:03,560
All right.
Don't swear. Come on.

119
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,604
Have you gone
fucking crazy?

120
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,730
He's a fucking baby!

121
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,106
- Mum...
- He's twelve.

122
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,733
Are you trying to kill
our fucking baby, you cunt?

123
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,109
Spike, will you go back
downstairs, please?

124
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,694
You crazy fucking
sick baby-murderer.

125
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,196
No, Dad, you go down.

126
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:15,322
- If me dad was still here...
- No, I'm telling you.

127
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,490
...he'd skin you alive,
baby-murderer!

128
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:17,449
It'll be better if...
All right!

129
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,492
- Cunt!
- All right. Isla,

130
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:19,785
- it's all right.
- Cunt!

131
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,038
- All right. He'll be fine.
- Cunt!

132
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,165
- Mum...
- No.

133
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,417
It's me.

134
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,796
Spike... Spikey.

135
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,216
Oh, what's going on? I'm hot.

136
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,218
Why... Why am I
feeling so hot?

137
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:37,594
It's just the weather, Mum.

138
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,013
So hot.

139
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,100
It's all right.

140
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,145
I got you some breakfast.

141
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,732
It's a bit of bacon.

142
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,485
Eat a bit
when you feel like it.

143
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:56,613
Are you off?

144
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,324
- Yeah.
- Where?

145
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,078
- School.
- Oh.

146
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,124
Okay, Spikey.

147
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,376
Oh, I love you.

148
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,296
I love you, too, Mum.

149
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,218
Morning, kiddo.

150
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,636
Sam.

151
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,306
Just restrung this for you.

152
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:23,849
Did it need a restring?

153
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,518
Nope. Did it
for my own sake, really.

154
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,021
He'll be fine, Sam.

155
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,063
Have a draw, son.

156
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,149
Feel the weight.

157
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,112
Hold it.

158
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,781
No shake at all.

159
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,324
Strong lad.

160
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:43,077
Howay then, son. Let's go.

161
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,544
All right.
All right.

162
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,046
I'll see you tonight.

163
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,839
- Lives are at stake.
- Cheers, lads.

164
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,883
- Go on, Jamie!
- Good luck, Spike.

165
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,301
Glad you're getting on now,
Spike.

166
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,510
Go on, Spike!

167
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,678
You go well, lad.

168
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,311
This is from Mum.

169
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,896
- Thanks, Betty.
- Your big party tonight,

170
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,857
our Spike. Don't be late!

171
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,442
Bring him back safe, yeah?

172
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,735
Come on, Jamie!

173
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,873
Look after him, Jamie!

174
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,416
Good luck, Spike.

175
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,502
All right, Jacob.

176
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,055
Look at that, Spike.

177
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,974
You got the whole
leadership committee.

178
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,601
You just smile and be polite.

179
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,104
Had to see you off.

180
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,355
We're all excited for you.

181
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,273
Even though you know
I feel he's a bit young.

182
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,901
Fourteen or fifteen is more
in keeping with practice.

183
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,361
He's ready, Jenny.

184
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:00,446
Go on, lad.

185
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,866
You know the rules
of our community, Spike.

186
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,410
If you leave,
you can come back.

187
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:07,911
But if you don't come back,

188
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,330
no one is permitted
to go and find you.

189
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,126
There are no rescues.
No exceptions.

190
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,962
It was something
we learned the hard way...

191
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,340
On account of all the people
we lost in the past.

192
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,802
So once you walk
onto that mainland,

193
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,930
you're on your own.
You understand?

194
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,641
Yes, Jenny.

195
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,522
You seen anything
this morning, Ant?

196
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,648
Nothing.

197
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,942
Fully quiet.

198
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,776
All clear?

199
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,070
All clear.

200
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,242
Open up for them.

201
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:51,998
Good lad.

202
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,637
Mind how you go,
lads. Don't miss the tide.

203
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:12,434
Seven, six, eleven, five,

204
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,019
nine-and-twenty mile today

205
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,521
Four, eleven, seventeen,

206
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,856
thirty-two the day before

207
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:21,693
Boots, boots, boots, boots,

208
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,361
moving up and down again!

209
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,947
There's no discharge
in the war!

210
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,783
So, what's this, Spike?

211
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,409
It's the causeway.

212
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,494
Talk us through it.

213
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,954
It's the only way
to the mainland.

214
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,166
But we can only get here
in low tide.

215
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,085
In high tide,
the sea covers it.

216
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:40,212
Can we swim it
in high tide?

217
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,714
No.
The sea has a current.

218
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:46,344
It'll push us past the island
and pull us out to sea,

219
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:47,886
and we'll drown.

220
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,347
Don't, don't, don't,

221
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,724
don't look
at what's in front of you...

222
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:56,436
Boots, boots, boots, boots,

223
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,938
moving up and down again

224
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:01,108
Men, men, men, men,

225
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:03,026
men go mad with watchin' em...

226
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,196
We'll have four hours
before high tide.

227
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:07,990
Are we doing this?

228
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:10,492
Can't go back now, Dad.

229
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:11,993
Why?

230
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,370
Everyone'll think I'm soft.

231
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,705
Aye, they will.

232
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,749
Can't have that, can we?

233
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,126
Come on, then.

234
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,920
Count, count, count,

235
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,422
count the bullets
in the bandoliers.

236
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,676
If your eyes drop,

237
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,094
they will get atop of you!

238
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:32,597
Boots, boots, boots, boots,

239
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,307
moving up and down again

240
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:37,936
There's no discharge
in the war!

241
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,647
This is where
we get all the fuel.

242
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,649
You'll be working here
one day.

243
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,111
Ain't so bad by day

244
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,487
because o' company,

245
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:50,323
But night brings long

246
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,117
strings
o' forty thousand million

247
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:55,537
Boots, boots, boots, boots,

248
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,038
moving up and down again.

249
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,748
It's so big.

250
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,750
If we kept walking,

251
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:03,379
would we get to a place
where you can't see the sea?

252
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,338
Wey aye.

253
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,175
You'll walk for days or weeks
without seeing the coast.

254
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:10,219
There's nothing out there,
Spikey.

255
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,512
Nowhere to aim for.

256
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,889
There's other villages.

257
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,974
Aye, but none have
anything we don't have.

258
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,809
And we stay out
the towns and villages.

259
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,020
I have marched

260
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,313
- six weeks...
- Howay.

261
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,898
...in hell an' certify

262
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:25,317
It is not fire,

263
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,194
devils, dark, or anything,

264
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:30,780
but boots, boots,
boots, boots,

265
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,575
moving up an' down again.

266
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,082
Try, try, try...

267
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,793
...try to think
of something different

268
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,962
Oh, my God,

269
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,381
keep me from going lunatic!

270
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:51,968
Boots, boots, boots, boots,

271
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,887
moving up and down again!

272
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:57,433
There's no discharge
in the war!

273
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,783
There, look, look, look,
look, look, look.

274
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:16,786
Slow-low.

275
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,580
Not fast.

276
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,458
Doesn't mean
they aren't dangerous.

277
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,877
And if there's one visible,

278
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,214
probably a couple more
in the trees.

279
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,884
Your bow

280
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,220
isn't strong enough
for the chest.

281
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,598
You need to hit it
right in the neck.

282
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,393
Okay, Dad.

283
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,399
You scared?

284
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,651
Only a little bit.

285
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,445
Are you?

286
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:53,531
No. I'm good.

287
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,576
You like this range?

288
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,036
I think so.

289
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,497
Let's go get your first kill.

290
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,600
Get him in your sight.

291
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,193
Calculate for wind.

292
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,613
All right.

293
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:36,990
He's yours.

294
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:39,576
Anything that comes out
after him is mine.

295
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:40,745
Send when ready.

296
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,791
Send it.

297
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:21,994
Dad!

298
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,541
Get in here!
Hey!

299
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,546
Beautiful kill, Spike.

300
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,297
You feel good?

301
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,340
Yeah, I think so.

302
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,634
Aye, you should.

303
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:38,761
I'm proud of ya.

304
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,346
Now come on, we gotta move.

305
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,514
The screaming
would have alerted

306
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,849
the other infected
in the area.

307
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,520
Go on. Let's keep going.

308
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:42,533
They're amazing.

309
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,785
They're beautiful.

310
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:50,749
Here.

311
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:53,335
Check this out.

312
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:01,802
Good lad.

313
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:26,117
Shit.

314
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,919
It's always worth looking
around for summat useful.

315
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,422
People would have searched
this place a hundred times,

316
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,716
but you never know.

317
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:52,728
Fuckin' hell.

318
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,442
Oh.

319
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:01,820
Are these useful?

320
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,656
Nah. Got plenty of that.

321
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:05,741
But this is.

322
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:07,910
What is it?

323
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:10,495
A frisbee.

324
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,080
You never seen
a frisbee before?

325
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,415
Aw, it's great.

326
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,792
You're gonna love it.

327
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,655
Come here, son.

328
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,126
Don't look away, Spike.

329
00:22:58,002 --> 00:22:59,377
- Dad, please.
- Spike!

330
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,713
Do as I tell ya.

331
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,176
There's a lesson for you here.

332
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,156
What happened to him?

333
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:31,160
Looks like he got tied up
and left for the infected.

334
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,829
And now he's infected.

335
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:35,664
He's infected?

336
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,085
Aye.

337
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,671
Why would anyone do that?

338
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,715
Maybe a punishment.

339
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:48,802
Maybe a warning.

340
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:53,557
There are strange people
on the mainland.

341
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:56,392
Roaming.

342
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,854
That's why our home
is so precious.

343
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:03,192
Is that the lesson?

344
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:04,735
No.

345
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:08,238
Kill it.

346
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,993
The more you kill,
the easier it gets.

347
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,289
Don't feel bad about it.

348
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,209
The infection
takes away their minds.

349
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,921
It's got no mind,
it's got no soul.

350
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:33,972
Spike.

351
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:36,684
Kill the bloody thing.

352
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:39,186
Kill it!

353
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,564
What are you waiting for,
Spike?

354
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,191
Now, son!

355
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:46,151
Spike, finish it!

356
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:49,738
For Christ's sake, Spike,
fuckin' kill it!

357
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:00,082

the fast ones, Spikey.

373
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:48,231
You smell that?

374
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:49,316
It's the intestines.

375
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:53,403
I weirdly like it.

376
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,710
Dad.

377
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,796
Dad.

378
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:38,782
What?

379
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,828
An Alpha did that.

380
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,747
This way, Spike. Come on.

381
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,083
Spike! Move it!

382
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,379
We're going back?

383
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,133
Aye. Got your kills,
that's what we came for.

384
00:27:57,718 --> 00:27:58,968
Won't it look like
we left early?

385
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:01,512
Don't talk, Spikey.
Just keep your eyes peeled.

386
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,102
Looks clear.

387
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:08,812
Let's go.

388
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:26,371
Stay really still.

389
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,143
Alpha.

390
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:50,394
Fuck.

391
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,646
Get back to the trees.

392
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,231
Get back, let's go.

393
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:54,816
Dad!

394
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,832
Let's go!

395
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:18,089
Move, move.

396
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,217
Keep moving.
Let's go, let's go!

397
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:25,013
Here, defense.
Get your breath back.

398
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:26,597
I'll take the first,

399
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,141
- you take the second.
- Yeah.

400
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,185
Slow your breathing.

401
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,979
Slow it down.

402
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,856
Shit!

403
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:45,032
Go! Move, move, move!

404
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,201
Just go!

405
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:48,495
Fuck!

406
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:53,375
Right, two-man drill. Defense!

407
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,133
Right. Shoot!

408
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:05,387
Head and heart.
Head and heart, Spike.

409
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:15,647
Get in there.

410
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,233
Go up!

411
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,614
- Go on, son!
- Come on, Dad!

412
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:26,908
Where?

413
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,245
Shit.

414
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,122
Da, what...?

415
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:34,416
The loft!
Check the loft!

416
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,130
Oi. Come here.

417
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:45,593
Go on.

418
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:46,844
I can't get back up.

419
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,306
- Oh, fuck.
- Dad! Dad!

420
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,940
Push!

421
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:04,946
Oh, fuck.

422
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:13,622
Fuckin' hell.

423
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:57,207
Mind your backs, boys.

424
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,042
Coming through!

425
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,336
Tea time.

426
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,672
Tea time. Well done today.

427
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,549
Great stuff.

428
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:08,385
Chop chop before it gets dark.

429
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,361
It's waitin'.

430
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:30,072
Alphas aren't like the others.

431
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:33,201
Not just bigger. Smarter.

432
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:35,203
What are we gonna do?

433
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,372
Well, we're not fighting it.

434
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,334
I've got no arrows left.

435
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,837
And anyway...

436
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:47,549
I've seen it take a dozen hits
to drop one of those things.

437
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:51,261
So, we'll wait, too.

438
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:56,057
I'm really sorry, Dad.

439
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:58,185
What? What about?

440
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,061
This is all my fault.

441
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:03,147
- I couldn't hit anything.
- What are you talking about?

442
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:06,066
I tried but I was too scared.
And I kept missing.

443
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,152
What are you talking about?
This is not your fault.

444
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:10,154
And you kept shooting.

445
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:12,156
I've seen adults who canna get
an arrow in the bow,

446
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,616
they're shaking so hard.

447
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:15,827
Not you. Hey, hey, hey...

448
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:19,080
Spike, you did well.

449
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:21,750
Honestly.

450
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,215
We're gonna miss
the low tide.

451
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:30,883
Yeah. Yeah.
Aren't we?

452
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:32,344
There'll be another.

453
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:45,482
Hey, look out to sea.

454
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,151
Here.

455
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:52,489
Just there.

456
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:55,450
Quarantine patrol.

457
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:57,744
Probably French.

458
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,265
Dad...

459
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,475
What's that?

460
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:29,525
Fire.

461
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:31,236
Something's burning?

462
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:33,154
Yeah.

463
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:34,823
Something.

464
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,701
Is it another village?

465
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:40,495
Nope.

466
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:43,622
What is it then?

467
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:46,209
I don't know.
I've never been there.

468
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:48,627
Does it always burn?

469
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,714
I just said
I've never been there, Spike.

470
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,539
Spike.

471
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,208
Spike.

472
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,585
There she is.

473
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:30,961
Spike, I'm drowning.

474
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:55,278
Get out! We gotta get out!

475
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:57,280
Oh, fucking hell.

476
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:00,657
Get up! Get up, Spike!

477
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,951
- Get your bum down.
- Wake up, we've gotta move!

478
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:11,336
It's all right, son.
It's all right.

479
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,421
Aah! Fuckin' hell!

480
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,052
What happened?

481
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:21,970
Old building.

482
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,848
I dunno.
Chimney fuckin' died on us.

483
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,058
The noise will bring 'em.

484
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:27,935
We gotta move.

485
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:30,271
Is it low tide?
It'll be low enough.

486
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,190
We move fast but quiet.

487
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,275
If you see the Alpha,
just run straight

488
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,778
for the causeway
and over it. All right?

489
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:40,155
You stop for nothing! Go on!

490
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,367
- Where will you be?
- Right behind you.

491
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,969
No sign of the Alpha.

492
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,262
It's still high tide.

493
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:04,555
Only just.

494
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,641
The water will be shallow.
But we can make it.

495
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,322
Shin-deep.
We're good. All right.

496
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:23,408
Take your boots off.

497
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:26,327
Aye. Line up the gates.

498
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:28,871
That's our path.

499
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:32,040
It's okay. Just breathe.

500
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,751
Here. Let's go.

501
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:35,795
You go first.

502
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,051
Go on, son.

503
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:07,242
How about that day, Spike, eh?

504
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,827
First time to the mainland.

505
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:11,872
First kill. First run-in
with the infected.

506
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:15,292
Saw an Alpha!

507
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,461
And missed the tide.

508
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:19,463
I've got so much
to tell Mum when we get back.

509
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:39,692
Dad.

510
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,612
Run, Spike!

511
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:44,906
Run!

512
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:48,159
Go! Go, keep going!

513
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:55,875
Keep moving!

514
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,003
- Oh! Oh, God! Get up!
- Dad, I can't!

515
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,674
- I can't!
- Spike! Get up, now!

516
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:06,511
Spike, go! Go, go, Spike!

517
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:08,220
Fucking go!

518
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,518
I can't!

519
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:15,895
Yes, you can!

520
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:21,943
Oh, shit!

521
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:27,490
Incoming!

522
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,283
Open up!

523
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:35,456
Help! Jenny! Jenny!

524
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:38,667
Wakey, wakey!
Up, up, up!

525
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:41,962
Incoming!

526
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:43,422
- Wakey, wakey, boys.
- Ant, who is it?

527
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:44,881
- Everyone up! Eyes on!
- Form up, boys! Get ready!

528
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:47,176
Eyes on, eyes on!
Incoming!

529
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,309
Alpha!

530
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,979
Open up! Fucking open up!

531
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,480
Alpha! Alpha!

532
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,232
Fuckin' Alpha,
get that light on!

533
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,275
Keep the fuckin' light on him!

534
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:05,653
Fire!
Get down!

535
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,580
Go, go, go, go, Spike!
Go, go.

536
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:17,998
Keep
that fuckin' light on him.

537
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:20,500
Load it, load it, load it!

538
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,920
Oh, fuck.
This is it, Spike.

539
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:24,797
Breathe!

540
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:31,012

I didn't expect to see you
until past midnight.

601
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,456
Just came to see me mum.

602
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:30,918
How was she? She all right?

603
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:33,337
She's better than all right.

604
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:35,881
We were up and about.

605
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:37,465
We walked to the fields.

606
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:40,428
She's got a lotta life in her
when she's not having a turn.

607
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:44,181
But what about your day? Eh?

608
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:46,683
More to the point.

609
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,727
Dad's made it out
to be something it's not.

610
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:50,021
Like what?

611
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:51,688
Like I'm a hero.

612
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,816
I expect you are, to him.

613
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:56,861
Just feels like he's lying.

614
00:44:57,904 --> 00:45:00,197
So what did happen out there?

615
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:03,575
- I shot one of the fat ones.
- Ah.

616
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:05,660
It was hardly moving.

617
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:08,080
But then we got chased
by some of the fast ones,

618
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:10,333
and I couldn't hit a thing.

619
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:14,253
Then we just hid
until it got dark.

620
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,548
I was just scared.

621
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:19,967
Felt sick.

622
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:23,595
I wanted to be home
with me mum.

623
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:25,514
Your dad
probably felt the same.

624
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:33,271
Tell you what, though,
never seen so much land.

625
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:34,689
- Mm.
- It was so big.

626
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,232
What did you see?

627
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:38,069
Well, hills...

628
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:39,528
Forests...

629
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,531
And a fire.

630
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:45,993
A fire?

631
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:51,790
I wonder if you saw
old Kelson.

632
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:54,001
Didn't imagine
he was still alive.

633
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:58,005
Was it southwest?

634
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:03,010
Christ. That'll be Kelson.

635
00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:08,390
Believe it or not,

636
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:10,601
he used to be my GP

637
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,520
some 30 year back.

638
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:15,730
- What's a GP?
- A doctor.

639
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:17,691
- A doctor?
- Aye.

640
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:20,569
Had his practice
just outside Whitley Bay.

641
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:26,366
Dad said that he didn't know
what the fire was.

642
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:29,035
And he says
all the real doctors are dead.

643
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:31,330
That's why no one knows
what's wrong with Mum.

644
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,958
Just feels like
he's lying about everything.

645
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:37,253
Nah. You know what?

646
00:46:40,006 --> 00:46:42,049
He probably
didn't wanna spook you.

647
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:44,510
Dr. Kelson is...

648
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,222
odd.

649
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:49,640
How is he odd?

650
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,269
What's so special
about the fire?

651
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:55,854
If your dad
doesn't wanna talk about it,

652
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:57,273
I don't think I should.

653
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:03,279
Why don't you go back
to your party? Eh?

654
00:47:04,697 --> 00:47:06,156
I'm fine here wi' your mum.

655
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:07,241
No.

656
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:08,909
You go.

657
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:11,579
I'll look after her now.

658
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:16,417
Okay.

659
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:24,925
Got ya.

660
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,577
They're all lying, Mum.

661
00:48:03,506 --> 00:48:05,633
Spike, will you go
to the shops for us?

662
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,469
I need some Nurofen.

663
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:12,722
Nurofen?

664
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,642
It's me head. It's just...

665
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:22,023
Never mind. It doesn't matter.

666
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:24,692
Hello!

667
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:26,320
We're up here, love.

668
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:31,908
Well, that was some party.

669
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,910
Absolute carnage.

670
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,161
You look...

671
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:36,246
You look like you've been

672
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:38,165
dragged through
a hedge backwards.

673
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:40,084
Maybe I did.

674
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,961
I woke up in a wheat field.

675
00:48:42,962 --> 00:48:46,047
And where did you
disappear to, Spikey?

676
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:49,426
Looked around and the guest
of honor had vanished.

677
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:51,594
Just came home.

678
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,556
Hey, giant-killer.

679
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:14,201
I'll make some breakfast.

680
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:28,506
What's going on, Spike?

681
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,466
Why didn't you tell us
there was a doctor

682
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:31,552
that could see Mum?

683
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:33,053
Doctor?

684
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:35,638
We don't have a doctor.

685
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:36,807
Haven't had a doctor here
in forever.

686
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:38,975
Dr. Kelson, Dad.

687
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:40,977
The fire. On the mainland.

688
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,521
Who've you been talking to?

689
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:45,357
So he is a doctor.

690
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:47,067
Was it Sam?

691
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:48,569
Bloody fool.

692
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:50,738
Putting ideas in your head.

693
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:55,241
He's not a doctor, Spike.

694
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:58,078
Maybe he once was. Years ago.

695
00:49:58,871 --> 00:50:01,248
But he's long
since gone insane.

696
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:03,417
What do you mean?

697
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:06,378
Is he a doctor or not?

698
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,424
Before you were born,

699
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,509
we used to forage.

700
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:15,011
But it got harder, you know,

701
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,387
so you'd have
to travel further.

702
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:18,682
And one day, it took a group
of us close to Kelson's.

703
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,227
Right?

704
00:50:21,936 --> 00:50:24,104
Aye. 500 yards out,

705
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:26,732
we started to smell death.

706
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:29,817
Now understand, we were
well used to that smell.

707
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:31,612
Back then,
the dead were everywhere.

708
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:33,739
But this...

709
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:36,116
this was totally different.

710
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:39,286
This stench was like...

711
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:42,580
it was like a wall.

712
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:43,874
You could touch it.

713
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:48,629
And we got
to the brow of this hill,

714
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:50,839
and we looked down...

715
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:56,803
I've never seen
anything like it.

716
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:00,599
Corpses.

717
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:02,517
Hundreds.

718
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:09,275
Just arranged in lines.

719
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:13,195
Men, women, children.

720
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:16,282
And in the middle,
was this fire.

721
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:19,743
Stood by it, was Kelson.

722
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:24,330
For some unfathomable purpose,

723
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:26,292
he'd dragged
all the bodies there.

724
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:28,584
And a few seconds later,

725
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:31,087
he turned around
and he looked right at us

726
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,588
and he waved.

727
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:35,509
Casually, like,
"Hey. Wanna come down, lads?"

728
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:40,764
Yeah. We turned and ran.

729
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:43,350
And in 15 years,

730
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:45,853
none of us have been back.

731
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,523
Like I said.

732
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:51,899
Insane.

733
00:51:55,738 --> 00:51:58,365
Oh, fuck.

734
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:02,494
Do you want Mum to die?

735
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,706
'Course I don't.

736
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:10,460
Ah, Spike,
what sort of question is that?

737
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:12,254
What's really wrong with her?

738
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:18,635
I don't know.

739
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,221
Is she dying?

740
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:25,642
I don't know.

741
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:28,896
I think she's dying.

742
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:31,357
And so do you.

743
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:34,734
If she dies,

744
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:36,528
are you gonna be with Rosey?

745
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,280
Watch your mouth.

746
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,990
What would her Davey
think about that?

747
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,910
I said,
watch your bloody mouth!

748
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:47,205
Son...

749
00:52:47,206 --> 00:52:48,749
Jamie!

750
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:51,293
Spike!

751
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:59,759
Oh, it's pounding, Spike.
Pounding.

752
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,387
I know, Mum. I'm sorry.

753
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:08,560
Need some water, love?
I'll go get you some.

754
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:12,272
Get the fuck away from us.

755
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,274
"From us"?

756
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:20,572
You heard us.

757
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,468
Just go away, Dad.

758
00:54:25,888 --> 00:54:26,889
There's a fire!

759
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:29,682
There's a... Run!

760
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:31,767
Fuckin' smoke, look.
Ant, Mark!

761
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,519
- There's a fire!
- Go, go, go on! Go on!

762
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,021
There's fire
in the main barn!

763
00:54:35,022 --> 00:54:36,147
You've got to go!

764
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:37,816
I can't leave the gate, Spike.

765
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:40,443
You have to.

766
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:42,278
That's why they sent me.

767
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:45,156
I'll be on the siren.
But you've gotta go now.

768
00:54:45,157 --> 00:54:47,116
They need every man,
they said!

769
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,618
- Go!
- For fuck's sake.

770
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:50,953
Hurry. Go.
Fuckin'...

771
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,455
Keep your eyes on the horizon.

772
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:54,458
And stay on that siren!

773
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,459
Gonna get more water!

774
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,420
Fetch more water!

775
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:02,883
Fire!

776
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:06,928
Get more water. Go!

777
00:55:06,929 --> 00:55:07,970
Fire!

778
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:14,937
Come on, Mum. Let's go.

779
00:55:15,521 --> 00:55:16,646
Get water! Water!

780
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:18,397
Get some more water
from the sea!

781
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:19,733
Where are we going?

782
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:21,317
The beach.

783
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,152
And the fields.

784
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,571
- We're going to the beach?
- Yeah.

785
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:58,480
This is the mainland.

786
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:01,566
Yeah.

787
00:56:01,567 --> 00:56:02,859
But we can't...

788
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,612
We can't be on the mainland.

789
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:07,989
It's too dangerous. It's...

790
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:09,532
- It's okay, Mum.
- No.

791
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:11,701
- I know how to keep us safe.
- No, no, no, this isn't right.

792
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:14,203
It's not right. Where's...?

793
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,664
Jamie?

794
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:17,541
Where's...

795
00:56:19,293 --> 00:56:20,668
Where's Dad?

796
00:56:20,669 --> 00:56:22,878
- Dad's not here.
- Then we...

797
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,922
Then we have to go back now.
Back home.

798
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:26,007
We have to run, or we...

799
00:56:26,008 --> 00:56:27,092
Mum...

800
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:30,595
We can't go back. Tide's in.

801
00:56:30,596 --> 00:56:32,806
Oh, God.

802
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,850
Going to see a doctor.

803
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:37,184
What? A doctor?

804
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:38,477
- A real doctor.
- No.

805
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:40,354
From the old days.

806
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:42,024
Something wrong with you, Mum.

807
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:46,820
The doctor's
gonna make you better.

808
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:51,658
Okay?

809
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,076
Okay.

810
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:46,755
Okay, Mum.

811
00:57:47,506 --> 00:57:49,132
We'll stop here for the night.

812
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:52,593
We'll stay there.

813
00:58:12,114 --> 00:58:13,240
Is your dad silly?

814
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:20,496
- Dad?
- Yeah.

815
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,582
Silly with ya. Jokey.

816
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,671
Your granddad was so silly.

817
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:30,590
You wouldn't believe how much.

818
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:35,303
Everyone else thought
he was so serious...

819
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:38,098
but around me, he was daft.

820
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,144
Is your dad like that...

821
00:58:43,562 --> 00:58:45,147
you know, when it's just
the two of you?

822
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:48,275
No.

823
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:53,196
Just wanting to make sure
you're tough enough.

824
00:58:54,406 --> 00:58:55,615
Like him.

825
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:01,788
You know,
when I look in your face...

826
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:05,292
I see your granddad's eyes.

827
00:59:06,168 --> 00:59:07,210
It's nice.

828
00:59:12,424 --> 00:59:13,717
Exactly.

829
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:27,939
You should get some sleep.

830
00:59:29,775 --> 00:59:32,194
I'm gonna stay awake.
Keep watch.

831
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:33,820
Okay, Dad.

832
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:04,554
What?

833
01:02:07,766 --> 01:02:09,059
What happened?

834
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:11,478
I don't know.

835
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:14,940
Here.

836
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:19,027
Gotta go.

837
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:28,568
Oh, look.

838
01:06:30,445 --> 01:06:31,236
The Angel.

839
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:35,658
Do you remember the first time
you showed me the angel, Dad?

840
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:40,288
We drove near here.

841
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:42,415
Left the car.

842
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:47,670
We walked until we spotted it
rising over the treetops.

843
01:06:49,214 --> 01:06:51,299
You said it would stand
like this forever.

844
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:55,010
Like the pyramids.
Or Stonehenge.

845
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:56,637
So when you look at it, you...

846
01:06:56,638 --> 01:06:59,348
You're seeing into the future.
Do you remember that day?

847
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:02,685
I couldn't have been more
than, what, seven or eight?

848
01:07:04,229 --> 01:07:07,648
Us two are real-life
time travelers, you said.

849
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:11,110
Fallen into the future.

850
01:07:12,904 --> 01:07:14,447
And I got...

851
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:17,200
I got scared.

852
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:21,703
Because I thought
you were being serious

853
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:23,581
and we really had.

854
01:07:26,668 --> 01:07:29,295
How many hundreds of years
have we fallen this time?

855
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:33,174
Is it thousands or more?

856
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:34,842
Mum?

857
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:41,307
Spike.

858
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:43,476
Your nose is bleeding again.

859
01:07:56,656 --> 01:07:57,657
Keep still.

860
01:07:59,117 --> 01:08:00,326
Don't move.

861
01:08:03,246 --> 01:08:04,497
Keep still.

862
01:08:09,127 --> 01:08:10,585
No, no, no!

863
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:12,338
Wait! Don't blink!

864
01:08:13,131 --> 01:08:14,340
You're fine.

865
01:08:20,013 --> 01:08:22,180
Shit. Come on, Mum!

866
01:08:26,686 --> 01:08:28,187
Keep going, Mum!

867
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:32,191
Don't stop!

868
01:08:36,988 --> 01:08:39,282
Run! Run!

869
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:43,660
Don't stop, Mum! Get in!

870
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:44,829
Go, Mum, go!

871
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:55,882
Get inside! Get inside!

872
01:08:57,759 --> 01:08:59,218
Get inside!

873
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,220
Fuck! Fuck!

874
01:09:06,476 --> 01:09:09,186
Go! In! Get in!

875
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,606
Spike, I can't breathe.

876
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:13,900
Spike, it's gas!

877
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:17,819
- Can't breathe!
- No, Mum!

878
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:18,946
- No, Mum!
- Don't...

879
01:09:28,915 --> 01:09:30,249
Get off her!

880
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:33,419
Spike...

881
01:09:34,754 --> 01:09:35,922
Spikey!

882
01:09:37,632 --> 01:09:38,673
Get off her!

883
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:49,684
Get down! Now!

884
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:50,894
Go on!

885
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:40,569
What happened?

886
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:43,905
Benzene.

887
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:45,324
Vaporized.

888
01:10:46,033 --> 01:10:47,493
Built up over the years.

889
01:10:51,122 --> 01:10:52,247
Oh.

890
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:53,499
I'm Spike.

891
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:56,878
And this is me mum.

892
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:00,006
I'm Erik.

893
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:16,689
What's wrong with her?

894
01:11:17,857 --> 01:11:18,900
I don't know.

895
01:11:20,443 --> 01:11:21,736
I'm taking her to a doctor.

896
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:25,363
Right.

897
01:11:25,364 --> 01:11:26,657
What happens now?

898
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:28,200
What do you mean?

899
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:29,618
Well, you live here,
don't you?

900
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:32,037
On this fucking island.
You're a... You're a native.

901
01:11:32,038 --> 01:11:33,163
- A native?
- Hey,

902
01:11:33,164 --> 01:11:34,789
what the fuck happens now?

903
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:36,291
Do more infected come?

904
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:38,043
I don't know. Probably.

905
01:11:38,044 --> 01:11:39,377
They would've heard the noise.

906
01:11:39,378 --> 01:11:41,129
Of course, they'll come.

907
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:42,631
The barsark will come.
They'll rip

908
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:44,549
our fucking heads off.
Do you understand?

909
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:47,260
- You're not from here.
- Will you shut her up, please?

910
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:48,803
Wait, where are you from?

911
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:50,347
I'm from Sweden,
now can you make her shut up?

912
01:11:50,348 --> 01:11:52,474
- She can't help it.
- She... She can't help it?

913
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:53,767
You can't help me?

914
01:11:53,768 --> 01:11:56,061
Why the fuck
did I help you, huh?

915
01:11:56,062 --> 01:11:58,397
I could've saved my bullets!

916
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:04,528
I gotta get outta here.

917
01:12:04,529 --> 01:12:06,822
- I'm gonna leave.
- Well, you can go.

918
01:12:07,532 --> 01:12:08,907
I'm not leaving her.

919
01:12:08,908 --> 01:12:11,368
Thank you, Daddy.

920
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:13,787
Jesus Christ. Can this get
any more fucked up?

921
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:19,544
Fuck's sake.

922
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:24,798
My best friend from school
is a delivery driver.

923
01:12:24,799 --> 01:12:26,841
You don't know what
a delivery driver is.

924
01:12:26,842 --> 01:12:28,301
He, um,

925
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:29,553
delivers packages.

926
01:12:29,554 --> 01:12:31,430
You know,
people order stuff online.

927
01:12:32,473 --> 01:12:34,140
I bet you don't know
what online is.

928
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:35,392
Uh, it doesn't matter.

929
01:12:35,393 --> 01:12:37,310
He's a... He's a driver.

930
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:38,770
And I told him...

931
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:41,106
you're wasting your life,
Felix.

932
01:12:41,107 --> 01:12:44,443
You only get one life,
and you're pissing it away.

933
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:47,070
And he said...

934
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:49,155
"Yeah, what are you gonna do,
fuck nuts?"

935
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:52,076
So I joined the navy...

936
01:12:53,077 --> 01:12:54,578
to prove a point.

937
01:12:54,579 --> 01:12:56,497
Now who's pissing away
their life, huh?

938
01:12:57,999 --> 01:12:59,541
I don't understand
what you're saying.

939
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:01,751
I'm saying I should have been
a delivery driver.

940
01:13:01,752 --> 01:13:05,046
Right now, I'd be stuck
in traffic somewhere...

941
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:08,216
or driving too fast down
a narrow street or something.

942
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:09,551
Then why are you here?

943
01:13:09,552 --> 01:13:11,554
My fucking boat sank.

944
01:13:12,972 --> 01:13:14,931
We were patrolling
on the east coast of Scotland

945
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:16,017
and we hit something.

946
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:18,227
Scotch on the rocks.

947
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:21,230
Doesn't matter.

948
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:24,441
Few of us found a life raft.

949
01:13:24,442 --> 01:13:25,900
We didn't wanna make it
to shore, obviously,

950
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:27,861
but the wind blew us.

951
01:13:27,862 --> 01:13:30,781
Eight of us made it to land.
Now I'm the only one left.

952
01:13:31,616 --> 01:13:32,866
Will you be rescued?

953
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:37,454
You do know the whole island
is in quarantine, right?

954
01:13:37,455 --> 01:13:39,706
What do you think
the patrol boats are for?

955
01:13:39,707 --> 01:13:41,916
Well, I know
there's a quarantine.

956
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:43,710
But I thought
it was only for us.

957
01:13:43,711 --> 01:13:45,295
Quarantine is
for any poor fucker

958
01:13:45,296 --> 01:13:46,964
who puts one toe
on this island.

959
01:13:48,132 --> 01:13:49,466
You hit land, you never leave.

960
01:13:53,596 --> 01:13:55,472
You can come to my town.

961
01:13:55,473 --> 01:13:57,682
After I take my mum
to the doctor.

962
01:13:57,683 --> 01:13:59,644
Yeah, where is this doctor?

963
01:14:01,312 --> 01:14:02,688
There.

964
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:05,106
Not far.

965
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:06,775
"Not far"?

966
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:09,528
Hey, hey, you try carrying
your mother around for a bit.

967
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:11,864
I'm gonna take a break.

968
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:20,790
First meal
in a day and a half.

969
01:14:24,627 --> 01:14:25,836
Have another.

970
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:31,217
Seem to really like apples.

971
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:37,890
Yeah.

972
01:14:38,891 --> 01:14:39,892
One percent.

973
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:42,561
No signal.

974
01:14:46,273 --> 01:14:47,274
What's that?

975
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,610
Soon, it's a brick.

976
01:14:50,611 --> 01:14:53,488
But for a few
more moments it's...

977
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:55,240
something like a radio.

978
01:14:55,241 --> 01:14:56,325
But with photos.

979
01:14:57,451 --> 01:14:58,661
Do you have radios?

980
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:01,330
Do you have photos?

981
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:03,999
Some people have old ones.

982
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:08,003
There.
Take a look at that.

983
01:15:09,255 --> 01:15:10,256
That's a new one.

984
01:15:12,383 --> 01:15:13,425
It's my fiancee.

985
01:15:13,426 --> 01:15:14,719
Or ex...

986
01:15:15,261 --> 01:15:16,262
I guess.

987
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:18,639
What's wrong with her face?

988
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:20,766
What do you mean?

989
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:23,017
She looks weird.

990
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:24,352
You're weird.

991
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:25,812
She's gorgeous.
What's wrong with you?

992
01:15:25,813 --> 01:15:27,647
Tsk. I know what it is.

993
01:15:27,648 --> 01:15:29,607
There's this girl in my town
who has the same thing.

994
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:30,859
Thing?

995
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:33,445
She's allergic to shellfish.

996
01:15:33,446 --> 01:15:35,697
So, if she eats scallops,
then her whole mouth

997
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:37,950
- gets dead fat and swells up.
- Give me that.

998
01:15:40,828 --> 01:15:42,163
Yeah, there it goes.

999
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:48,627
Don't hook up with Felix.

1000
01:15:51,088 --> 01:15:52,213
Dad...

1001
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:53,841
I'm cold.

1002
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:02,683
Why does she call you "Dad"?

1003
01:16:03,684 --> 01:16:05,560
That's weird.

1004
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:08,062
I mean, I'm sure
there's a lot of inbreeding

1005
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:09,231
around these parts...

1006
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:12,902
but this seems unlikely.

1007
01:16:14,195 --> 01:16:15,653
She's just confused.

1008
01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:17,238
She wasn't always like this.

1009
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:19,699
Most of the time she's just
like she always was.

1010
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,243
Who's like she always was?

1011
01:16:24,205 --> 01:16:25,206
You, Mum.

1012
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:27,833
Oh.

1013
01:16:34,131 --> 01:16:35,216
Who are you?

1014
01:16:36,383 --> 01:16:37,343
I'm Erik.

1015
01:16:38,969 --> 01:16:40,470
And this is your father,
Spike.

1016
01:16:41,889 --> 01:16:43,223
What?

1017
01:16:43,224 --> 01:16:46,059
- He's just being silly, Mum.
- He's being a dick.

1018
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:47,353
Mum!

1019
01:16:48,062 --> 01:16:49,103
Sorry.

1020
01:16:49,104 --> 01:16:50,438
He saved our lives.

1021
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:52,191
I know a dick when I see one.

1022
01:16:56,195 --> 01:16:58,404
God, remind me
where we're going, again?

1023
01:16:58,405 --> 01:16:59,698
The doctor.

1024
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:02,868
Right. Okay.

1025
01:17:06,831 --> 01:17:08,082
Well, let's go.

1026
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:09,750
Mum...

1027
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:15,296
She can walk?

1028
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:22,888
Why do they get so huge?

1029
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:24,932
The barsark.

1030
01:17:27,226 --> 01:17:30,144
Well, Sam says,
on some...

1031
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:32,230
the infection kinda works
like steroids.

1032
01:17:32,231 --> 01:17:33,356
Yeah?

1033
01:17:33,357 --> 01:17:35,191
I mean, I don't know
what steroids are.

1034
01:17:35,192 --> 01:17:37,111
I'm guessing that's what
turns them Alpha.

1035
01:17:38,362 --> 01:17:41,823
Alpha. You make them
sound like stock brokers.

1036
01:17:41,824 --> 01:17:44,325
Or fucking Wall Street guys.

1037
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:46,035
What?

1038
01:17:46,036 --> 01:17:48,496
You know what barsark is?
Barsark is better.

1039
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:50,081
It's like...

1040
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:54,128
Crazy fucking
Viking warrior. You know?

1041
01:17:57,339 --> 01:17:58,840
I'm actually a Viking.

1042
01:17:58,841 --> 01:18:00,675
Maybe if I get infected,
I'll turn into one.

1043
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:05,431
What the fuck was that?

1044
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:07,348
I don't know.

1045
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:11,770
No, no, no. Hey, hey!
Where are you going?

1046
01:18:12,313 --> 01:18:13,355
I'm not leaving her.

1047
01:18:14,148 --> 01:18:15,149
Hey!

1048
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:02,487
Mum!

1049
01:19:29,348 --> 01:19:30,349
Mum!

1050
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:33,601
- Spike, wait!
- Oh, fuck.

1051
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:35,020
Mum, what are you doing?

1052
01:19:35,854 --> 01:19:36,938
Stop!
Don't touch her.

1053
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:08,386
Fucking shit! Holy fuck, shit.

1054
01:20:12,099 --> 01:20:14,642
What are you doing?
Fucking drop her.

1055
01:20:22,317 --> 01:20:24,570
Cut it, Spike.

1056
01:20:25,571 --> 01:20:26,572
Spike, cut it.

1057
01:20:29,616 --> 01:20:31,493
Right. Where?

1058
01:20:31,785 --> 01:20:32,995
Here.

1059
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:34,537
No fucking way.

1060
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:38,042
- Water.
- Yeah. Here.

1061
01:20:40,127 --> 01:20:42,045
What the actual fuck?

1062
01:20:42,046 --> 01:20:43,713
Wash your hands.

1063
01:20:43,714 --> 01:20:46,925
What the fuck?

1064
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:49,594
You're all insane.

1065
01:20:51,513 --> 01:20:53,432
Here. Well done, Spike.

1066
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:10,949
Right.

1067
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:13,077
Put it down.

1068
01:21:13,744 --> 01:21:15,745
Put it down!

1069
01:21:15,746 --> 01:21:17,872
- It's a baby.
- It's a fucking zombie baby!

1070
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:20,583
Just put it down.

1071
01:21:20,584 --> 01:21:22,376
We can't let
these fuckers breed.

1072
01:21:22,377 --> 01:21:23,419
We need to kill it!

1073
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:24,504
It's a little girl.

1074
01:21:24,505 --> 01:21:28,049
Put it on the fucking ground!

1075
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:30,384
- She doesn't look infected.
- She's not infected.

1076
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:31,803
If you don't put it
on the ground right now...

1077
01:21:31,804 --> 01:21:33,137
- Look at her eyes!
- I'll kill you both!

1078
01:21:33,138 --> 01:21:35,056
- She's not infected.
- I'll kill all of you!

1079
01:21:35,057 --> 01:21:36,475
You got five seconds.

1080
01:21:37,267 --> 01:21:38,935
- Five!
- Get up, Mum. Move!

1081
01:21:38,936 --> 01:21:40,229
Four!

1082
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:41,771
Three!

1083
01:21:47,778 --> 01:21:49,321
No!

1084
01:21:50,781 --> 01:21:51,739
No!

1085
01:21:59,498 --> 01:22:01,249
Alpha.

1086
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:03,876
Move, Mum!

1087
01:22:03,877 --> 01:22:06,088
- Move!
- Yeah. Right.

1088
01:22:06,672 --> 01:22:09,258
Shit.

1089
01:22:13,846 --> 01:22:15,139
Run, Mum!

1090
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:50,716
Mum! Get off the train!

1091
01:22:58,515 --> 01:23:00,641
Mum! Run to the smoke!

1092
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:06,480
Keep running!

1093
01:23:19,745 --> 01:23:20,953
Fuck.

1094
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:36,344
Morphine, xylazine.

1095
01:23:36,345 --> 01:23:38,639
It's extremely fast-acting.

1096
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:45,394
Excuse my appearance.
I paint myself in iodine.

1097
01:23:45,395 --> 01:23:48,398
It's an excellent
prophylactic.

1098
01:23:49,274 --> 01:23:51,525
The virus
doesn't like iodine at all.

1099
01:23:55,322 --> 01:23:56,323
Oh.

1100
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:03,913
Think I'll take this, Samson.

1101
01:24:03,914 --> 01:24:05,039
Let... Let go.

1102
01:24:09,002 --> 01:24:10,211
I call this one Samson.

1103
01:24:10,212 --> 01:24:12,797
He's lived in the area
a good three years now.

1104
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:15,216
I usually

1105
01:24:15,217 --> 01:24:17,093
keep my distance from him,
of course.

1106
01:24:17,094 --> 01:24:18,469
Sir...

1107
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:19,679
"Sir."

1108
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:20,806
Oh.

1109
01:24:21,932 --> 01:24:23,558
Such good manners. Huh.

1110
01:24:24,142 --> 01:24:25,644
Are you Dr. Kelson?

1111
01:24:26,979 --> 01:24:28,146
I am.

1112
01:24:29,982 --> 01:24:32,942
I'm Spike,
and this is me mum, Isla.

1113
01:24:32,943 --> 01:24:34,777
Spike, Isla.

1114
01:24:34,778 --> 01:24:36,862
And this is a baby.

1115
01:24:38,991 --> 01:24:40,367
We need your help.

1116
01:24:42,202 --> 01:24:43,327
Come on, then.

1117
01:24:43,328 --> 01:24:45,497
We need to go
before he wakes up.

1118
01:24:54,881 --> 01:24:56,174
What's that?

1119
01:24:59,553 --> 01:25:00,679
I've been...

1120
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:04,056
I've been waiting almost

1121
01:25:04,057 --> 01:25:07,185
13 years for someone
to ask that question.

1122
01:25:11,064 --> 01:25:14,108
I often thought
I would die here alone...

1123
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:18,237
of age or starvation
or violence...

1124
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:21,241
never having had the chance
to reply.

1125
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:25,370
Do you know the words
"Memento Mori"?

1126
01:25:27,456 --> 01:25:28,831
No.

1127
01:25:28,832 --> 01:25:32,001
It's Latin. Ironically,
it's a dead language.

1128
01:25:32,002 --> 01:25:35,380
It means "Remember Death."

1129
01:25:37,215 --> 01:25:39,425
Remember you must die.

1130
01:25:56,443 --> 01:25:57,986
This helps to keep them out.

1131
01:26:16,922 --> 01:26:18,423
There were so many dead.

1132
01:26:20,092 --> 01:26:24,262
Infected
and non-infected alike.

1133
01:26:25,972 --> 01:26:27,724
Because they are alike.

1134
01:26:28,225 --> 01:26:29,225
Here, careful.

1135
01:26:48,578 --> 01:26:52,624
Every skull
is a set of thoughts.

1136
01:26:53,834 --> 01:26:56,461
These sockets saw.

1137
01:26:58,046 --> 01:27:02,049
And these jaws
spoke and swallowed.

1138
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:04,970
This is a monument to them.

1139
01:27:06,138 --> 01:27:07,305
A temple.

1140
01:27:09,808 --> 01:27:11,600
- Sorry, sorry.
- Oh. Don't worry.

1141
01:27:11,601 --> 01:27:15,062
No, it's... it's not precious
in that way. It's, uh...

1142
01:27:16,773 --> 01:27:18,315
The structure is solid

1143
01:27:18,316 --> 01:27:21,778
but the bones
will fall apart due to...

1144
01:27:22,362 --> 01:27:25,948
time, or the elements...

1145
01:27:25,949 --> 01:27:27,617
or Spike's hand.

1146
01:27:28,201 --> 01:27:30,036
The Memento Mori is...

1147
01:27:32,247 --> 01:27:33,999
is actualized.

1148
01:27:41,339 --> 01:27:42,799
Do you know this man?

1149
01:27:44,342 --> 01:27:45,594
His name was Erik.

1150
01:27:47,095 --> 01:27:48,472
He saved our lives.

1151
01:27:49,431 --> 01:27:52,726
All right,
let's find Erik a home.

1152
01:29:13,723 --> 01:29:15,433
Keep going, that's good.

1153
01:29:18,144 --> 01:29:19,145
Good lad.

1154
01:29:21,273 --> 01:29:22,940
Alas, poor Erik.

1155
01:29:28,154 --> 01:29:29,781
Choose a place for him.

1156
01:29:55,015 --> 01:29:58,643
Very nice. Well done, Spike.

1157
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:07,694
The baby is a newborn.

1158
01:30:09,279 --> 01:30:10,697
It was from an infected.

1159
01:30:12,324 --> 01:30:13,617
But she's not infected.

1160
01:30:14,367 --> 01:30:15,785
We took her from the mother.

1161
01:30:17,662 --> 01:30:22,042
How interesting.
The magic of the placenta.

1162
01:30:24,836 --> 01:30:26,838
I'd wondered
if that might happen.

1163
01:30:28,757 --> 01:30:31,008
But she'll need milk.

1164
01:30:31,009 --> 01:30:35,013
Water will keep her alive
for a few days at most.

1165
01:30:36,306 --> 01:30:38,683
Is that why
you came to see me?

1166
01:30:39,893 --> 01:30:40,894
The baby?

1167
01:30:42,812 --> 01:30:43,813
No.

1168
01:30:47,609 --> 01:30:48,942
Take your right forefinger,

1169
01:30:48,943 --> 01:30:50,653
put it on your nose...

1170
01:30:50,654 --> 01:30:53,781
and from there, try and touch
my forefinger here.

1171
01:31:00,372 --> 01:31:01,455
Okay.

1172
01:31:09,214 --> 01:31:11,799
Isla, it would be helpful if
I could check your breasts...

1173
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:14,135
and under your arms.
Is that okay?

1174
01:31:22,686 --> 01:31:24,062
Is that tender?

1175
01:31:25,814 --> 01:31:27,857
Your feelings of confusion...

1176
01:31:29,234 --> 01:31:31,652
do they feel like episodes?

1177
01:31:31,653 --> 01:31:34,780
Phases?
Or does it feel more constant?

1178
01:31:34,781 --> 01:31:37,909
It was waves, but...

1179
01:31:39,744 --> 01:31:41,329
I think the tide's coming in.

1180
01:31:43,373 --> 01:31:45,875
I asked you
to remember a word.

1181
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:47,669
Yes.

1182
01:31:48,545 --> 01:31:50,588
Do you remember what it was?

1183
01:31:54,175 --> 01:31:56,094
A word...

1184
01:31:57,262 --> 01:31:58,846
Isla...

1185
01:31:58,847 --> 01:32:01,181
I have
no diagnostic equipment...

1186
01:32:01,182 --> 01:32:04,017
and I can't take a biopsy.

1187
01:32:04,018 --> 01:32:08,273
But from what I can observe,
I think you have cancer.

1188
01:32:10,108 --> 01:32:12,693
It may have spread
from your brain to your body,

1189
01:32:12,694 --> 01:32:15,320
or your body to your brain.

1190
01:32:15,321 --> 01:32:19,117
Either way,
it has metastasized.

1191
01:32:20,869 --> 01:32:24,371
It explains your symptoms,
and, I'm afraid...

1192
01:32:24,372 --> 01:32:27,834
the masses on your breasts
and lymph nodes.

1193
01:32:31,129 --> 01:32:33,631
I... I am very sorry.

1194
01:32:36,092 --> 01:32:38,720
When I'm confused,
I know I'm confused.

1195
01:32:40,054 --> 01:32:42,723
I feel surprised at meself,
when I...

1196
01:32:42,724 --> 01:32:44,516
you know,
when I say strange things.

1197
01:32:44,517 --> 01:32:47,645
But I say them anyway.

1198
01:32:50,815 --> 01:32:52,984
But not all of me is confused.

1199
01:32:56,738 --> 01:32:59,073
I thought it might be cancer.

1200
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:02,869
Didn't know how to tell you,
Spike.

1201
01:33:05,246 --> 01:33:06,289
I was too scared.

1202
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:11,084
I needed someone else
to tell you, but no one did.

1203
01:33:15,215 --> 01:33:16,924
I don't understand.

1204
01:33:16,925 --> 01:33:19,927
Are you saying
you can't make me mum better?

1205
01:33:19,928 --> 01:33:23,431
I wish I could. But I'm afraid
it's not possible.

1206
01:33:24,682 --> 01:33:26,767
What does that mean?

1207
01:33:26,768 --> 01:33:30,772
Is she gonna die?
Is the cancer gonna kill her?

1208
01:33:31,356 --> 01:33:32,357
Yes.

1209
01:33:35,401 --> 01:33:36,402
When?

1210
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:38,822
It's hard to say.

1211
01:33:42,492 --> 01:33:43,785
Soon.

1212
01:33:49,457 --> 01:33:50,708
Will it hurt her?

1213
01:33:51,209 --> 01:33:52,710
Spikey, me love.

1214
01:33:53,670 --> 01:33:55,296
Already hurts.

1215
01:33:56,548 --> 01:33:57,965
This can't be happening.

1216
01:33:57,966 --> 01:34:01,635
Doctor, please, please.
You must be able to help her.

1217
01:34:01,636 --> 01:34:03,136
You need a medicine. One...

1218
01:34:03,137 --> 01:34:05,514
One of the old medicines
from the hospitals.

1219
01:34:05,515 --> 01:34:07,015
If you tell us
where one was I can...

1220
01:34:07,016 --> 01:34:08,725
- I can go, and I can get it.
- Spike. Spike. Listen to me.

1221
01:34:08,726 --> 01:34:09,935
Just tell us, please.

1222
01:34:09,936 --> 01:34:12,730
There is no medicine
that can cure her.

1223
01:34:27,829 --> 01:34:29,872
Doctor... Doctor, please.

1224
01:34:33,376 --> 01:34:35,294
It was so hard to get here.

1225
01:34:37,130 --> 01:34:39,423
- So hard to find you.
- Spike, come here.

1226
01:34:39,424 --> 01:34:40,799
Now he's saying
we can't help it.

1227
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,634
- Mum.
- Come on. Come on.

1228
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:54,063
- Mum...
- Should've told ya.

1229
01:34:57,108 --> 01:34:59,861
Should've told ya.

1230
01:35:01,905 --> 01:35:03,114
Please...

1231
01:35:12,498 --> 01:35:13,541
Spike.

1232
01:35:16,878 --> 01:35:18,462
The doctor
can't make me better,

1233
01:35:18,463 --> 01:35:20,131
but he can help me.

1234
01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:22,382
I don't understand.

1235
01:35:22,383 --> 01:35:23,468
I do.

1236
01:35:24,969 --> 01:35:27,972
I want you to try
and always remember that.

1237
01:35:29,474 --> 01:35:30,975
I understand.

1238
01:35:37,523 --> 01:35:39,191
Mum. Mum?

1239
01:35:39,192 --> 01:35:41,026
You're all right.
You're all right.

1240
01:35:43,780 --> 01:35:45,989
Mum. Mum.

1241
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:48,993
Shh. Just rest. It's okay.

1242
01:35:50,495 --> 01:35:51,496
Hey.

1243
01:36:05,551 --> 01:36:07,053
Look who it is.

1244
01:36:12,475 --> 01:36:13,518
Spike...

1245
01:36:15,311 --> 01:36:16,980
Memento Mori.

1246
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:19,940
What did it mean?

1247
01:36:19,941 --> 01:36:23,735
Remember we must die.

1248
01:36:23,736 --> 01:36:25,154
And it's true.

1249
01:36:26,197 --> 01:36:28,074
There are
many kinds of death...

1250
01:36:30,952 --> 01:36:32,996
and some
are better than others.

1251
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:38,292
The best are peaceful.

1252
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:41,462
Where we leave each other
in love.

1253
01:36:42,922 --> 01:36:44,215
You love your mother.

1254
01:36:46,426 --> 01:36:47,552
I love her.

1255
01:36:48,177 --> 01:36:49,554
And Isla, you love Spike.

1256
01:36:52,223 --> 01:36:54,559
So much. Mm.

1257
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:58,062
Memento Amoris.

1258
01:36:59,939 --> 01:37:02,025
Remember you must love.

1259
01:37:12,744 --> 01:37:13,911
Isla.

1260
01:37:14,746 --> 01:37:15,746
Come.

1261
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:24,464
Stay here with the baby.

1262
01:37:25,965 --> 01:37:27,591
- Mum?
- Love ya, Spike.

1263
01:37:50,448 --> 01:37:51,449
Mum?

1264
01:39:11,112 --> 01:39:12,363
Spike.

1265
01:39:16,534 --> 01:39:18,244
Find a place for her.

1266
01:39:21,164 --> 01:39:23,040
The best one of all.

1267
01:39:40,141 --> 01:39:41,350
Mum.

1268
01:41:00,554 --> 01:41:02,013
Love you, Mum.

1269
01:41:33,045 --> 01:41:35,464
Get in! Hurry!

1270
01:41:36,382 --> 01:41:37,633
Stay down.

1271
01:41:39,051 --> 01:41:40,135
Stay still.

1272
01:43:04,678 --> 01:43:05,762
Thank you, Spike.

1273
01:43:10,101 --> 01:43:11,768
I think...

1274
01:43:11,769 --> 01:43:14,522
I think it's time
for you and the baby...

1275
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:16,982
to go home.

1276
01:43:18,901 --> 01:43:19,902
Yeah.

1277
01:43:23,656 --> 01:43:26,325
That's it. There.

1278
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:29,495
It's all right, darling.

1279
01:44:40,149 --> 01:44:41,358
Dad.

1280
01:44:42,359 --> 01:44:43,569
I'm okay.

1281
01:44:47,156 --> 01:44:48,574
You don't need to look for me.

1282
01:44:50,117 --> 01:44:51,660
I'll come back when I'm ready.

1283
01:44:54,163 --> 01:44:55,664
I wanna keep walking...

1284
01:44:57,166 --> 01:44:59,083
until I can't see the sea.

1285
01:45:01,003 --> 01:45:02,713
We found Dr. Kelson.

1286
01:45:03,964 --> 01:45:05,508
He's not insane.

1287
01:45:06,509 --> 01:45:07,885
He's a kind man.

1288
01:45:15,309 --> 01:45:16,768
A baby?

1289
01:45:16,769 --> 01:45:18,144
Come on!
Yeah.

1290
01:45:26,820 --> 01:45:28,656
The baby's from an infected...

1291
01:45:30,241 --> 01:45:31,408
but she's not.

1292
01:45:32,326 --> 01:45:33,744
She's okay.

1293
01:45:37,081 --> 01:45:39,166
She was left
just outside the gates.

1294
01:45:44,588 --> 01:45:46,090
Please be kind to her.

1295
01:45:48,592 --> 01:45:49,843
Her name is Isla.

1296
01:46:09,154 --> 01:46:11,031
No!

1297
01:46:11,365 --> 01:46:13,199
Spike!

1298
01:46:19,123 --> 01:46:21,458
Spike!

1299
01:47:21,769 --> 01:47:22,811
Fuck.

1300
01:47:32,821 --> 01:47:34,031
Oh!

1301
01:47:37,368 --> 01:47:39,036
Wonderful shot.

1302
01:47:41,997 --> 01:47:43,540
It was real poetry.

1303
01:47:46,085 --> 01:47:50,588
Though, I think there's
a few too many coming now.

1304
01:47:51,924 --> 01:47:55,468
Even for a fine young warrior
like yourself.

1305
01:47:55,469 --> 01:47:57,221
Would you mind
if we stepped in?

1306
01:47:59,223 --> 01:48:00,849
It would be our pleasure.

1307
01:48:05,562 --> 01:48:06,772
All right.

1308
01:48:07,815 --> 01:48:08,815
Hold.

1309
01:48:10,192 --> 01:48:11,275
Hold.

1310
01:48:13,362 --> 01:48:14,821
Fucking go.

1311
01:49:07,541 --> 01:49:08,583
Howzat?

1312
01:49:08,584 --> 01:49:10,293
Howzat!

1313
01:49:13,213 --> 01:49:14,214
Hello.

1314
01:49:16,258 --> 01:49:17,634
My name's Jimmy.

1315
01:49:31,774 --> 01:49:33,733
Let's be pals.
