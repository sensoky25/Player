12:49.880 --> 12:51.740
about the Gu family's existence.

16:28.240 --> 16:29.240
Please spare me!

16:29.600 --> 16:30.660
I'll kowtow to you!

16:31.240 --> 16:32.440
You just reminded me.

16:33.440 --> 16:34.760
Remember to notify his family.

16:34.760 --> 16:35.320
Got it.

16:42.880 --> 16:43.560
You

16:44.080 --> 16:45.210
forced me into this!

16:51.240 --> 16:52.800
From all this information,

16:53.720 --> 16:55.320
it does look like

16:55.960 --> 16:57.820
Gu Jingyuan is the prime suspect.

17:08.119 --> 17:08.520
Don't move!

17:08.520 --> 17:09.650
If it really was him,

17:10.440 --> 17:12.640
he must have gone after your parents

17:13.119 --> 17:14.650
just to inherit Gu's Group.

17:15.240 --> 17:15.970
Gu Jingyuan,

17:16.440 --> 17:17.970
who doesn't have ambition?

17:18.640 --> 17:20.040
You even killed Gu Hai

17:20.560 --> 17:22.220
for the right of inheritance!

17:23.359 --> 17:24.640
You're nothing but a dog

17:24.640 --> 17:25.880
raised by Chairman Gu!

17:25.880 --> 17:26.440
Shut up!

17:30.920 --> 17:31.480
What?

17:31.880 --> 17:32.810
You feel guilty?

17:33.320 --> 17:34.280
You're scared?

17:35.080 --> 17:36.480
If Chairman Gu finds out,

17:36.520 --> 17:37.760
he won't let you off!

17:40.000 --> 17:41.040
Not everyone deserves

17:41.040 --> 17:43.040
to have ambition or selfish desire.

17:43.720 --> 17:45.520
You said I killed my brother.

17:48.040 --> 17:49.370
Who would believe that?

17:58.320 --> 17:59.600
And who would know

18:00.760 --> 18:02.880
whether the one kept by his side

18:04.720 --> 18:06.200
is a dog or a wolf?

18:10.800 --> 18:11.400
Miao,

18:11.840 --> 18:13.370
I need to go back to Xijiang.

18:14.120 --> 18:16.080
I need to go back and find out the truth.

18:16.080 --> 18:17.760
No, it's too dangerous.

18:18.320 --> 18:19.450
But I have to go back.

18:20.160 --> 18:21.080
I can't let my parents

18:21.080 --> 18:22.480
die without knowing why.

18:22.920 --> 18:23.560
But even if you go back,

18:23.560 --> 18:25.360
what evidence can you even find?

18:29.320 --> 18:30.980
If I can find that house model,

18:31.480 --> 18:32.400
the truth

18:32.800 --> 18:33.840
will come to light.

18:59.760 --> 19:00.890
Hello, Chairman Gu.

[Gu's Group Annual Appreciation Ceremony]

19:27.880 --> 19:28.640
Everyone,

19:29.600 --> 19:30.880
long time no see.

19:31.520 --> 19:32.200
Now,

19:32.440 --> 19:34.370
allow me to officially introduce—

19:34.600 --> 19:35.360
this is

19:35.800 --> 19:37.360
my long-lost

19:37.680 --> 19:38.800
biological granddaughter,

19:38.800 --> 19:39.400
Yan.

19:42.480 --> 19:43.280
Come, Yan.

19:43.400 --> 19:44.130
Come up here.

19:48.400 --> 19:49.360
So elegant.

19:49.760 --> 19:50.720
She's so pretty.

19:51.160 --> 19:52.480
She is young,

19:52.920 --> 19:53.720
but she will be

19:54.240 --> 19:57.280
the future heir of Gu's Group.

19:58.240 --> 19:59.100
I hope all of you

19:59.440 --> 20:01.800
will give her your support

20:02.280 --> 20:03.940
and look after her from now on.

20:28.720 --> 20:30.050
My dear granddaughter,

20:30.280 --> 20:31.360
we're home.

20:35.240 --> 20:35.840
Remember,

20:36.040 --> 20:36.600

20:36.760 --> 20:37.800
is your home.

20:40.200 --> 20:40.480
Yes.

20:40.560 --> 20:41.480
It's quite cold.

20:41.480 --> 20:42.880
Help Dad go inside first.

20:43.240 --> 20:43.600
Okay.

20:43.760 --> 20:44.280
Dad.

20:44.880 --> 20:46.140
I'll take the luggage.

20:46.240 --> 20:46.600
Okay.

20:46.720 --> 20:47.120
Okay.

20:47.640 --> 20:48.240
Mr. Gu,

20:48.560 --> 20:49.520

20:49.520 --> 20:50.200
Okay. Okay.

21:05.400 --> 21:06.120
Uncle,

21:08.040 --> 21:09.700
have we met somewhere before?

21:16.640 --> 21:17.560
Gu Jingyuan,

21:18.240 --> 21:20.200
was it you who killed my parents?

21:21.000 --> 21:22.480
I will find out the truth.

21:34.920 --> 21:35.760
Uncle?

21:44.200 --> 21:44.880
Have we?

21:50.960 --> 21:52.560
Maybe you've forgotten me.

21:52.960 --> 21:53.680
Qiao Yan,

21:55.440 --> 21:56.160
I really regret

21:56.160 --> 21:58.000
not bringing you back earlier.

21:59.840 --> 22:00.960
Otherwise, your parents

22:00.960 --> 22:01.960
wouldn't have...

22:32.560 --> 22:34.490
It's quite cold at night in Xijiang

22:35.320 --> 22:36.480
when it's windy.

22:38.600 --> 22:40.260
If you plan to stay here often,

22:42.040 --> 22:43.640
you'll need to get used to it.

22:48.080 --> 22:48.840
Of course.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.080
This is my home.

22:53.240 --> 22:55.040
I'll definitely settle in well.

22:56.320 --> 22:58.250
Thank you for your concern, Uncle.

23:32.720 --> 23:33.520
Miss Qiao Yan,

23:33.760 --> 23:34.880
your room is ready.

Chairman Gu is waiting for you
in the study.

23:53.960 --> 23:55.120
We moved into this old house

23:55.120 --> 23:57.040
when your father was born.

23:57.560 --> 23:58.640
Mr. Gu is nostalgic.

23:58.640 --> 24:00.240
He's lived here all the time.

24:01.680 --> 24:02.560
Oh, this room

24:03.000 --> 24:04.200
belongs to Jingyuan.

24:04.440 --> 24:05.880
He likes peace and quiet

24:06.320 --> 24:07.600
and doesn't like to be disturbed.

24:07.600 --> 24:09.360
Make sure you don't enter by mistake.

24:09.360 --> 24:09.760
Come,

24:10.240 --> 24:11.500
your room is over here.

24:24.560 --> 24:25.040
Dad,

24:25.160 --> 24:26.290
you wanted to see me?

24:26.520 --> 24:27.320
Jingyuan,

24:27.880 --> 24:29.280
come, have a seat.

24:44.000 --> 24:44.720
What?

24:45.200 --> 24:46.240
You're unhappy?

24:47.800 --> 24:48.640
Of course not.

24:49.000 --> 24:49.960
I'm happy for you

24:50.120 --> 24:51.650
that Qiao Yan has come back.

24:55.320 --> 24:57.320
Your brother died in a car accident.

24:58.840 --> 25:01.280
Yan is my biological granddaughter

25:02.960 --> 25:05.920
and the only blood relative
I have left in this world.

25:07.080 --> 25:08.120
Over the years,

25:08.880 --> 25:10.440
I've owed her far too much.

25:11.720 --> 25:13.840
I must make it up to her double.

25:25.720 --> 25:26.360
Dad,

25:27.680 --> 25:29.120
what am I

25:32.120 --> 25:32.920
to you?

26:08.920 --> 26:10.600
Yan's uncle

26:12.040 --> 26:15.100
and my adopted son
who has been by my side for many years.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.100
Since Yan is willing to come back,

26:18.480 --> 26:20.440
you should get along well with her.

26:21.480 --> 26:23.080
When I'm gone,

26:24.040 --> 26:25.720
you must take good care of her

26:26.240 --> 26:28.970
and help her
safeguard the Gu family's business.

26:29.600 --> 26:30.530
That is your duty

26:31.480 --> 26:33.520
as my closest

26:34.480 --> 26:35.880
adopted son.

26:36.920 --> 26:37.980
Do you understand?

26:43.400 --> 26:44.080
Yes.

26:46.520 --> 26:47.920
If there's nothing else,

26:49.520 --> 26:50.520
I'm going back.

26:53.440 --> 26:54.280
Yuan,

26:56.720 --> 26:57.680
don't

26:58.680 --> 27:00.120
let me down.

27:56.400 --> 27:57.200
Yuan,

27:58.840 --> 28:00.960
Yan is my biological granddaughter

28:01.680 --> 28:04.610
and the only blood relative
I have left in this world.

28:05.360 --> 28:07.040
You must take good care of her

28:07.360 --> 28:10.090
and help her
safeguard the Gu family's business.

28:11.040 --> 28:11.640
Oh my!

28:33.800 --> 28:34.400
Come out.

28:49.360 --> 28:50.960
What are you doing in my room?

28:55.080 --> 28:56.440
This house is too big.

28:58.240 --> 28:59.120
I got lost.

29:00.000 --> 29:00.640
Just now,

29:00.880 --> 29:02.920
Uncle Xu specially showed me around.

29:02.920 --> 29:03.560
But

29:04.080 --> 29:05.400
I didn't remember the way.

29:05.400 --> 29:06.800
So I ended up in the wrong room.

29:06.800 --> 29:08.240
When you walk into the wrong room,

29:08.240 --> 29:10.320
your first reaction should be to leave,

29:10.320 --> 29:11.720
not to stay.

29:13.040 --> 29:13.840
You're right.

29:14.800 --> 29:15.800
Just now,

29:16.200 --> 29:17.800
I was about to leave,

29:18.560 --> 29:19.920
but you suddenly came back.

29:19.920 --> 29:20.280
I...

29:23.560 --> 29:24.720
The way you looked

29:25.600 --> 29:26.400
scared me,

29:27.320 --> 29:28.280
so I hid.

29:28.440 --> 29:29.500
What way did I look?

29:31.600 --> 29:33.260
You're very happy today, huh?

29:34.080 --> 29:36.160
You think you made a fool of me, huh?

29:37.560 --> 29:38.200
Qiao Yan,

29:39.080 --> 29:40.080
why exactly

29:41.320 --> 29:42.720
did you come back to the Gu family?
