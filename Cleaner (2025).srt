1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000


2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000


3
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,254
Get in the house.
Get in the house.

4
00:01:21,255 --> 00:01:22,603
Hey, hey, hey.

5
00:01:22,604 --> 00:01:25,954
How many bloody
times do we have to do this?

6
00:01:25,955 --> 00:01:28,043
It's not my fault.
It's his fault.

7
00:01:28,044 --> 00:01:30,567
- I'll take care of him.
- Michael, can you hear me?

8
00:01:30,568 --> 00:01:31,829
It's fine.
It's fine.

9
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,266
Why are
you protecting him?

10
00:01:33,267 --> 00:01:36,573
I thought you'd grown up by now.
Can you hear me?

11
00:01:36,574 --> 00:01:38,227
Don't you touch him!

12
00:01:38,228 --> 00:01:39,924
MAN [Shouting]: Why
don't you listen to me, Michael?

13
00:01:39,925 --> 00:01:41,622
I can do what I like.
He's my son.

14
00:01:41,623 --> 00:01:42,797
Leave him alone!

15
00:01:44,365 --> 00:01:45,800
Listen!
Freak.

16
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:48,977
I'm the only one who can freak
him, ain't I, Michael?

17
00:01:48,978 --> 00:01:50,239
Why ain't you listening to me?

18
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,023
You're not gonna do
that... not that...

19
00:01:52,024 --> 00:01:52,894
Why aren't you
listening to me?

20
00:01:52,895 --> 00:01:54,374
Stop!

21
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:56,637
You're not gonna
embarrass me anymore.

22
00:01:56,638 --> 00:01:59,727
You bully! Get
out! Get out! Get out! Get out!

00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:40,349

Hello?

35
00:04:13,818 --> 00:04:16,820
Right now? I'm late for work.
Can I come in later?

36
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,824
Okay.

37
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,088
Okay. I'll be there.

38
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:24,568
Shit.

39
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:35,186
I can't believe I'm
hearing this. Are you serious?

40
00:04:35,187 --> 00:04:36,536
Is she serious?

41
00:04:36,537 --> 00:04:39,408
This is a joke,
an absolute joke.

42
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:41,541
I think the key issue
here is accountability.

43
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:43,412
- Accountability?
- Your brother

44
00:04:43,413 --> 00:04:45,806
is in clear breach
of our code of conduct.

45
00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:47,286
We have no choice but
to terminate

46
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,635
his placement
here immediately.

47
00:04:49,593 --> 00:04:50,898
That's good. That's really good.

48
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:52,682
I appreciate
that you're upset.

49
00:04:52,683 --> 00:04:54,293
Excuse me?

50
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,208
- Do you need to get that?
- No.

51
00:04:56,818 --> 00:04:58,949
- Let's just calm down.
- Calm down?

52
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,387
- Don't tell her to calm down.
- I am wary of his triggers.

53
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:02,953
I'm purely looking out
for Michael.

54
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:04,303
No, you're not.

55
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,435
This is, what, the seventh,

56
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:08,524
no, eighth placement
to have fallen through.

57
00:05:08,525 --> 00:05:10,613
Ninth. It's the ninth placement.

58
00:05:10,614 --> 00:05:12,093
Right. See? Ninth.

59
00:05:12,094 --> 00:05:15,096
There was Rose House,
Clinton House, Thomas Lodge.

60
00:05:15,097 --> 00:05:16,967
- Yes, ninth.
- Inckenfield Lane.

61
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:20,275
Rose House again, counts as
twice. Ford Lands, Goldsmiths...

62
00:05:20,276 --> 00:05:23,017
- Yes. Thanks, Michael.
- Lantern and here.

63
00:05:23,018 --> 00:05:25,628
- That makes nine.
- Thank you.

64
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:26,674
You're welcome.

65
00:05:27,588 --> 00:05:30,633
Someone stole confidential
care home account information

66
00:05:30,634 --> 00:05:32,679
and leaked it
to the local press.

67
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,942
Someone. You don't know that
was Michael. Where's the proof?

68
00:05:34,943 --> 00:05:36,465
It's not the first
time your brother

69
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:38,075
has bypassed our
online security.

70
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:39,729
It could have been anyone.

71
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,470
And, actually, if you
hadn't been stealing from people

72
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:43,167
you're supposed
to be looking after,

73
00:05:43,168 --> 00:05:45,474
maybe there'd be
nothing for anyone to leak.

74
00:05:45,475 --> 00:05:47,520
Technically,
it is a criminal matter.

75
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:49,826
Your brother's lucky we're not
pressing charges for data theft.

76
00:05:49,827 --> 00:05:53,047
Theft? You stole money from him
and now you're kicking him out.

77
00:05:53,048 --> 00:05:54,701
Well, it sounds like Michael

78
00:05:54,702 --> 00:05:56,267
would be better off
living with you.

79
00:05:56,268 --> 00:05:57,487
A hundred percent.

80
00:05:57,966 --> 00:05:59,488
I'm sorry. We have no choice.

81
00:05:59,489 --> 00:06:01,795
His placement here
is no longer tenable.

82
00:06:01,796 --> 00:06:03,101
Michael needs to leave.

83
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:05,494
Today. Now.

84
00:06:05,495 --> 00:06:07,061
Great.

85
00:06:07,062 --> 00:06:09,368
I have work. I don't even
have time to get your things.

86
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,066
We'll forward them on.

87
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,158
Fuck.

88
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:25,036
You'll be
hearing from my lawyer.

89
00:06:25,863 --> 00:06:29,126
- Like you have a lawyer.
- She doesn't know that.

90
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,436
Derek, I was just about to call.

91
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:37,396
Late and full of shit.
We've spoken about this, Joey.

92
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,136
Technically,
I'm not that late.

93
00:06:39,137 --> 00:06:40,616
Technically, you're sacked.

94
00:06:40,617 --> 00:06:43,010
No, no, no, no. Look, Derek,
it was a family emergency.

95
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:46,274
Please, I cannot lose this job.
I swear I'll be there by...

96
00:06:46,275 --> 00:06:49,496
Two. Get here by two.

97
00:06:59,549 --> 00:07:01,681
So, how was your day?

98
00:07:01,682 --> 00:07:03,030
Well, first my boss
was being a...

99
00:07:03,031 --> 00:07:04,205
Please don't swear.

100
00:07:04,206 --> 00:07:05,336
Bad word. Cos I was late.

101
00:07:05,337 --> 00:07:06,686
Then I got a call
to come and get you.

102
00:07:06,687 --> 00:07:08,252
And cos my boss is a bad word,

103
00:07:08,253 --> 00:07:10,124
if I'm not in by two,
the bad word will sack me.

104
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,473
Apart from that, great. You?

105
00:07:11,474 --> 00:07:13,388
Yeah, I'm happy.
I get to be with my sister.

106
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:15,521
Oh, please don't swear.

107
00:07:15,522 --> 00:07:17,392
For fuck...

108
00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:30,579
You wouldn't know who hacked the
care home account to leak them?

109
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,929
- Are you cross? You seem cross.
- Yeah, I am.

110
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,409
With the care home,
and those wankers

111
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,629
- for stealing your allowance.
- Joanna.

112
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,761
- They have to face justice.
- They do.

113
00:07:38,762 --> 00:07:41,677
Just not sure they will.
It's not how the world works.

114
00:07:41,678 --> 00:07:44,027
That's why I wanna be
a crusader for the truth.

115
00:07:44,028 --> 00:07:45,899
Like Piers Morgan.

116
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,944
Piers Morgan is an
attention-seeking

117
00:07:47,945 --> 00:07:49,730
the worst word.

118
00:07:50,818 --> 00:07:54,212
Well, Piers Morgan wouldn't
have got on the wrong bus.

119
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:57,738
Fuck!

120
00:08:02,612 --> 00:08:04,831
No more swearing.

121
00:08:04,832 --> 00:08:06,093
I said I'm sorry.

122
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,883
Motherf...

123
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,760
Stop. Stop! Stop, stop, stop!

124
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:23,284
- My charger. I left my charger.
- We'll get one later.

125
00:08:23,285 --> 00:08:25,025
- You don't understand.
- Michael...

126
00:08:25,026 --> 00:08:28,943
I'm at seven fucking percent!
Where is my fucking charger?

127
00:08:30,684 --> 00:08:32,554
- No! No!
- Michael. Michael.

128
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:34,295
- You...
- Michael.

129
00:08:34,296 --> 00:08:35,557
- You don't... You...
- Michael.

130
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:36,951
Do you need a squeeze?

131
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,087
- I'm so sorry.
- I know.

132
00:08:44,088 --> 00:08:46,787
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry too.

133
00:09:00,104 --> 00:09:01,757
When are we going home?

134
00:09:01,758 --> 00:09:03,846
You'll have to hang
here till I finish at six.

135
00:09:03,847 --> 00:09:05,718
Six? That's two Lord
of the Rings.

136
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:07,634
Or one extended edition.

137
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,942
I've got five minutes.
Come on.

138
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,537
Big Ron will keep an eye on you.
He'll make sure you're okay.

139
00:09:42,538 --> 00:09:44,539
How's it going, Michael?

140
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,236
Does he know I'm autistic?

141
00:09:46,237 --> 00:09:48,325
He knows. He's cool.
It'll be fine.

142
00:09:48,326 --> 00:09:49,675
Does he have a charger?

143
00:09:49,676 --> 00:09:51,503
I can sort that
out for you, mate.

144
00:09:53,723 --> 00:09:56,072
And he'll look after your bag.

145
00:09:56,073 --> 00:09:57,597
I'll be back in a minute.

146
00:09:58,728 --> 00:10:00,990
There's a lot of people.
It's busy.

147
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:02,122
There's a party tonight.

148
00:10:02,123 --> 00:10:03,732
We're not invited and
you hate parties.

149
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:05,821
Can't I just come with you?

150
00:10:05,822 --> 00:10:07,954
You could get me a job here.

151
00:10:07,955 --> 00:10:09,956
You don't wanna work here.
My bosses are dicks.

152
00:10:09,957 --> 00:10:11,740
- Well, you do.
- Outside the building.

153
00:10:11,741 --> 00:10:14,395
Away from the dicks.
I'll be back.

154
00:10:14,396 --> 00:10:17,094
And home...
Am I staying with you?

155
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:20,836
- Until we find a new placement.
- I don't like the placements.

156
00:10:20,837 --> 00:10:23,012
We'll talk about this later.
I have to go.

157
00:10:23,013 --> 00:10:26,234
- It's always later.
- You're staying tonight.

158
00:10:27,017 --> 00:10:28,191
For how long?

159
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:30,630
I need to go.
Stay with Big Ron.

160
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:41,075
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

161
00:10:50,258 --> 00:10:51,824
The gala is all set.

162
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:54,217
18:00 hours,
guests arrive, cocktails begin.

163
00:10:54,218 --> 00:10:57,046
18:20, Geoffrey to give
brief shareholder speech.

164
00:10:57,047 --> 00:10:58,265
I've allowed 30 minutes.

165
00:10:58,266 --> 00:11:01,399
18:21, my will to live expires.

166
00:11:01,878 --> 00:11:03,139
Oh, and just to flag,

167
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,838
there will be live performers
before and after.

168
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,275
It's gonna be all Cirque du
Soleilcrap, isn't it?

169
00:11:08,276 --> 00:11:09,929
Just make sure they
give us a wide berth.

170
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,105
I want a fucking
ten-metre exclusion zone.

171
00:11:12,106 --> 00:11:15,195
- The theme's divine renewal.
- I really don't give a shit.

172
00:11:15,196 --> 00:11:17,458
Are you dipping, Gerald?

173
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:20,549
Yes. I think
I'm fucking dipping.

174
00:11:32,822 --> 00:11:35,695
Jesus Christ. Breathe in.

175
00:11:38,872 --> 00:11:42,135
You'd better not fucking
drop now. You should be at home.

176
00:11:42,136 --> 00:11:44,485
Maybe if you paid proper
maternity leave, she would be.

177
00:11:56,411 --> 00:11:57,933
Halina...

178
00:11:57,934 --> 00:12:02,111
I swear, I wish you would have
dropped right on his shoes.

179
00:12:02,112 --> 00:12:03,417
Yeah, me too.

180
00:12:03,418 --> 00:12:04,853
I already got the mop.

181
00:12:04,854 --> 00:12:07,291
For sure he would have
made you clean it.

182
00:12:08,902 --> 00:12:10,206
Alright, bye.

183
00:12:10,207 --> 00:12:11,339
Bye.

184
00:12:24,178 --> 00:12:26,309
17 seconds. I made it.

185
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:30,749
We really need to have a chat
about your attitude, Joey.

186
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,228
It's no wonder
the army kicked you out.

187
00:12:32,229 --> 00:12:35,057
Love to. Got to get to work.

188
00:12:35,058 --> 00:12:37,668
My boss can be a real
pain in the arse.

189
00:12:37,669 --> 00:12:39,975
Your boss would love you to.

190
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:41,803
You still owe me an hour,
at least.

191
00:12:41,804 --> 00:12:43,413
- What?
- I'll add it on.

192
00:12:43,414 --> 00:12:46,069
You can start with a...

193
00:12:48,071 --> 00:12:49,072
bird strike.

194
00:12:49,507 --> 00:12:53,511
- Come on.
- Level 51, panel F 51 P 118.

195
00:12:54,034 --> 00:12:56,079
Should be
properly baked on by now.

196
00:12:56,645 --> 00:13:00,780
- That's borderline harassment.
- Enjoy. Enjoy. Enjoy.

197
00:14:15,158 --> 00:14:16,290
Ooh!

198
00:14:16,768 --> 00:14:19,161
- Missed a bit.
- Definitely not funny.

199
00:14:19,162 --> 00:14:21,555
See, I thought you weren't
even coming in today, slacker.

200
00:14:21,556 --> 00:14:24,427
- Some of us are almost done.
- I had to sort something.

201
00:14:24,428 --> 00:14:26,255
Oh, yeah?

202
00:14:26,256 --> 00:14:27,778
They kicked Michael
out of his care home.

203
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:29,346
- Oh, man. What?
- Yeah.

204
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:32,348
He hacked their records, accused
them of stealing his money.

205
00:14:32,349 --> 00:14:34,785
- So, yeah, it's a shitshow.
- Fuck.

206
00:14:34,786 --> 00:14:36,787
That's my El Capitan
climb screwed.

207
00:14:36,788 --> 00:14:39,138
Shit, I'm so sorry,
man. How's he doing?

208
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:41,488
- He's alright.
- Oh, yeah?

209
00:14:41,489 --> 00:14:44,404
- He's downstairs.
- You brought him here?

210
00:14:44,405 --> 00:14:48,322
It was that or get fired.
It's cool. He's with Big Ron.

211
00:14:51,151 --> 00:14:53,283
Alright, Michael? Have that.

212
00:14:55,024 --> 00:14:56,983
Is my phone charged?

213
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,942
Hold on.

214
00:15:02,814 --> 00:15:03,771
Oi!

215
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:18,307
- JENNIFER [On phone]: Gerald?
- That cleaner in the lift.

216
00:15:18,308 --> 00:15:19,613
There were two
cleaners in the lift.

217
00:15:19,614 --> 00:15:20,701
The non-pregnant one.

218
00:15:20,702 --> 00:15:22,094
The lippy one.
The window cleaner.

219
00:15:22,095 --> 00:15:23,486
We can't sack her
for being lippy

220
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:24,923
if that's what
you're about to ask.

221
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,143
- I'll call her line manager.
- Do it.

222
00:15:28,014 --> 00:15:29,363
Nice of you to join us.

223
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:32,582
- Bloody hate these things.
- Yes.

224
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,497
Well, if you could possibly find
it within yourself

225
00:15:34,498 --> 00:15:35,629
to soldier through.

226
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:38,067
- Fine.
- And smile.

227
00:15:39,764 --> 00:15:41,635
Good to see you.

228
00:15:41,636 --> 00:15:43,202
Gerald. You're looking well.

229
00:15:43,203 --> 00:15:46,205
- Am I? Shall we do this?
- Yes.

230
00:15:46,206 --> 00:15:49,034
Right, I'll tee up,
you play off.

231
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:51,688
Nothing too taxing, I promise.

232
00:15:51,689 --> 00:15:54,170
- Great.
- Absolutely.

233
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:02,047
With me are
Geoffrey and Gerald Milton,

234
00:16:02,048 --> 00:16:05,572
owners and CEOs
of Agnian Energy.

235
00:16:05,573 --> 00:16:06,877
Thank you for joining me.

236
00:16:06,878 --> 00:16:08,575
- Pleasure.
- Absolutely.

237
00:16:08,576 --> 00:16:10,098
Demand has never been higher,

238
00:16:10,099 --> 00:16:12,187
but there is
a great deal of uncertainty

239
00:16:12,188 --> 00:16:14,059
in the energy markets right now.

240
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,756
Agnian is riding high.

241
00:16:15,757 --> 00:16:19,107
You have your shareholder
gala this evening to celebrate.

242
00:16:19,108 --> 00:16:21,022
What is Agnian doing right?

243
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:23,546
Here at Agnian, we see
meeting the world's energy needs

244
00:16:23,547 --> 00:16:25,461
as a privilege and a duty.

245
00:16:25,462 --> 00:16:26,897
Absolutely.

246
00:16:26,898 --> 00:16:28,987
Billions of people
depend on energy,

247
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,467
but it has to be provided
sustainably and responsibly.

248
00:16:31,468 --> 00:16:32,816
Absolutely.

249
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:34,731
My brother and I
and everyone here at Agnian

250
00:16:34,732 --> 00:16:38,257
are passionate about cleaner
strategies for a cleaner future.

251
00:16:38,258 --> 00:16:39,302
Absolutely.

252
00:17:06,764 --> 00:17:07,852
Want some?

253
00:17:08,897 --> 00:17:10,725
Ooh!

254
00:17:11,204 --> 00:17:13,683
- Nice.
- Oh, shit.

255
00:17:13,684 --> 00:17:16,382
There's a bird strike on 51.
Derek wants you to clean it.

256
00:17:16,383 --> 00:17:19,037
Right. And he just
forgot to tell me.

257
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,386
- Okay.
- He did.

258
00:17:20,387 --> 00:17:21,996
- Sure.
- So I'm telling you now.

259
00:17:21,997 --> 00:17:23,476
- Stop it.
- 51.

260
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:25,739
Stop it.
You're embarrassing yourself.

261
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:29,309
- Who got you this job?
- Not so I could do yours.

262
00:17:30,136 --> 00:17:32,399
Fuck it. I'll get to it later.

263
00:17:33,313 --> 00:17:36,054
GEOFFREY [On video]: Agnian
believes in reducing emissions,

264
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,664
not output.

265
00:17:37,665 --> 00:17:40,842
We believe in action,
not pledges.

266
00:17:41,495 --> 00:17:45,237
Our commitment to renewable
energy is not just a promise,

267
00:17:45,238 --> 00:17:46,803
it's a path we walk every day.

268
00:17:46,804 --> 00:17:48,501
So what do you think?

269
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:51,983
I'm thinking, 'Jesus Christ.
How much did that cost?'

270
00:17:53,855 --> 00:17:55,682
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

271
00:17:55,683 --> 00:17:57,466
You're very kind,
but you haven't heard...

272
00:17:59,774 --> 00:18:01,080
I'll get that fixed.

273
00:18:02,168 --> 00:18:03,733
No, well,
don't feel you have to.

274
00:18:03,734 --> 00:18:05,692
And we want you to join us

275
00:18:05,693 --> 00:18:09,958
in our shared journey towards
a brighter, cleaner future.

276
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,278
Now who's slacking?

277
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,715
You gotta enjoy
these moments, Joey.

278
00:18:28,716 --> 00:18:31,327
Human life is a fleeting thing.

279
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:35,070
- All flesh is grass.
- Thanks, Buddha.

280
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,466
Look at us,
just like fuckin' ants, just...

281
00:18:40,467 --> 00:18:42,424
Hey, do you ever wonder what
it was like before we were here?

282
00:18:42,425 --> 00:18:43,338
Are you high?

283
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:44,774
- Hey, Noah.
- Hey, Derek.

284
00:18:44,775 --> 00:18:46,733
You need to finish up.
The gala starts in an hour.

285
00:18:46,734 --> 00:18:48,082
Okay. Wow.

286
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,692
- We have to clear the building.
- No, listen,

287
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:51,520
I don't know how you
make it through the day, mate.

288
00:18:51,521 --> 00:18:53,653
You're an inspiration
to all of us, D, genuinely.

289
00:18:53,654 --> 00:18:54,915
Yeah, I've been told
to wrap it up.

290
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,569
- Yeah, okay.
- You need to finish up.

291
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,874
Derek says turn
your earpiece on.

292
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,441
He knows it's not broken.

293
00:18:59,442 --> 00:19:02,140
- He's smart like that.
- Hi, Derek.

294
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,098
You pissed off
a Milton in the lift.

295
00:19:04,099 --> 00:19:05,317
He was being a dick.

296
00:19:05,318 --> 00:19:06,579
When you own the building,

297
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,233
you get to be a dick.

298
00:19:08,234 --> 00:19:10,236
- What's your excuse, D?
- Clean the fucking bird.

299
00:19:11,237 --> 00:19:14,282
Right, I'm done.
Have a good one, yeah?

300
00:19:14,283 --> 00:19:17,067
Listen, I hope it's all
okay with Michael, seriously.

301
00:19:17,068 --> 00:19:20,462
Look after him, yeah? I mean,
I know you know that, but...

302
00:19:20,463 --> 00:19:23,204
Maybe take him somewhere
nice after you knock off.

303
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:25,685
- Will do, Dad.
- Later, Joey.

304
00:19:25,686 --> 00:19:26,904
Right.

305
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,474
♪ I'm taking control

306
00:19:31,996 --> 00:19:34,998

308
00:19:38,264 --> 00:19:40,090
Let's make sure it's a good one.

309
00:19:40,091 --> 00:19:42,529
Clear as you go,

310
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:46,358
♪ Just give me
a beat and melody...

311
00:19:54,454 --> 00:19:56,369
It's our values.

312
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:59,415
Agnian Values.

313
00:20:01,852 --> 00:20:03,289
Sustainability.

314
00:20:04,681 --> 00:20:05,769

315
00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:08,815

00:20:08,816 --> 00:20:12,862

- You can't be up here, Michael.

320
00:20:42,676 --> 00:20:44,894
You'll get me sacked.
Go down. I'll be two minutes.

321
00:20:44,895 --> 00:20:47,680
- I want to go home.
- Get in the lift and go down.

322
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:50,509
- You can't tell me what to do.
- Yes, I can. Go down.

323
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,337
- Fuck off!
- I don't need this shit.

324
00:20:52,338 --> 00:20:55,165
- Fuck you, Joanna!
- No! Fuck you!

325
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,037
Go on, then!

326
00:20:57,038 --> 00:20:58,560
Where are you going? Come back!

327
00:20:58,561 --> 00:21:03,261
- Away from you, like you want!
- Fuck!

328
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:07,439
Shit.

329
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,354
DEREK [In earpiece]:
Have you cleaned that bird yet?

330
00:21:09,355 --> 00:21:12,270
- It's done. I'm coming up.
- Nah ah ah ah.

331
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,882
Nice try. Get in.
I'll take you there.

332
00:21:15,883 --> 00:21:17,666
Or you're not clocking off.

333
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:19,015
Derek, I've got
something I have...

334
00:21:19,016 --> 00:21:20,016
Bullshit.

335
00:21:20,017 --> 00:21:21,148
Get on with it.

336
00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:22,192
Fuck.

337
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:27,155
Fuck!

338
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,616
Prick.

339
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:58,578
Prick
with his finger on the override.

340
00:22:11,112 --> 00:22:14,027
But it's our values,
it's Agnian values...

341
00:22:14,028 --> 00:22:16,551
- Geoffrey.
- Erica.

342
00:22:16,552 --> 00:22:19,120
So my video's
going down a storm.

343
00:22:19,468 --> 00:22:20,947
Oscar worthy.

344
00:22:20,948 --> 00:22:22,601
I want much more than that.

345
00:22:22,602 --> 00:22:23,993
Really?

346
00:22:23,994 --> 00:22:26,693
Say, VP of brand strategy?

347
00:22:27,955 --> 00:22:29,521
No doubt you're to blame
for inflicting the

348
00:22:29,522 --> 00:22:31,523
Shit de Soleil on us.

349
00:22:31,524 --> 00:22:34,527
'Du.' It's 'du Soleil',
Geoffrey.

350
00:22:35,005 --> 00:22:38,095
'Du' you think I care?

351
00:22:41,185 --> 00:22:42,838
Where the hell is Gerald?

352
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:46,015
Oh. Last seen
dry-humping Alison Pope.

353
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,540
Alison Pope? From Morgan?

354
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:51,107
And don't erupt, but the
performers are going to be late.

355
00:22:51,108 --> 00:22:54,329
Alison-fucking-Pope. Jesus.

356
00:22:59,073 --> 00:23:00,640
Fuck you, Derek.

357
00:23:15,611 --> 00:23:17,352
Fuck.

358
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,703
Are you okay?

359
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,488
What was that?

360
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:46,990
Okay, done. Get me up, Derek.

361
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,819
Derek? Derek!

362
00:23:50,516 --> 00:23:54,128
Just going for a slash.
Back in five.

363
00:23:54,868 --> 00:23:56,346
Maybe ten.

364
00:23:56,347 --> 00:23:58,219
Just get me up.

365
00:24:12,581 --> 00:24:14,148
Where the fuck have you been?

366
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,758
And don't say traffic.
We've all got GPS.

367
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:19,282
Geoffrey's about to go on,
so you'll have to wait.

368
00:24:19,283 --> 00:24:21,547
I'd get in there and show face.

369
00:24:47,703 --> 00:24:48,835
Cheers.

370
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:00,673
Excuse me.

371
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:15,209
Idiot.

372
00:25:20,954 --> 00:25:21,955
Good evening.

373
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:29,222
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
You're very kind.

374
00:25:29,223 --> 00:25:31,267
But you haven't heard
what I have to say yet.

375
00:25:32,487 --> 00:25:35,271
And we are not going to.
Come on.

376
00:25:35,272 --> 00:25:36,795
But what a year,

377
00:25:36,796 --> 00:25:39,537
and if I have to tell you just
how good it's been,

378
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,235
I suggest you
hire new accountants.

379
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:52,551
Come on, Derek, Jesus.

380
00:25:53,421 --> 00:25:55,030
You know what
your problem is, Joey?

381
00:25:55,031 --> 00:25:57,817
Is it the prick with
his finger on the override?

382
00:26:05,172 --> 00:26:06,913
It was a joke, Derek.

383
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,835
What are you doing?

384
00:26:17,184 --> 00:26:18,359
Derek!

385
00:26:22,711 --> 00:26:25,279
You did not have
to fucking kill them.

386
00:26:26,106 --> 00:26:27,586
Stick to the plan.

387
00:26:36,203 --> 00:26:38,379
Derek, stop dicking around.

388
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:49,216
And we are in.

389
00:26:50,043 --> 00:26:53,436
Because it's our values,
Agnian values...

390
00:26:53,437 --> 00:26:55,743
Yes, we do have them.

391
00:26:55,744 --> 00:26:59,834
Sustainability, transparency,
responsibility, trust,

392
00:26:59,835 --> 00:27:02,097
which drive our mission.

393
00:27:02,098 --> 00:27:03,708
Beautiful.

394
00:27:03,709 --> 00:27:05,885
Beautiful words, Geoffrey.

395
00:27:08,235 --> 00:27:09,889
Very inspiring.

396
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,068
If only a single
one of them was true.

397
00:28:46,594 --> 00:28:48,596
Four hours till
the fairy dust wears off.

398
00:28:49,336 --> 00:28:51,250
Bibbidy-bobbidy bye-bye!

399
00:28:58,475 --> 00:29:00,346
We are Earth Revolution,

400
00:29:00,347 --> 00:29:03,088
and our takeover tonight
will usher in a new dawn.

401
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:06,047
If you are good,
if you play nice,

402
00:29:06,048 --> 00:29:07,875
I promise you
will live to see it.

403
00:29:07,876 --> 00:29:09,964
Ooh, sounds so scary.

404
00:29:09,965 --> 00:29:12,184
Lifts and doors
locked up to your level.

405
00:29:12,185 --> 00:29:15,361
All calls and comms jammed.
No alarms raised.

406
00:29:15,362 --> 00:29:17,712
This is our house now.

407
00:29:26,721 --> 00:29:29,897
Greedy, Needy, Sleazy,

408
00:29:29,898 --> 00:29:34,946
Selfish,
Snorty, Deceitful, Cocky.

409
00:29:34,947 --> 00:29:37,601
We're one short. Where's Gropey?

410
00:29:38,646 --> 00:29:40,822
Geoffrey, where's Gerald?

411
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,869
Where's your brother, G?

412
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,440
I only ask once.

413
00:29:55,619 --> 00:29:57,359
GEOFFREY [Pained]:
527!

414
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,756
Apartment 527.

415
00:30:19,382 --> 00:30:20,644
There we go.

416
00:30:32,482 --> 00:30:34,833
Wakey, wakey, hands off snakey.

417
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:37,792
Hey, Gerry.

418
00:30:38,358 --> 00:30:39,575
Let's go.

419
00:30:41,361 --> 00:30:42,884
Ooh. Steady, now.

420
00:30:50,631 --> 00:30:54,808
Window cleaner. Window cleaner.

421
00:30:54,809 --> 00:30:56,289
What's that, Gerry?

422
00:30:56,985 --> 00:30:58,639
GERALD [Muffled]:
Window cleaner.

423
00:30:59,814 --> 00:31:03,122
And there was me thinking that
you never gave us a second look.

424
00:31:03,774 --> 00:31:06,168
What the fuck?

425
00:31:07,213 --> 00:31:09,650
Who owns
the building now, Gerry?

426
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:31,236
Help! Help! Hey!

427
00:31:31,237 --> 00:31:37,112
Look up! Hey! Hey...

428
00:31:40,768 --> 00:31:41,987
...up!

429
00:32:05,097 --> 00:32:06,054
Shit.

430
00:32:07,577 --> 00:32:10,232
Okay, Joey,
get a grip. Michael needs you.

431
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,669
Stay calm,
Michael. Joanna needs us.

432
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:16,150
Think, think, think.

433
00:32:16,151 --> 00:32:19,024
What would... what would
Piers Morgan do?

434
00:32:41,176 --> 00:32:43,918
Room service.
Where d'you want him?

435
00:32:46,921 --> 00:32:48,922
We're on the clock. Let's go.

436
00:32:48,923 --> 00:32:50,142
Make him decent.

437
00:32:53,754 --> 00:32:54,973
Noah.

438
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,714
Make him decent.

439
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,943
Marcus Blake. Cheers.

440
00:33:11,641 --> 00:33:12,816
Mmm!

441
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,168
Duval-Leroy. Very nice.

442
00:33:16,516 --> 00:33:20,910
Let's have no hysterics,
no heroics, no drama.

443
00:33:20,911 --> 00:33:22,303
You think this is the
first time people

444
00:33:22,304 --> 00:33:23,696
have tried to take
money from us?

445
00:33:23,697 --> 00:33:26,351
Let us go, and whatever you
were hoping to steal,

446
00:33:26,352 --> 00:33:27,787
we'll double it.

447
00:33:27,788 --> 00:33:29,572
He thinks we want their money.

448
00:33:30,138 --> 00:33:31,965
We don't want your money, Geoff.

449
00:33:35,535 --> 00:33:38,494
- What do you want?
- We wanna save the world.

450
00:33:39,104 --> 00:33:40,278
I don't understand.

451
00:33:42,716 --> 00:33:44,804
I love this
'Friends of the Earth' stuff.

452
00:33:44,805 --> 00:33:50,289
'Fuel your life the green way.'
Jesus Christ. Zee?

453
00:33:53,118 --> 00:33:55,554
GEOFFREY [On Video]: Agnian
believes in reducing emissions,

454
00:33:55,555 --> 00:33:57,077
not output.

455
00:33:57,078 --> 00:33:59,601
We believe in action,
not pledges.

456
00:33:59,602 --> 00:34:03,692
Our commitment to renewable
energy is not just a promise,

457
00:34:03,693 --> 00:34:06,130
it's a path we walk every day.

458
00:34:06,131 --> 00:34:07,827
And we want you to join us

459
00:34:07,828 --> 00:34:10,003
in our shared
journey towards a brighter...

460
00:34:10,004 --> 00:34:12,919
Doesn't look like
friendship to me, Geoffrey boy.

461
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,486
It doesn't, does it?

462
00:34:14,487 --> 00:34:17,619
I mean, do friends plunder,
choke and rape?

463
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:20,841
Noah, we can't do this
without them. Let him go.

464
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:25,324
I said let him go!

465
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:30,372
You'll have to forgive him.
He gets a little excited.

466
00:34:32,896 --> 00:34:36,290
Right, so this
is Laguna Taracoa.

467
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:38,901
You should know it
because Agnian has been dumping

468
00:34:38,902 --> 00:34:40,686
billions
of gallons of waste there,

469
00:34:40,687 --> 00:34:43,471
an entire ecosystem
completely destroyed.

470
00:34:43,472 --> 00:34:45,170
Ring any bells?

471
00:34:45,866 --> 00:34:49,043
No? How about now?

472
00:34:51,001 --> 00:34:53,916
Elena Lanza. She was with us
when we sabotaged

473
00:34:53,917 --> 00:34:55,962
the Taracoa
pipeline last year.

474
00:34:55,963 --> 00:34:58,051
She was caught
and was gonna use the trial

475
00:34:58,052 --> 00:35:00,794
to tell the world what
you've been doing there.

476
00:35:01,186 --> 00:35:02,274
No?

477
00:35:03,884 --> 00:35:05,624
How about this?

478
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:07,713
You had her killed.

479
00:35:07,714 --> 00:35:09,280
Elena was found
murdered in her cell,

480
00:35:09,281 --> 00:35:11,196
so the trial never
takes place.

481
00:35:12,588 --> 00:35:15,764
No smoke without fire,
right? So what do you do?

482
00:35:15,765 --> 00:35:18,071
You sit down with your
friends in Parliament,

483
00:35:18,072 --> 00:35:19,551
the press,
social media,

484
00:35:19,552 --> 00:35:22,728
you downplay, deny,
keep the disinformation pumping,

485
00:35:22,729 --> 00:35:25,252
just so long as those
oil licences keep coming

486
00:35:25,253 --> 00:35:27,385
and the Agnian
stock keeps climbing.

487
00:35:27,386 --> 00:35:28,474
Zee.

488
00:35:29,518 --> 00:35:32,869
There's a Taracoa every
month and Elena every week.

489
00:35:33,392 --> 00:35:36,395
And the world does nothing.
Until now.

490
00:35:36,917 --> 00:35:39,701
Tonight you are accountable.

491
00:35:39,702 --> 00:35:41,268
You can't prove any of this.

492
00:35:41,269 --> 00:35:43,444
You're right,
Geoffrey, we can't, but you can.

493
00:35:43,445 --> 00:35:46,927
You fucking cowards.
You won't get away with it.

494
00:35:48,711 --> 00:35:50,191
Did you say 'cowards'?

495
00:35:51,236 --> 00:35:53,759
We've stood before
bulldozers in the Amazon,

496
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,630
been shot at by whalers,

497
00:35:55,631 --> 00:35:59,112
seen our brothers and sisters
killed for what they believe in.

498
00:35:59,113 --> 00:36:00,158
What are you?

499
00:36:01,289 --> 00:36:03,552
You're a fat,
ugly man in a suit.

500
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:07,730
Are you insane?
Are you hearing this?

501
00:36:08,122 --> 00:36:09,557
So this is what's gonna happen.

502
00:36:09,558 --> 00:36:11,777
You are gonna
give Zee your passwords

503
00:36:11,778 --> 00:36:13,213
and she's gonna expunge

504
00:36:13,214 --> 00:36:15,389
every guilty secret
from your accounts.

505
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:18,131
You're then gonna
confess your crimes.

506
00:36:18,132 --> 00:36:20,525
We're gonna shine a
light on every lie,

507
00:36:20,526 --> 00:36:23,223
bribe and abuse
and then reveal it to the world.

508
00:36:23,224 --> 00:36:25,356
Once the truth goes viral,

509
00:36:25,357 --> 00:36:28,576
you and Agnian stock
will be worthless.

510
00:36:28,577 --> 00:36:31,710
Provided you comply,
you will then be released.

511
00:36:31,711 --> 00:36:33,364
By us at least.

512
00:36:33,365 --> 00:36:35,931
What happens beyond that,
out of my hands.

513
00:36:35,932 --> 00:36:37,672
Let's discuss this.

514
00:36:37,673 --> 00:36:40,327
We have everyone here to
give you a platform.

515
00:36:40,328 --> 00:36:44,331
You don't understand,
Geoffrey. You are the platform.

516
00:36:44,332 --> 00:36:46,812
But you said yourself,
you need people onside.

517
00:36:46,813 --> 00:36:50,643
Come on.
We can talk this through.

518
00:37:21,064 --> 00:37:22,021
What the hell
is wrong with you?

519
00:37:22,022 --> 00:37:23,631
Enough fucking talk.

520
00:37:23,632 --> 00:37:25,590
Marcus, you're breaking bread
with them and having a go at me?

521
00:37:25,591 --> 00:37:27,679
- Fuck you.
- We agreed, no killing.

522
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,811
You knew exactly who I
was before you brought me.

523
00:37:29,812 --> 00:37:32,162
Noah, this is not the way.

524
00:37:43,043 --> 00:37:44,435
All flesh is grass, man.

525
00:37:44,436 --> 00:37:46,219
Oh, enough of your
fucking bullshit.

526
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,829
Without me, you
wouldn't have even got in here.

527
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,831
You'd still be on
the outside throwing rocks.

528
00:37:49,832 --> 00:37:54,010
So wind your fucking neck in and
remember what we're here to do.

529
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:11,810
We've got multiple reports

530
00:38:11,811 --> 00:38:13,551
of an SOS at Agnian Tower.

531
00:38:13,552 --> 00:38:15,423
Someone's lit a signal
halfway up the building.

532
00:38:20,733 --> 00:38:22,255
What the fuck is this?

533
00:38:22,256 --> 00:38:24,475
Just
a little extra persuasion.

534
00:38:24,476 --> 00:38:26,215
I hate to interrupt
circle time,

535
00:38:26,216 --> 00:38:28,306
but we have an iceberg on
the horizon.

536
00:38:29,611 --> 00:38:32,439
- Police inbound rapid response.
- How?

537
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,747
There's a fucking SOS
on the side of the building.

538
00:38:35,356 --> 00:38:37,576
- Someone went old school.
- Outside?

539
00:38:38,446 --> 00:38:40,143
What, one of the cleaners?

540
00:38:40,622 --> 00:38:41,754
Find them.

541
00:38:43,451 --> 00:38:45,104
Zee, send
a message to the police

542
00:38:45,105 --> 00:38:47,325
warning we have hostages.

543
00:38:59,946 --> 00:39:01,034
No.

544
00:39:03,036 --> 00:39:04,429
Noah, we have a runner.

545
00:39:15,614 --> 00:39:18,486
The cleaner's
not going anywhere. Get Gerald.

546
00:39:19,269 --> 00:39:20,835
Zee, there's
an override to the cradle.

547
00:39:20,836 --> 00:39:22,010
Sweet.

548
00:39:22,011 --> 00:39:24,710
Bring her up. Bring her in.

549
00:40:22,507 --> 00:40:25,640
That was very,
very stupid, Gerald.

550
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:29,209
Window cleaner banjaxed
the cradle. She's stuck.

551
00:40:29,644 --> 00:40:31,384
- One down from you.
- Fuck her.

552
00:40:31,385 --> 00:40:32,734
Let her sweat.

553
00:40:37,826 --> 00:40:40,393
You've already killed one
Milton. We can't lose 'em both.

554
00:40:40,394 --> 00:40:42,570
Nobody's listening to you,
Marcus.

555
00:40:47,357 --> 00:40:49,055
What is this, a fucking coup?

556
00:40:49,795 --> 00:40:51,230
- Put the gun down.
- You know,

557
00:40:51,231 --> 00:40:52,623
I don't think I will.

558
00:40:52,624 --> 00:40:54,581
You wanna pull this
shit when we're this close?

559
00:40:54,582 --> 00:40:56,540
But we're not close,
are we? We're not fucking close.

560
00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:59,020
You stupid, arrogant bastard.

561
00:40:59,021 --> 00:41:03,155
Nothing has changed,
bro. The world is still dying.

562
00:41:03,156 --> 00:41:04,635
Fuck this hearts and
minds bullshit.

563
00:41:04,636 --> 00:41:06,071
It's time for some
shock and awe.

564
00:41:06,072 --> 00:41:09,901
Noah, put the fucking
gun down or I'll put you down.

565
00:41:23,959 --> 00:41:28,181
No, you won't.
That's why I have to do this.

566
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:31,924
See, you, you're lucky,
Gerry. You, I need.

567
00:41:35,623 --> 00:41:37,798
But I'm in now, Marcus,

568
00:41:37,799 --> 00:41:40,280
and I'm gonna be throwing
a lot more than fucking rocks.

569
00:41:47,243 --> 00:41:50,464
I'm only gonna ask you this
once, Wyatt. Are you in or out?

570
00:41:55,861 --> 00:41:56,862
Zee?

571
00:41:58,472 --> 00:41:59,908
Looks like I'm all in.

572
00:42:00,605 --> 00:42:02,649
Look, I'm sorry,
man. Really, I am.

573
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:04,999
But you still think
that people are the solution.

574
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,698
People are the problem.

575
00:42:08,047 --> 00:42:10,310
I mean, look at me.

576
00:42:12,181 --> 00:42:15,576
It's too late for a revolution,
Marcus. This is a reckoning.

577
00:42:16,272 --> 00:42:18,536
Zee, stream this to our guests.

578
00:42:21,147 --> 00:42:25,150
So, Gerry's had his fun, and
after a brief chat with Marcus,

579
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:27,675
the headline is we're
now under new management.

580
00:42:28,371 --> 00:42:32,244
I know some of you were loyal
to Marcus, but that's done.

581
00:42:32,245 --> 00:42:36,727
It's my way now. Same broad
strokes, just a few key changes.

582
00:42:36,728 --> 00:42:38,773
True believers only.

583
00:42:51,525 --> 00:42:54,310
Every movement
needs its martyrs.

584
00:42:59,794 --> 00:43:02,492
Who's on the outside now?

585
00:43:22,948 --> 00:43:24,036
Try running now.

586
00:43:28,257 --> 00:43:30,694
As soon as we're done, you
get the explosives ready, okay?

587
00:43:30,695 --> 00:43:33,348
What about your cleaner?
We should get rid of her.

588
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:35,046
And we've a chopper inbound.

589
00:43:35,047 --> 00:43:36,264
Helicopter in the air.

590
00:43:36,265 --> 00:43:37,876
That's full pig bingo.

591
00:43:40,966 --> 00:43:43,316
Please tell me this shitshow
comes with a fucking plan.

592
00:43:43,795 --> 00:43:46,927
Relax, Zee. They're
still coming clean tonight.

593
00:43:46,928 --> 00:43:49,060
You're still gonna dig
through all their dirty laundry.

594
00:43:49,061 --> 00:43:52,716
Marcus was right about one
thing. The truth does matter.

595
00:43:52,717 --> 00:43:54,718
Without it, they'll just
smear us as cranks and crazies,

596
00:43:54,719 --> 00:43:56,241
a bunch of murdering psychos,

597
00:43:56,242 --> 00:43:58,678
but the truth by itself
changes nothing.

598
00:44:02,988 --> 00:44:04,075
Strap 'em up.

599
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:47,945
You've got this,
Joey, like riding a bike,

600
00:44:47,946 --> 00:44:50,599
700 feet high in
a mangled fucking cradle

601
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,036
having dead bodies
thrown at you.

602
00:45:15,277 --> 00:45:17,452
I really wish you
weren't here right now.

603
00:45:17,453 --> 00:45:18,976
Derek had to be Derek.

604
00:45:18,977 --> 00:45:20,065
Course he did.

605
00:45:23,851 --> 00:45:26,419
Now, are you gonna try
and talk me out of it too, Joey?

606
00:45:27,028 --> 00:45:28,202
Like he did? No.

607
00:45:28,203 --> 00:45:29,464
Okay.

608
00:45:29,465 --> 00:45:31,076
You're killing people, Noah.

609
00:45:31,946 --> 00:45:33,686
I am killing people,

610
00:45:33,687 --> 00:45:35,644
the ones that get in my way.
But it's not personal.

611
00:45:35,645 --> 00:45:36,994
Actually, you know what?
Fuck that.

612
00:45:36,995 --> 00:45:39,039
It is kind of deeply personal.

613
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,696
But everyone's got a personal,
Joey. What's yours?

614
00:45:44,045 --> 00:45:45,264
And Michael?

615
00:45:47,222 --> 00:45:48,832
Please tell me
he's not still here.

616
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:50,835
He left. Got bored waiting.

617
00:45:53,272 --> 00:45:55,664
Hey, guys, our cleaner's
little brother, Michael Locke,

618
00:45:55,665 --> 00:45:57,144
is somewhere in the building.

619
00:45:57,145 --> 00:45:58,798
Zee'll send you
a picture of him now.

620
00:45:58,799 --> 00:46:00,845
Could you find him
and bring him to me?

621
00:46:01,628 --> 00:46:03,369
Poor fucking bastard.

622
00:46:04,109 --> 00:46:06,850
You leave him stuck in
some shithole home for years.

623
00:46:06,851 --> 00:46:08,590
You talk about him
like he's an embarrassment.

624
00:46:08,591 --> 00:46:10,114
Like somehow you've
had it tougher than him.

625
00:46:10,115 --> 00:46:12,203
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is fucking true.

626
00:46:12,204 --> 00:46:13,726
Don't lie to yourself
right now, Joey.

627
00:46:13,727 --> 00:46:16,207
And then the one time
that you are here for him,

628
00:46:16,208 --> 00:46:17,817
you bring him into this.

629
00:46:17,818 --> 00:46:20,515
Sister of the fucking year,
you are.

630
00:46:20,516 --> 00:46:21,952
If you touch him...

631
00:46:21,953 --> 00:46:24,476
- I thought he'd left.
- I will end you.

632
00:46:24,477 --> 00:46:26,784
Oooh. That's a bit dark,
isn't it?

633
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,875
I told you. Personal.

634
00:46:33,573 --> 00:46:35,705
My name is Denise Slater.

635
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,883
I am the minister for energy.

636
00:46:39,274 --> 00:46:42,755
I speak to you
today to confess to actions

637
00:46:42,756 --> 00:46:45,803
- that I can no longer conceal.
- Fuck. Come on.

638
00:46:46,151 --> 00:46:48,892
For years, I have
accepted bribes from Agnian.

639
00:46:48,893 --> 00:46:51,895
I received in
excess of £2 million

640
00:46:51,896 --> 00:46:54,723
to obstruct
an inquiry into Agnian's site...

641
00:46:54,724 --> 00:46:55,899
Sierra Oscar.

642
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:57,814
Units on route
to the Agnian Tower.

643
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,424
We're way off on the hack.

644
00:46:59,425 --> 00:47:01,948
They've only just
started spilling their guts.

645
00:47:01,949 --> 00:47:04,516
And we've got maybe two
minutes till the feds show.

646
00:47:04,517 --> 00:47:07,519
Noah, we're not ready.
We need more time.

647
00:47:12,394 --> 00:47:14,266
Your guests are almost here.

648
00:47:14,701 --> 00:47:18,052
You invited them,
Joey. This is your night.

649
00:47:26,713 --> 00:47:28,496
999.

650
00:47:28,497 --> 00:47:31,499
There's a crazy woman outside
the Agnian Tower with a gun.

651
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:35,764
She's gonna kill someone. You
need to get here. Get here now.

652
00:47:35,765 --> 00:47:36,810
You fucking psycho.

653
00:47:37,593 --> 00:47:39,986
- I thought we were friends.
- I thought we were friends.

654
00:47:39,987 --> 00:47:41,858
Well, friends help each other,
don't they?

655
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:44,251
So why don't you
point that gun at the street,

656
00:47:44,252 --> 00:47:46,340
straight down,
and empty the clip?

657
00:47:46,341 --> 00:47:47,865
Go fuck yourself.

658
00:47:51,433 --> 00:47:53,173
Oh, shit.

659
00:47:53,174 --> 00:47:56,307
Look who it is.
Halina.

660
00:47:56,308 --> 00:47:59,092
- She's nothing to do with them.
- She takes their money. Shoot.

661
00:47:59,093 --> 00:48:00,572
- Noah, she's pregnant.
- Even more of a reason.

662
00:48:00,573 --> 00:48:02,617
This is no world to be bringing
a kid into, now, is it?

663
00:48:02,618 --> 00:48:04,141
Don't do it, please.

664
00:48:04,142 --> 00:48:05,577
If you don't want her to die,

665
00:48:05,578 --> 00:48:07,144
all you have to do is
get shooting.

666
00:48:07,145 --> 00:48:09,624
Lose the silencer.
Let's make a bang.

667
00:48:09,625 --> 00:48:11,931
And no easy shots.

668
00:48:11,932 --> 00:48:13,673
Make 'em dance.

669
00:48:41,266 --> 00:48:44,922
See? I told you.
Like fucking ants.

670
00:49:12,601 --> 00:49:14,429
Okay, got the target.

671
00:49:20,653 --> 00:49:22,436
Let's go! Everybody! Now!

672
00:49:22,437 --> 00:49:26,092
Out! Come on!
Come on! Quickly, move!

673
00:49:26,093 --> 00:49:29,487
- Out, out! Go, go, go! Come on!
- This way.

674
00:49:29,488 --> 00:49:30,924
Out now!

675
00:49:40,499 --> 00:49:41,890
You're sick!

676
00:49:41,891 --> 00:49:43,676
I'll let you know
when we find Mikey.

677
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:46,460
POLICE [On megaphone]:
Turn around.

678
00:49:46,461 --> 00:49:48,463
Put your hands in the air.

679
00:49:57,516 --> 00:50:01,649
We're hearing reports that
the Agnian Tower is under siege.

680
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:04,043
While we are awaiting
confirmation of hostages,

681
00:50:04,044 --> 00:50:06,524
we can confirm that
several shots

682
00:50:06,525 --> 00:50:09,179
were fired from halfway up
the building itself

683
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:11,312
by an as yet unidentified woman.

684
00:50:12,052 --> 00:50:13,661
I think it's fair to
say the cleaner

685
00:50:13,662 --> 00:50:15,011
has their full attention.

686
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,621
Well,
let's make sure she keeps it.

687
00:50:16,622 --> 00:50:18,666
Transfer some
of the Milton brothers' funds

688
00:50:18,667 --> 00:50:19,754
into Joanna Locke's account.

689
00:50:19,755 --> 00:50:22,410
Say, 33 million.

690
00:50:23,324 --> 00:50:24,891
I'm sorry. How many million?

691
00:50:27,502 --> 00:50:29,025
- Guv.
- Yes.

692
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:30,896
Ground commander for the night.
Lucky you, right?

693
00:50:30,897 --> 00:50:33,203
Yeah, lucky me.
Right, what we got?

694
00:50:33,204 --> 00:50:36,467
Nothing on the hostages yet.
Shareholder event for Agnian.

695
00:50:36,468 --> 00:50:38,860
We have workers,
staff and high-profile guests,

696
00:50:38,861 --> 00:50:42,255
including Denise Slater,
the minister for energy.

697
00:50:42,256 --> 00:50:45,041
We have 102 phone signals,
all non-responsive.

698
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:46,868
No demands as yet,
but the SOS was followed

699
00:50:46,869 --> 00:50:48,566
by a coded
warning about the hostages,

700
00:50:48,567 --> 00:50:49,436
then the call
about the shooter.

701
00:50:49,437 --> 00:50:51,003
Casualties?

702
00:50:51,004 --> 00:50:53,484
One body on the cradle with
the shooter. None on the ground.

703
00:50:53,485 --> 00:50:56,182
Spotters have ID'd
the shooter as Joanna Locke,

704
00:50:56,183 --> 00:50:57,662
one of the window cleaners.

705
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:59,142
Ex-army. SRR.

706
00:50:59,143 --> 00:51:00,665
Made it through
Marine selection,

707
00:51:00,666 --> 00:51:03,102
only to assault a squad mate,
then quit.

708
00:51:03,103 --> 00:51:05,800
Troubled childhood,
abusive father, brother in care.

709
00:51:05,801 --> 00:51:08,020
Drug fines, self-medicating.

710
00:51:08,021 --> 00:51:10,850
- Classic unstable ex-soldier.
- Yeah, maybe.

711
00:51:11,938 --> 00:51:13,330
Get urgent authorities in place

712
00:51:13,331 --> 00:51:15,419
for her socials,
her phones, her finances.

713
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:16,985
You know, a deep,
detailed picture,

714
00:51:16,986 --> 00:51:19,292
not a way too easy, lazy answer.

715
00:51:19,293 --> 00:51:21,207
Yes, guv. Sorry, guv.

716
00:51:21,208 --> 00:51:23,079
No, you could be right.
Let's see.

717
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,124
We're gonna have to ruin
the commissioner's bridge night.

718
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:27,561
He'll need to brief the home
secretary and the mayor.

719
00:51:27,562 --> 00:51:29,041
Who have we got from SCO19?

720
00:51:29,042 --> 00:51:31,478
- Stormin' Norman.
- Yeah, course. Who else?

721
00:51:31,479 --> 00:51:34,481
Right, well, if I get too
punchy, just give me the signal.

722
00:51:34,482 --> 00:51:37,398
Yes, guv.
What do I do when you ignore it?

723
00:51:38,573 --> 00:51:39,748
Speak of the devil.

724
00:51:40,706 --> 00:51:42,359
- Snipers are in place, ma'am.
- Thank you.

725
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:44,012
Yes, we need to make
contact with the shooter,

726
00:51:44,013 --> 00:51:45,319
work out what
the hell is going on.

727
00:51:46,755 --> 00:51:50,019
- Waiting for your mark.
- Yes, I heard. Thank you.

728
00:51:54,546 --> 00:51:55,764
I've got the shot.

729
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,159
I'm not with them!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

730
00:51:59,681 --> 00:52:00,899
I'm not one for doing nothing.

731
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,074
We're not doing nothing, Royce.

732
00:52:02,075 --> 00:52:03,771
We're waiting
till we learn more.

733
00:52:03,772 --> 00:52:05,512
If she lit that sign
because she wanted attention,

734
00:52:05,513 --> 00:52:07,427
she's not putting on
much of a show,

735
00:52:07,428 --> 00:52:09,212
no matter how much someone
wants us to think that.

736
00:52:09,213 --> 00:52:11,039
Nobody makes
a move unless I say so.

737
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,563
- Ma'am.
- Hmm?

738
00:52:12,564 --> 00:52:15,131
Thirty-three million just landed
in Joanna Locke's account.

739
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,828
From the Milton brothers.

740
00:52:16,829 --> 00:52:18,960
She's just fired seven rounds
into St. Thomas's Street.

741
00:52:18,961 --> 00:52:20,310
Into the street.

742
00:52:20,311 --> 00:52:22,834
Now, either that's blind luck
or she's ex-SRR,

743
00:52:22,835 --> 00:52:25,751
she knows exactly how
to hit a target and miss one.

744
00:52:26,317 --> 00:52:27,795
Unless she's unstable.

745
00:52:35,587 --> 00:52:36,717
She's going
for the body.

746
00:52:36,718 --> 00:52:38,111
Hold your fire.

747
00:52:56,303 --> 00:52:58,218
She's holding a device.

748
00:53:19,283 --> 00:53:21,240
999. What's
your emergency?

749
00:53:21,241 --> 00:53:23,635
Are you fucking kidding me?

750
00:53:32,687 --> 00:53:35,342
Guv. For you. It's Joey Locke.

751
00:53:36,517 --> 00:53:38,389
Tell the chopper to back off.

752
00:53:40,739 --> 00:53:41,826
Hello, Joey?

753
00:53:41,827 --> 00:53:44,003
Don't shoot!
I'm not with them.

754
00:53:44,351 --> 00:53:45,570
We won't shoot.

755
00:53:46,484 --> 00:53:48,702
This is
Superintendent Claire Hume.

756
00:53:48,703 --> 00:53:50,487
And I repeat,
we will not shoot.

757
00:53:50,488 --> 00:53:51,749
Great.

758
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:53,577
We're gonna get you
down as soon as we can.

759
00:53:53,578 --> 00:53:55,796
Forget about me.
You need to get inside.

760
00:53:55,797 --> 00:53:58,538
- And we will.
- My brother's in the building.

761
00:53:58,539 --> 00:54:00,845
- His name is Michael Locke.
- We're gonna get him too.

762
00:54:00,846 --> 00:54:03,413
You have to find him,
please. Please.

763
00:54:03,414 --> 00:54:05,763
You mentioned a 'them'?

764
00:54:05,764 --> 00:54:09,593
My news outlets,
under my personal direction,

765
00:54:09,594 --> 00:54:15,642
have consistently,
repeatedly, perpetuated the myth

766
00:54:15,643 --> 00:54:18,602
- that climate change is a hoax.
- Naughty boy.

767
00:54:18,603 --> 00:54:20,299
It's time to admit my complicity

768
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,475
in the downplaying
of climate change.

769
00:54:22,476 --> 00:54:24,564
I didn't do anything.
I shouldn't be here.

770
00:54:24,565 --> 00:54:28,176
Hey, hey, hey. Don't
undersell yourself, Jennifer.

771
00:54:28,177 --> 00:54:30,396
You know where all
the bodies are buried.

772
00:54:30,397 --> 00:54:33,051
Now, you can either
tell us where to dig,

773
00:54:33,052 --> 00:54:35,097
or you can join Geoff here.

774
00:54:39,406 --> 00:54:42,191
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is he freaking you out?

775
00:54:43,062 --> 00:54:44,585
Do you want me to move him?

776
00:54:47,588 --> 00:54:48,720
No.

777
00:54:59,252 --> 00:55:01,123
Someone needs to get inside.

778
00:55:01,646 --> 00:55:03,124
Oh, believe me, we're on it.
We just need to assess.

779
00:55:03,125 --> 00:55:04,778
Hume, listen to me...

780
00:55:04,779 --> 00:55:07,433
Joey, I'm gonna have to call you
back, but we will get you down.

781
00:55:07,434 --> 00:55:09,957
I don't wanna get down.
I wanna get in.

782
00:55:09,958 --> 00:55:11,220
Fuck!

783
00:55:11,612 --> 00:55:14,135
Noah Santos.
No socials and no record.

784
00:55:14,136 --> 00:55:15,833
Clean as a whistle.

785
00:55:15,834 --> 00:55:19,446
I cross-checked his work ID.
They match with this guy.

786
00:55:20,186 --> 00:55:22,492
He was calling
himself Lucas Vander then,

787
00:55:22,493 --> 00:55:26,234
a member of the Seventh Harvest,
an anti-humanist group.

788
00:55:26,235 --> 00:55:28,629
- Anti-humanist? As in...?
- As in...

789
00:55:29,064 --> 00:55:31,022
Man is a blight upon the world.

790
00:55:31,023 --> 00:55:32,893
A cancer, a virus.

791
00:55:32,894 --> 00:55:34,852
And for the human
virus to be controlled

792
00:55:34,853 --> 00:55:37,769
requires a radical,
invasive approach.

793
00:55:38,073 --> 00:55:39,726
Delightful.

794
00:55:39,727 --> 00:55:41,772
Close to no followers.
On the fringes of the fringe.

795
00:55:41,773 --> 00:55:44,252
Not even worth
putting on the watch list.

796
00:55:44,253 --> 00:55:45,689
But last year
he shows up in the orbit

797
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:48,040
of someone who
was on the watch list.

798
00:55:48,693 --> 00:55:49,823
Marcus Blake.

799
00:55:49,824 --> 00:55:51,825
The man we just
peeled off the pavement.

800
00:55:51,826 --> 00:55:54,915
Leader of Earth Revolution,
a radical environmental group.

801
00:55:54,916 --> 00:55:57,701
Extreme but organised.
Well connected, well resourced.

802
00:55:57,702 --> 00:55:59,877
Linked to the sabotage
of the Dakar refinery

803
00:55:59,878 --> 00:56:02,183
and the Laguna Taracoa
facility last year.

804
00:56:02,184 --> 00:56:03,837
Laguna Taracoa? That's Agnian.

805
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:06,710
There were warnings given
at those attacks. No casualties.

806
00:56:06,711 --> 00:56:09,669
One was arrested at Taracoa,
practically handed herself in.

807
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:13,847
It's the Earth Revolution MO.
Get attention, make their case.

808
00:56:13,848 --> 00:56:15,936
Only this time, Elena Lanza
gets herself knifed

809
00:56:15,937 --> 00:56:17,809
in jail for the cause.

810
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:21,377
So, Marcus Blake,
an extremist, not a killer.

811
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:22,988
Now he's dead,

812
00:56:23,510 --> 00:56:25,643
murdered by Noah Santos.

813
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:27,471
Dial me in.

814
00:56:29,037 --> 00:56:30,169
Do it.

815
00:56:32,693 --> 00:56:34,781
The first casualty
at the Agnian siege in London

816
00:56:34,782 --> 00:56:37,436
has been
identified as environmentalist

817
00:56:37,437 --> 00:56:40,092
and radical
eco-activist Marcus Blake.

818
00:56:40,701 --> 00:56:42,528
With Blake dead, it is
not yet clear

819
00:56:42,529 --> 00:56:46,359
who is in control of what is a
rapidly escalating situation.

820
00:56:55,194 --> 00:56:57,325
Through no choice of my own,

821
00:56:57,326 --> 00:57:00,894
I, James Horsley,
am compelled to reveal the truth

822
00:57:00,895 --> 00:57:07,336
about my part in regards to
Agnian and the Milton brothers.

823
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:10,556
I personally oversaw the payment
of millions in settlements

824
00:57:10,557 --> 00:57:13,211
to silence whistleblowers
and complainants.

825
00:57:13,212 --> 00:57:15,300
All people are like grass
and all their faithfulness

826
00:57:15,301 --> 00:57:16,736
like the flowers in the field.

827
00:57:16,737 --> 00:57:18,608
Grass withers
and the flowers fall,

828
00:57:18,609 --> 00:57:20,698
but the breath
of the Lord remains forever.

829
00:57:21,481 --> 00:57:24,136
- You good?
- I'm terrified.

830
00:57:29,924 --> 00:57:31,751
What happens if
it loses my pulse?

831
00:57:31,752 --> 00:57:34,755
You'll have about five seconds
for it to find it again.

832
00:57:45,331 --> 00:57:46,463
Good to know.

833
00:57:47,202 --> 00:57:49,160
Superintendent Claire Hume
is on the line.

834
00:57:49,161 --> 00:57:50,944
Hmm, patch her through.

835
00:57:50,945 --> 00:57:53,426
Are you still with
us for phase two, Zee?

836
00:57:55,167 --> 00:57:56,560
Yes.

837
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:00,172
Great to have you onboard.

838
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,783
- Noah Santos?
- Detective Claire Hume.

839
00:58:03,784 --> 00:58:06,351
Superintendent. But,
then, I think you knew that.

840
00:58:06,352 --> 00:58:08,788
Would you prefer Noah or Lucas?

841
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:11,356
Let's stick with Noah.
I outgrew Lucas.

842
00:58:11,357 --> 00:58:12,618
Are you in charge
down there, Claire?

843
00:58:12,619 --> 00:58:14,751
Yes. You in charge up there?

844
00:58:14,752 --> 00:58:16,361
I am now, yeah.

845
00:58:16,362 --> 00:58:17,971
What happened
with Marcus Blake?

846
00:58:17,972 --> 00:58:19,451
Creative differences.

847
00:58:19,452 --> 00:58:21,801
Your boys in the chopper
and on the rooftops should know

848
00:58:21,802 --> 00:58:24,151
that I'm wearing a dead man's
switch synched to my pulse,

849
00:58:24,152 --> 00:58:27,285
so if my heart stops beating,
the whole building explodes.

850
00:58:27,286 --> 00:58:28,939
Likewise,
any attempt to gain access,

851
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:31,768
cutting the power,
and I start detonating hostages.

852
00:58:31,769 --> 00:58:34,858
If you think I might blink,
ask Marcus Blake.

853
00:58:42,170 --> 00:58:43,997
As the CEO of Beacon Social...

854
00:58:43,998 --> 00:58:45,782
Gerald
and the board are confessing

855
00:58:45,783 --> 00:58:47,566
to their systemic
violation of the planet.

856
00:58:47,567 --> 00:58:49,133
They're far from
the only guilty ones.

857
00:58:49,134 --> 00:58:51,135
You're putting
them on trial.

858
00:58:51,136 --> 00:58:53,398
Tonight's about consequences,
Claire. You reap what you sow.

859
00:58:53,399 --> 00:58:54,617
Okay, well, while
they're confessing,

860
00:58:54,618 --> 00:58:55,966
why don't we let the others go?

861
00:58:55,967 --> 00:58:57,402
I understand you have
issues with the Miltons,

862
00:58:57,403 --> 00:58:58,882
but you have people in there

863
00:58:58,883 --> 00:59:01,275
who are guilty of nothing more
than showing up for work.

864
00:59:01,276 --> 00:59:02,886
They're enabling
parasites.

865
00:59:02,887 --> 00:59:04,540
Nobody gets a free pass.

866
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,454
Why aren't
the others moving, Noah?

867
00:59:06,455 --> 00:59:10,198
Ahh. Inhalational anaesthetic.
They'll be out long enough.

868
00:59:10,938 --> 00:59:14,680
Long enough for...? What are
you trying to achieve tonight?

869
00:59:14,681 --> 00:59:16,377
You know, justice,

870
00:59:16,378 --> 00:59:19,293
saving the world,
that kind of thing.

871
00:59:19,294 --> 00:59:20,773
Big ask.

872
00:59:20,774 --> 00:59:24,038
You don't strike me as the naive
type, Noah. Blake, maybe.

873
00:59:24,735 --> 00:59:26,605
See, you have to see
the long game here, Claire.

874
00:59:26,606 --> 00:59:27,867
You didn't listen to the Gretas.

875
00:59:27,868 --> 00:59:29,347
You wouldn't listen
to the Marcus's.

876
00:59:29,348 --> 00:59:31,654
You lose your shit if someone
throws oil at a painting,

877
00:59:31,655 --> 00:59:33,612
blocks the motorway,
crashes the big match.

878
00:59:33,613 --> 00:59:36,136
Well, too late, because
now you get someone like me.

879
00:59:36,137 --> 00:59:38,008
I'm struggling to join the dots
between strapping

880
00:59:38,009 --> 00:59:40,837
explosives to innocent people
and saving the world.

881
00:59:40,838 --> 00:59:42,665
See, your first mistake
is thinking that anyone

882
00:59:42,666 --> 00:59:43,840
in here is innocent.

883
00:59:43,841 --> 00:59:45,842
Do you hate people, Noah?

884
00:59:45,843 --> 00:59:47,887
I hate what we've
done to the world, yeah.

885
00:59:47,888 --> 00:59:50,107
I mean, you're talking
about saving, what, 100 people?

886
00:59:50,108 --> 00:59:52,675
These bastards have been raping
the planet and getting fat on it

887
00:59:52,676 --> 00:59:54,372
and you still
think I'm the bad guy.

888
00:59:54,373 --> 00:59:55,982
So this is
a numbers game for you.

889
00:59:55,983 --> 00:59:57,462
There we go.

890
01:00:02,381 --> 01:00:04,034
Speaking of numbers, Claire,

891
01:00:04,035 --> 01:00:06,907
why are there five SWAT guys
sniffing around the entrance?

892
01:00:08,169 --> 01:00:09,822
Get them back now.

893
01:00:09,823 --> 01:00:12,564
- Pull back. Pull back!
- We're moving back, Noah.

894
01:00:12,565 --> 01:00:15,045
Great, cos you have
five seconds, one per guy.

895
01:00:15,046 --> 01:00:16,482
We're moving back.

896
01:00:18,658 --> 01:00:20,311
And three, two...

897
01:00:20,312 --> 01:00:22,357
I told you, we're back.

898
01:00:24,272 --> 01:00:26,840
Well done, Claire. Thank you.

899
01:00:41,289 --> 01:00:44,292
- Still there?
- They have families, Noah.

900
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:47,947
Well, now they don't. Like
you said, it's a numbers game.

901
01:00:47,948 --> 01:00:50,558
What kind of numbers
depend on you, so till I'm done,

902
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,518
stay the fuck back.

903
01:00:53,301 --> 01:00:56,783
Don't you
ever go behind my back again!

904
01:00:59,394 --> 01:01:00,917
Five police officers

905
01:01:00,918 --> 01:01:03,702
have been killed in a blast
at the Agnian Tower siege

906
01:01:03,703 --> 01:01:07,010
in what is becoming a truly
horrific night for London.

907
01:01:07,011 --> 01:01:09,839
The men were all
serving SCO19 officers.

908
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,884
Anti-humanist terrorist,
Noah Santos,

909
01:01:11,885 --> 01:01:13,581
has yet to make any demands,

910
01:01:13,582 --> 01:01:16,716
and so far no
hostages have been released.

911
01:01:22,548 --> 01:01:24,680
- Joey.
- I warned you.

912
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:26,029
What the hell are you thinking?

913
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:28,292
Noah's hooked up
to a dead man's switch,

914
01:01:28,293 --> 01:01:30,903
so we can't move our teams in,
we can't get the hostages out.

915
01:01:30,904 --> 01:01:32,426
He's got us by the balls.

916
01:01:32,427 --> 01:01:34,341
You, maybe. I'm going in.

917
01:01:34,342 --> 01:01:36,735
- How are you gonna do that?
- I'm working on it.

918
01:01:36,736 --> 01:01:38,869
Is there anything
else you can tell me?

919
01:01:39,173 --> 01:01:41,044
We know that
Noah's after confessions

920
01:01:41,045 --> 01:01:43,350
and Agnian files before
he goes live with it all,

921
01:01:43,351 --> 01:01:46,049
and we think he's running
it through the control room.

922
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:47,573
I'll do my best.

923
01:01:48,269 --> 01:01:49,574
You wanna hang this
whole operation

924
01:01:49,575 --> 01:01:51,184
on a window cleaner
who couldn't hack the army?

925
01:01:51,185 --> 01:01:53,752
At least she didn't just send
five men to their deaths, Royce.

926
01:01:53,753 --> 01:01:56,147
We need an opening
and she can give us one.

927
01:02:01,326 --> 01:02:04,328
Helping the pigs, that's
a new low, even for you, Joey.

928
01:02:04,329 --> 01:02:06,809
Oh, I don't know. Beats murder.

929
01:02:06,810 --> 01:02:08,332
I'm sorry that you stayed late,

930
01:02:08,333 --> 01:02:09,942
I'm sorry that you got
in my way,

931
01:02:09,943 --> 01:02:11,944
and I'm sorry that you can't
see what I'm trying to do here,

932
01:02:11,945 --> 01:02:13,293
but that's irrelevant,

933
01:02:13,294 --> 01:02:15,339
because by the end of tonight,
everyone will see,

934
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:16,994
and you're not stopping them.

935
01:02:17,777 --> 01:02:19,430
Repeat,
I have visuals on an IED.

936
01:02:19,431 --> 01:02:20,823
Joey, you need to move now.

937
01:02:20,824 --> 01:02:22,564
Explosives coming your way.

938
01:02:33,358 --> 01:02:35,621
Come on, Joey. Come on.

939
01:03:15,835 --> 01:03:19,055
I knew that
the Agnian brand was associated

940
01:03:19,056 --> 01:03:22,320
with pollution and exploitation.

941
01:03:23,277 --> 01:03:25,584
I knew the Miltons'
reputation...

942
01:03:26,454 --> 01:03:30,501
and I knowingly helped
to rebrand and greenwash

943
01:03:30,502 --> 01:03:33,112
Agnian's criminal...

944
01:03:33,113 --> 01:03:36,289
She's dead.
We have visual confirmation.

945
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:37,988
Joanna Locke is dead.

946
01:03:39,511 --> 01:03:42,730
Messy. Bye-bye, bitch.

947
01:03:42,731 --> 01:03:44,516
If you believe that.

948
01:03:56,136 --> 01:03:58,616
Come on, Joey.
Tell me you're still there.

949
01:03:58,617 --> 01:04:00,052
Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.

950
01:04:00,053 --> 01:04:01,662
Thank God for that.
Are you okay?

951
01:04:01,663 --> 01:04:03,316
I'm okay.

952
01:04:03,317 --> 01:04:05,928
Stay dead.
It'll buy us some time.

953
01:04:05,929 --> 01:04:06,973
Right.

954
01:04:07,974 --> 01:04:10,759
Hopefully they won't see me
climbing in through that hole.

955
01:04:11,325 --> 01:04:12,587
What hole?

956
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:15,242
The one your snipers are
gonna put through the glass.

957
01:04:17,201 --> 01:04:18,593
On it.

958
01:04:24,948 --> 01:04:27,906
As the personal assistant
to the Milton brothers,

959
01:04:27,907 --> 01:04:31,563
I've been a silent
witness to a web of corruption.

960
01:04:32,781 --> 01:04:34,478
Splitting the team's a risk.

961
01:04:34,479 --> 01:04:36,220
So is assuming she's dead.

962
01:04:37,003 --> 01:04:39,178
I need an update, Zee.

963
01:04:39,179 --> 01:04:41,093
By the time you get Gerald's
confession, I'll be done.

964
01:04:41,094 --> 01:04:42,529
Go.

965
01:04:42,530 --> 01:04:45,882
I've allowed
myself to be manipulated...

966
01:04:48,232 --> 01:04:49,537
You're up, Gerry.

967
01:04:50,712 --> 01:04:53,192
What do you care what we say?

968
01:04:53,193 --> 01:04:55,673
Do you really think anybody will
listen after what you've done?

969
01:04:55,674 --> 01:05:00,721
Without the truth, no.
With the truth, enough will.

970
01:05:00,722 --> 01:05:02,854
We're making
history tonight, Gerry.

971
01:05:02,855 --> 01:05:04,638
And you'll let us go?

972
01:05:04,639 --> 01:05:07,120
You have my word that we're
all going out the same way.

973
01:05:07,381 --> 01:05:08,947
We've just received
this statement

974
01:05:08,948 --> 01:05:11,211
from the Mayor of London
denouncing Noah Santos.

975
01:05:11,603 --> 01:05:14,257
She says: 'I condemn this
senseless violence

976
01:05:14,258 --> 01:05:16,607
and murder in the
strongest terms.'

977
01:05:16,608 --> 01:05:18,522
'There can be no
justification whatsoever

978
01:05:18,523 --> 01:05:20,872
for these
barbaric acts.'

979
01:05:20,873 --> 01:05:23,571
'This is not activism.
It is terrorism.'

980
01:05:44,027 --> 01:05:47,029
So, I know you
need to concentrate...

981
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:48,856
Don't stop.

982
01:05:48,857 --> 01:05:51,120
Takes my mind off the
massive fall

983
01:05:51,121 --> 01:05:52,818
and the dickheads with guns.

984
01:05:53,775 --> 01:05:57,214
Climbing's the easy bit.
Been doing it since I was six.

985
01:05:58,171 --> 01:06:00,216
How's the team with me going in?

986
01:06:00,217 --> 01:06:02,566
Bet they loved me
bailing on the army.

987
01:06:02,567 --> 01:06:05,047
Well, not to stress
you out or anything...

988
01:06:05,048 --> 01:06:07,788
- You wanna know why I quit?
- You served four years.

989
01:06:07,789 --> 01:06:10,662
You made it all the way through
selection only to walk away.

990
01:06:14,796 --> 01:06:16,580
I grew up watching an
angry man act out

991
01:06:16,581 --> 01:06:18,799
on everyone else
and I did nothing about it.

992
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,888
Get to the commando course,

993
01:06:20,889 --> 01:06:22,281
one of the pricks I beat

994
01:06:22,282 --> 01:06:24,022
couldn't handle being
beaten by a woman.

995
01:06:24,023 --> 01:06:25,067
Huh.

996
01:06:25,068 --> 01:06:26,503
He baited me, I bit.

997
01:06:26,504 --> 01:06:28,419
Quit before they could bin me.

998
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:30,420
Could have fought your corner.

999
01:06:30,421 --> 01:06:33,989
No, you don't do that.
Except this time.

1000
01:06:37,254 --> 01:06:39,343
This time it's
not just my corner.

1001
01:06:41,736 --> 01:06:42,868
Michael.

1002
01:06:44,304 --> 01:06:46,740
Whenever our dad
started on Michael,

1003
01:06:46,741 --> 01:06:49,135
I'd open the window, climb out,

1004
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:52,225
sit on the ledge
till it was over.

1005
01:06:54,053 --> 01:06:55,446
This time I'm not leaving him.

1006
01:06:56,186 --> 01:06:58,100
I can be stubborn when I want.

1007
01:06:58,101 --> 01:07:01,190
Me too. Stubborn's
just what we need right now.

1008
01:07:01,191 --> 01:07:03,496
How does being stubborn
and hostage negotiation work?

1009
01:07:03,497 --> 01:07:05,020
Well, better
at work than at home.

1010
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:06,804
You're a train wreck too?

1011
01:07:06,805 --> 01:07:11,026
Well, what do you want first?
Marriage one, two, three?

1012
01:07:14,552 --> 01:07:15,595
Right, listen, they're gonna be
onto you soon,

1013
01:07:15,596 --> 01:07:17,119
so let me call Noah.

1014
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:19,425
If he's talking to me, then
he's not thinking about you.

1015
01:07:19,426 --> 01:07:20,513
That's cool.

1016
01:07:20,514 --> 01:07:21,907
Train wreck crew.

1017
01:07:22,212 --> 01:07:24,126
Train wreck crew.

1018
01:07:24,127 --> 01:07:28,566
I wish to confess
to the profound misdeeds...

1019
01:07:29,436 --> 01:07:31,176
...that I
and my brother Geoffrey

1020
01:07:31,177 --> 01:07:34,876
presided over as CEOs of Agnian.

1021
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:37,617
- Miss me, Claire?
- Well, I've been thinking.

1022
01:07:37,618 --> 01:07:40,316
You know what you
remind me of, Noah?

1023
01:07:40,317 --> 01:07:44,146
One of those wasps. I don't know
their name. You probably do.

1024
01:07:44,147 --> 01:07:46,061
They lay their eggs
in moth larvae

1025
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:48,194
and then they take
over from within.

1026
01:07:48,629 --> 01:07:51,328
- Ichneumon wasps?
- Ichneumon wasps.

1027
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,678
Marcus Blake, he was the moth.

1028
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,201
You killed
everything Earth Revolution was.

1029
01:07:56,202 --> 01:07:59,248
You perverted everything
that Blake was fighting for.

1030
01:07:59,249 --> 01:08:00,946
You called me
just to tell me that?

1031
01:08:01,381 --> 01:08:03,513
Those hostages,
they must be close to waking up.

1032
01:08:03,514 --> 01:08:06,081
I think it's time we agreed
the best way they can walk out.

1033
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:08,083
In 40 minutes,
we'll walk out with them

1034
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:09,388
onto the coaches that
you are going

1035
01:08:09,389 --> 01:08:10,520
to allow through
the perimeter.

1036
01:08:10,521 --> 01:08:11,825
At which point,

1037
01:08:11,826 --> 01:08:13,740
we will drive 300 metres,
up St. Thomas Street,

1038
01:08:13,741 --> 01:08:16,874
where, provided you behave,
we'll release half the hostages.

1039
01:08:16,875 --> 01:08:18,136
Then?

1040
01:08:18,137 --> 01:08:19,703
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves, now.

1041
01:08:19,704 --> 01:08:21,967
I need assurances
you'll release all of them.

1042
01:08:22,446 --> 01:08:25,274
We will, once we're well clear
of here and the truth is out.

1043
01:08:25,275 --> 01:08:27,276
Any attempts
to get clever will result

1044
01:08:27,277 --> 01:08:29,931
in more bad headlines
and dead bodies.

1045
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:33,979
In the following cases,
such as that of Elena Lanza,

1046
01:08:34,762 --> 01:08:39,419
contract killings were tacitly
but knowingly encouraged.

1047
01:08:40,594 --> 01:08:42,074
We are guilty.

1048
01:08:43,031 --> 01:08:45,469
And that's a fucking wrap.

1049
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,437
Joey, we're running out of time.

1050
01:09:23,463 --> 01:09:25,595
Oh, my God.

1051
01:09:25,596 --> 01:09:28,381
- Are you okay?
- No, not okay.

1052
01:09:28,642 --> 01:09:29,903
I'm quite stressed.

1053
01:09:29,904 --> 01:09:33,081
Squeeze.

1054
01:09:33,299 --> 01:09:36,475
- Can I get up first?
- Yes. Good idea.

1055
01:09:36,476 --> 01:09:39,262
There's some
crazy stuff going on.

1056
01:09:48,358 --> 01:09:50,228
Hume, I'm in. I'm inside.

1057
01:09:50,229 --> 01:09:53,100
Well done. Now get moving.
They'll be coming for you.

1058
01:10:05,331 --> 01:10:08,987
- She's alive. She's inside.
- Then fucking find her.

1059
01:10:14,862 --> 01:10:18,474
- Come on, come on. Come on.
- What about the hostages?

1060
01:10:18,475 --> 01:10:21,651
- We're not gonna let them die.
- What about us?

1061
01:10:21,652 --> 01:10:26,222
- We're not gonna die either.
- What if we do?

1062
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:28,789
Michael.

1063
01:10:29,399 --> 01:10:31,096
Michael, we have to go.

1064
01:10:31,792 --> 01:10:34,490
- I'm scared, Joanna.
- I'm scared too.

1065
01:10:34,491 --> 01:10:37,581
But we can't stop,
not here, not now.

1066
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:40,148
Michael. Michael.

1067
01:10:41,106 --> 01:10:43,586
- I need you.
- You need me?

1068
01:10:43,587 --> 01:10:46,633
Noah's after some files.
I need you to hack them.

1069
01:10:48,809 --> 01:10:51,202
Remember when the Avengers
steal the Infinity Stones?

1070
01:10:51,203 --> 01:10:53,160
Yes, they had
to build a time machine.

1071
01:10:53,161 --> 01:10:54,684
Forget the time machine.

1072
01:10:54,685 --> 01:10:55,902
They steal the stones.

1073
01:10:55,903 --> 01:10:57,818
Thanos goes crazy trying
to get them back.

1074
01:10:58,689 --> 01:11:01,518
We're gonna steal
Noah's Infinity Stones.

1075
01:11:03,302 --> 01:11:06,522
- Just checking. You mean...
- The files.

1076
01:11:06,523 --> 01:11:08,264
I mean the files.

1077
01:11:09,569 --> 01:11:11,005
Okay, come on.

1078
01:11:11,484 --> 01:11:13,093
I told you what would happen
if you tried to interfere,

1079
01:11:13,094 --> 01:11:14,094
didn't I, Claire?

1080
01:11:14,095 --> 01:11:15,661
My teams haven't moved, Noah,

1081
01:11:15,662 --> 01:11:17,054
so if there's trouble on
the inside,

1082
01:11:17,055 --> 01:11:18,621
then it's outside
both our control.

1083
01:11:18,622 --> 01:11:21,188
You know ichneumon wasps,
they have another name.

1084
01:11:21,189 --> 01:11:22,886
They're a, they're
called Darwin wasps.

1085
01:11:22,887 --> 01:11:25,236
See, Darwin thought
that a creature surviving

1086
01:11:25,237 --> 01:11:26,542
through the
destruction of another

1087
01:11:26,543 --> 01:11:29,284
was proof against
the existence of God,

1088
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:31,591
as if man wasn't proof enough.

1089
01:11:39,469 --> 01:11:41,297
But soon I'll have
the truth and so will you.

1090
01:11:41,906 --> 01:11:42,906
Bye Claire.

1091
01:11:46,476 --> 01:11:47,825
Did he just blink?

1092
01:11:52,438 --> 01:11:55,354
Man has no
preordained right to exist.

1093
01:11:56,007 --> 01:11:58,008
In fact, I'd argue that
we had our chance to exist

1094
01:11:58,009 --> 01:12:00,445
in balance with nature
and everything around us

1095
01:12:00,446 --> 01:12:02,056
and we set it all on fire.

1096
01:12:02,796 --> 01:12:06,973
No, I don't think he did.
He's gonna kill them all.

1097
01:12:24,296 --> 01:12:25,776
Quick.

1098
01:12:36,656 --> 01:12:38,048
If we get out of this,

1099
01:12:38,049 --> 01:12:40,616
can we do something together,
like a, like a joust?

1100
01:12:40,617 --> 01:12:42,793
Well, no, not a joust.
I can't ride a horse.

1101
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:47,275
We could go snorkelling.

1102
01:12:49,930 --> 01:12:51,541
I don't like it here.

1103
01:12:52,324 --> 01:12:54,370
Yeah. Neither will they.

1104
01:13:09,341 --> 01:13:10,777
Stay here.

1105
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:04,483
Put it down.

1106
01:14:59,712 --> 01:15:00,974
Joey!

1107
01:15:19,471 --> 01:15:21,428
So well, what now, great leader?

1108
01:15:21,429 --> 01:15:23,126
We show the world why we came.

1109
01:15:23,127 --> 01:15:25,258
Only one more confession
coming after Gerald's.

1110
01:15:25,259 --> 01:15:27,304
I need four minutes to encrypt,
then it's showtime.

1111
01:15:27,305 --> 01:15:30,003
Socials, news. There
won't be a feed it doesn't hit.

1112
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:32,527
I hope it's worth it,

1113
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:34,137
because so far the entire world

1114
01:15:34,138 --> 01:15:36,096
thinks you're a terrorist
whack job.

1115
01:15:36,488 --> 01:15:37,837
You'll see.

1116
01:15:38,621 --> 01:15:40,231
They'll all see.

1117
01:15:56,943 --> 01:15:59,249
My name is Noah Santos,
and by the time you see this,

1118
01:15:59,250 --> 01:16:01,992
myself and everyone in
this building will be dead.

1119
01:16:02,383 --> 01:16:03,470
What?

1120
01:16:03,471 --> 01:16:04,820
You'll have seen
the truth by now.

1121
01:16:04,821 --> 01:16:06,822
Agnian are guilty, like the
countless other

1122
01:16:06,823 --> 01:16:08,651
corporations that
plunder our planet.

1123
01:16:09,434 --> 01:16:10,956
I give you this truth

1124
01:16:10,957 --> 01:16:13,306
because you need to know
when they're counting the bodies

1125
01:16:13,307 --> 01:16:15,092
that my cause was just.

1126
01:16:15,875 --> 01:16:19,704
Man is a plague upon the Earth,
a virus.

1127
01:16:19,705 --> 01:16:21,793
- What the fuck is this?
- There is no more destructive,

1128
01:16:21,794 --> 01:16:23,578
rapacious filth...

1129
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:26,058
I told you, true believers only.

1130
01:16:26,059 --> 01:16:28,888
Yeah, I truly believe
you're a fucking psycho.

1131
01:16:45,949 --> 01:16:47,733
Come on.

1132
01:16:48,734 --> 01:16:50,561
NOAH [On video]: ...the
building will be dead.

1133
01:16:50,562 --> 01:16:52,215
You'll have seen
the truth now...

1134
01:16:52,216 --> 01:16:54,957
Don't look at them.
Just do your thing. Michael.

1135
01:16:54,958 --> 01:16:57,220
...As is
everyone who enables them.

1136
01:16:57,221 --> 01:17:00,919
Insanity,
true insanity in this context,

1137
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:03,400
would be watching the Earth
die beneath our very feet

1138
01:17:03,401 --> 01:17:05,229
while we do nothing about it.

1139
01:17:05,708 --> 01:17:08,361
I don't understand.
It's the truth.

1140
01:17:08,362 --> 01:17:11,364
For the earth to heal, the human
virus must be controlled.

1141
01:17:11,365 --> 01:17:13,192
I know it is,
but what about that?

1142
01:17:13,193 --> 01:17:16,195
Because there is no new dawn,
not with man in it.

1143
01:17:16,196 --> 01:17:19,546
Our extinction is inevitable,
deserved and necessary.

1144
01:17:19,547 --> 01:17:22,245
Yes, okay, that's bad.

1145
01:17:22,246 --> 01:17:24,116
We mustn't fear this.

1146
01:17:24,117 --> 01:17:26,031
So now we punish.

1147
01:17:26,032 --> 01:17:29,731
This is war, and there
will be no mercy, no quarter.

1148
01:17:29,732 --> 01:17:31,994
All flesh is just grass,

1149
01:17:31,995 --> 01:17:34,736
and with the harvest reaped,
the earth can renew.

1150
01:17:34,737 --> 01:17:38,914
- Come on, come on.
- Joanna, please, don't rush me.

1151
01:17:38,915 --> 01:17:41,090
...each and every one
of my brothers and sisters

1152
01:17:41,091 --> 01:17:43,527
to take up my crusade.

1153
01:17:43,528 --> 01:17:45,921
Let the blood
of the guilty spill,

1154
01:17:45,922 --> 01:17:49,447
light the fires around
them and burn it all down.

1155
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:52,624
NOAH [On radio]:
I need an update, Zee.

1156
01:17:55,148 --> 01:17:57,149
The update is
your plan's fucked.

1157
01:17:57,150 --> 01:18:00,283
I've got the evidence and your
weird angry-man YouTube rant.

1158
01:18:00,284 --> 01:18:02,198
It doesn't matter how
many people you kill, Noah,

1159
01:18:02,199 --> 01:18:03,808
no one will ever know why.

1160
01:18:03,809 --> 01:18:06,682
You're just another
psycho the world will hate.

1161
01:18:08,945 --> 01:18:12,731
- You're such a badass.
- So are you. Come on.

1162
01:18:15,125 --> 01:18:16,647
Hume, he's going
to blow the building.

1163
01:18:16,648 --> 01:18:17,692
He's going to kill everyone.

1164
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:19,781
We know. We're coming in

1165
01:18:19,782 --> 01:18:21,826
- and you need to get out now.
- No.

1166
01:18:21,827 --> 01:18:23,654
I've got what he wants.
He'll come after me.

1167
01:18:23,655 --> 01:18:24,786
I'll deal with that switch.

1168
01:18:24,787 --> 01:18:26,309
You get as many people
out as you can.

1169
01:18:26,310 --> 01:18:28,659
The control room is empty.
They won't see you coming.

1170
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:31,053
I'm sending my brother
down in the service lift.

1171
01:18:31,054 --> 01:18:33,011
- Get him clear of here.
- Copy that.

1172
01:18:33,012 --> 01:18:34,448
Hume, listen.

1173
01:18:34,797 --> 01:18:38,539
I need you to take care of him.
It's a numbers game, right?

1174
01:18:39,671 --> 01:18:41,151
Copy that, Joey. I will.

1175
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:43,240
Good luck.

1176
01:18:44,415 --> 01:18:45,371
They're going to look after you.

1177
01:18:45,372 --> 01:18:46,764
You're going to be okay,
I promise.

1178
01:18:46,765 --> 01:18:48,984
- But you have to go.
- No, wait. What about you?

1179
01:18:48,985 --> 01:18:51,377
As long as Noah's chasing me,
they can save more people...

1180
01:18:51,378 --> 01:18:53,075
- No.
- and you can get out.

1181
01:18:53,076 --> 01:18:55,817
- No, but you need me.
- I'll be right behind you.

1182
01:18:55,818 --> 01:18:58,211
- I need you.
- You don't.

1183
01:18:58,908 --> 01:19:01,605
You were right, I was
never there for you. I wasn't.

1184
01:19:01,606 --> 01:19:03,259
- No, please.
- I wasn't, and I'm sorry.

1185
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:05,348
- No.
- You were right.

1186
01:19:05,349 --> 01:19:07,307
- No.
- It was always later.

1187
01:19:08,134 --> 01:19:10,701
This time I'm not
gonna let you down.

1188
01:19:14,010 --> 01:19:15,098
Michael, please.

1189
01:19:17,927 --> 01:19:19,015
Please.

1190
01:19:41,211 --> 01:19:44,082
Bastard! You
said you'd let us go!

1191
01:19:44,083 --> 01:19:46,694
I said we were all
going out the same way.

1192
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,746
- Where are you, Joey?
- Utility.

1193
01:19:55,747 --> 01:19:57,269
See if you can do
better than the last

1194
01:19:57,270 --> 01:19:59,576
three arseholes
you sent.

1195
01:20:13,460 --> 01:20:15,766
CLAIRE [On radio]: We get
one chance. We get in there,

1196
01:20:15,767 --> 01:20:17,986
get as many hostages
as you can and get out.

1197
01:20:17,987 --> 01:20:20,031
Do not kill Noah Santos. Repeat:

1198
01:20:20,032 --> 01:20:23,862
Do not kill Noah Santos.
If his pulse stops, it's over.

1199
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:56,999
Everyone stay calm and still.

1200
01:22:02,395 --> 01:22:04,614
Ma'am,
we don't have time

1201
01:22:04,615 --> 01:22:06,485
to disarm this many devices,

1202
01:22:06,486 --> 01:22:08,226
not this complex.

1203
01:22:08,227 --> 01:22:10,098
If even one of them detonates,

1204
01:22:10,099 --> 01:22:12,840
it's gonna bring
down the whole building.

1205
01:22:46,309 --> 01:22:47,745
Hey, Joey.

1206
01:22:49,094 --> 01:22:51,096
I really wish you
could see what I see.

1207
01:22:51,836 --> 01:22:53,489
A world with nobody.

1208
01:22:53,490 --> 01:22:55,013
It's beautiful.

1209
01:22:57,363 --> 01:22:59,321
Do you still
wanna end me? Go ahead.

1210
01:22:59,322 --> 01:23:01,063
Look. I'll make it easy for you.

1211
01:23:03,761 --> 01:23:05,241
Come on, do it.

1212
01:23:06,198 --> 01:23:10,114
Do it. Do it,
Joey. Just fucking do it!

1213
01:23:23,607 --> 01:23:25,042
Nice, Joey.

1214
01:23:25,043 --> 01:23:26,652
Finally putting other people's
interests above your own.

1215
01:23:26,653 --> 01:23:29,481
Shame, though, it's the wrong
people. Now give me the drive.

1216
01:23:29,482 --> 01:23:31,962
Do you think I'd be dumb enough
to keep it on me? Fuck you!

1217
01:23:31,963 --> 01:23:33,311
- Where the fuck is it?
- It's gone.

1218
01:23:33,312 --> 01:23:34,922
No one will ever
know why you did this.

1219
01:23:35,314 --> 01:23:37,228
I guess they'll just
have to figure it out, then.

1220
01:23:37,229 --> 01:23:38,535
No!

1221
01:24:01,993 --> 01:24:03,429
Ready.

1222
01:24:22,187 --> 01:24:25,582
All flesh is grass.
I guess you lose.

1223
01:24:27,497 --> 01:24:29,064
Yeah.

1224
01:24:31,544 --> 01:24:32,545
No.

1225
01:24:38,595 --> 01:24:39,683
Later, Noah

1226
01:25:31,604 --> 01:25:33,084
Joey.

1227
01:25:35,478 --> 01:25:36,783
Train wreck crew.

1228
01:25:37,523 --> 01:25:39,134
Train wreck crew.

1229
01:25:39,351 --> 01:25:41,571
- Michael?
- Safe.

1230
01:25:42,833 --> 01:25:46,184
- You did a good job up there.
- Beats cleaning windows.

1231
01:25:48,273 --> 01:25:50,927
Right, there'll be more
debriefs. Go get some rest.

1232
01:25:50,928 --> 01:25:55,714
Debriefs can come later.
And the evidence that you took.

1233
01:25:55,715 --> 01:25:58,282
The higher-ups are
insisting you hand it over,

1234
01:25:58,283 --> 01:26:00,328
just so that this
can all get processed

1235
01:26:00,329 --> 01:26:01,721
through the correct channels.

1236
01:26:02,722 --> 01:26:04,897
It would be
a shame if after all that,

1237
01:26:04,898 --> 01:26:08,032
all those dirty little secrets
stayed buried, wouldn't it?

1238
01:26:08,989 --> 01:26:10,120
Yeah, it would.

1239
01:26:10,121 --> 01:26:11,121
Hmm.

1240
01:26:11,122 --> 01:26:13,906
We don't have it. We never did.

1241
01:26:13,907 --> 01:26:15,430
I was bluffing
to make Noah bite.

1242
01:26:15,431 --> 01:26:18,434
That's what I thought. Smart.

1243
01:26:22,525 --> 01:26:24,831
You did a good
thing tonight, Joey.

1244
01:26:25,484 --> 01:26:26,746
Don't stop now.

1245
01:26:27,530 --> 01:26:30,446
- The 33 million...
- That you have to give back.

1246
01:26:44,851 --> 01:26:46,375
Do you need a squeeze?

1247
01:27:08,005 --> 01:27:09,398
Got the drive?

1248
01:27:11,574 --> 01:27:13,271
I have the drive.

1249
01:27:20,887 --> 01:27:23,237
They're calling
it the "Earth Revolution leaks".

1250
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:24,586
Following the death of

1251
01:27:24,587 --> 01:27:26,849
anti-humanist
terrorist Noah Santos,

1252
01:27:26,850 --> 01:27:28,981
the anonymous
leaks have lifted the lid

1253
01:27:28,982 --> 01:27:30,635
on a tsunami of corruption

1254
01:27:30,636 --> 01:27:32,724
at the highest levels
of the energy industry.

1255
01:27:37,861 --> 01:27:39,383
One question remains:

1256
01:27:39,384 --> 01:27:41,255
will the ripples of this scandal

1257
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:43,431
change the course
of the climate crisis,

1258
01:27:43,432 --> 01:27:45,564
or will it be business as usual?

1259
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:51,395
This is nice.

1260
01:27:51,396 --> 01:27:53,223
Really nice.

1261
01:27:53,224 --> 01:27:55,443
Do you
think they'll go to jail?

1262
01:27:55,444 --> 01:27:57,358
I hope so.

1263
01:27:57,359 --> 01:28:00,230
- I think they will.
- Maybe.

1264
01:28:00,231 --> 01:28:02,320
Piers Morgan,
eat your heart out.

1265
01:28:04,975 --> 01:28:06,498
Yeah.

1266
01:28:07,325 --> 01:28:10,196
- You okay?
- I'm better than okay.

1267
01:28:10,197 --> 01:28:12,111
- It's just...
- What?

1268
01:28:12,112 --> 01:28:13,548
Something's
been bugging me since the tower.

1269
01:28:13,549 --> 01:28:14,766
Okay.

1270
01:28:14,767 --> 01:28:17,029
Okay, Thanos didn't
just hunt down

1271
01:28:17,030 --> 01:28:19,249
the Avengers' Infinity Stones.

1272
01:28:19,250 --> 01:28:21,251
I don't think that's
doing the Russo brothers,

1273
01:28:21,252 --> 01:28:23,209
Kevin Feige or Endgamejustice.

1274
01:28:23,210 --> 01:28:24,863
That's been bugging you?

1275
01:28:24,864 --> 01:28:27,344
Look, I just
feel like you simplified it.

1276
01:28:27,345 --> 01:28:29,346
Mmm...
We were in an armed siege.

1277
01:28:29,347 --> 01:28:32,218
