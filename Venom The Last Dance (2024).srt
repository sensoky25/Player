1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000

3
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:55,471
I am Knull.

4
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,347
God of the void.

5
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,852
Slicer of worlds.

6
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:02,102
<i>Long ago,</i>

7
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:05,063
<i>when light invaded my kingdom,</i>

8
00:01:05,064 --> 00:01:08,319
<i>my symbiote children betrayed me</i>

9
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,530
<i>and imprisoned me here.</i>

10
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:19,453
At last,
a codex has been created.

11
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:22,748
It is the key to my freedom.

12
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,878
It will unlock this prison.

13
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:30,255
I order you to search
the corners of the universe

14
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,592
until you find this key.

15
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:36,931
Find me the codex.

16
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:45,562
And when I escape,

17
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,940
and annihilate
every living planet

18
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:52,071
and destroy
my symbiote offspring,

19
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:54,281
I will reward you...

20
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,575
with your lives.

21
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:34,820
<i>So you're saying
in this universe,</i>

22
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,740
<i>there's these superhero people.</i>

23
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:37,950
All right.

24
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:41,910
So tell me again
about your purple alien friend

25
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,956
who really loves stones.

26
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,874
'Cause I'll tell you what, man,

27
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:50,377
aliens, they do not love stones.

28
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:51,670
- <i>Eddie, don't start.</i>
- No.

29
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,133
No, they do not love stones.

30
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,051
Do you know what they love?

31
00:02:57,136 --> 00:02:59,138
They love eating brains!

32
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,056
Because that's what they do.

33
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:05,392
<i>Señor,</i> he made
my family disappear.

34
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,604
For five years.

35
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:10,858
Five years, huh?

36
00:03:12,735 --> 00:03:14,194
Well, that is a long time.

37
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:16,822
All right.

38
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,032
<i>Eddie!</i>

39
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,326
<i>We are drunk!</i>

40
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,255
<i>We're home!</i>

41
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,259
<i>I'm so done
with the multi-verse shit.</i>

42
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,970
<i>And I like our version
of the barman better.</i>

43
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:42,638
Ow. My head hurts.

44
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,139
I feel like I'm drunk,

45
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,560
but I'm also hungover
at the same time.

46
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,812
<i>Eddie!
You want a Bloody María.</i>

47
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,481
<i>Oh yeah!</i>

48
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,069
- No.
- I don't want a drink.

49
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:02,117
Stop! You are destroying
this man's bar!

50
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,875
<i>Tequila!</i>

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,628
<i>I'm having the time
of my life, Eddie!</i>

52
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,462
I'd rather have
a glass of water.

53
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:16,882
<i>Be a man, Eddie.</i>

54
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:21,053
<i>We should've been a bartender!</i>

55
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,017
<i>- Tequila!</i>
- I did it.

56
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,143
I <i>did it.</i>

57
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:33,190
What the hell were those things?

58
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:35,901
I was born with them.

59
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:40,197
Freaking bar!
I'm done with this shit!

60
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:45,659
<i>This is Kelly Roulet
reporting from San Francisco.</i>

61
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,078
<i>Police are still
trying to locate</i>

62
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,788
<i>former reporter
Eddie Brock for questioning...</i>

63
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,083
Oh no.

64
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,128
<i>...after the tragic death
of Detective Patrick Mulligan.</i>

65
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:55,337
No.

66
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,587
<i>Detective Mulligan
was found impaled</i>

67
00:04:57,588 --> 00:05:00,173
<i>amidst a series
of bizarre happenings</i>

68
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,677
<i>at the city's cathedral.</i>

69
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,387
They think that <i>I</i> killed him.

70
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,512
{\an8}<i>How long can he
evade authorities?</i>

71
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,016
{\an8}<i>Only time will tell.</i>

72
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:09,433
<i>If we are
on the news here,</i>

73
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:12,438
<i>we are on the news everywhere.</i>

74
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:15,814
Well, we can't go back
to San Francisco.

75
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,357
And I'm not staying down here,

76
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:20,152
hiding for the rest of my life
in Mexico, that's for sure.

77
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,445
<i>Where will we go?</i>

78
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,365
I don't know. I don't know.

79
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,537
Ooh.

80
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,498
That could work. Hey.

81
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:32,748
This judge got me

82
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,666
- kicked out of New York.
- <i>What a dick!</i>

83
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,377
Yeah, I still got a ton
of shit on him too.

84
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:40,922
<i>I've always wanted
to see the Statue of Liberty.</i>

85
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:43,177
Maybe we could blackmail him.

86
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:46,303
And clear my name.

87
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,389
<i>Let's go!</i>

88
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:50,684
<i>- Road trip!</i>
- Let's get the hell out of here.

89
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,395
<i>Keep the change!</i>

90
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:02,029
We keep our heads down,
and we keep moving.

91
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:06,907
<i>We are fugitives!</i>

92
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,453
<i>We are on the run!</i>

93
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:12,245
<i>Yes, we are innocent. Yes.</i>

94
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:16,500
<i>But I will eat every bad guy
that gets in our way.</i>

95
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,337
I need a Tylenol.

96
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,725
Do you hear that?

97
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,279
<i>Someone's in trouble.</i>

98
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,323
<i>And I need fuel for the road.</i>

99
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:49,409
Yeah, okay.

100
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,890
<i>That way.</i>

101
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:24,194
<i>Bad men, Eddie.</i>

102
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:29,032
<i>Are we the Lethal Protector,
or not?</i>

103
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,578
Do your thing.

104
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,747
<i>Easy-peasy.</i>

105
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:53,515
Jesus.

106
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:02,439
<i>Cute!</i>

107
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,234
<i>I promise not to eat it.</i>

108
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,111
They're fighting dogs.

109
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:11,200
<i>I draw the line
at fighting dogs, pal.</i>

110
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:20,417
<i>Oye, vato,</i>
you're in the wrong place.

111
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,961
Oh, hello.

112
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,546
This is our territory.

113
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:27,507
Well, I assume

114
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:29,341
by the threatening look
on your faces

115
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,262
that I oughta be scared, right?

116
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:37,891
But you took
the wrong path, <i>hermano.</i>

117
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,353
We can't let you leave.

118
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,520
I have a headache

119
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:46,191
on account of the fact
that I was drinking a lot.

120
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,277
I'm gonna be honest.

121
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:51,738
I have a really dark
and unpredictable side to me.

122
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,492
We all have monsters inside us.

123
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:55,367
Not like this.

124
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,955
So dark that it is highly likely

125
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,373
to tear your head off
and feed it

126
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,542
to your asshole.

127
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:04,417
<i>Or me!
You can feed it to me!</i>

128
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,963
Yeah, or I can feed it to him.

129
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:09,756
All right. Look. Whoa, whoa.
Come on. I got a suggestion.

130
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,049
No. Stop speaking.

131
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,134
I'm not gonna stop speaking.
This is for you.

132
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,389
I'm doing this
for your benefit, all right?

133
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:17,891
I don't have to. Okay?
So pay attention.

134
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:20,060
We're gonna find all of these
dogs loving forever homes

135
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,521
because what you're doing
is reprehensible.

136
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:25,313
What does your mother
think of you, man?

137
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,315
My mother's dead, <i>culero.</i>

138
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,694
<i>You made it awkward!</i>

139
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:30,362
I'm sorry to hear that.

140
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,739
Huh?

141
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,413
I'm giving you a chance.

142
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,790
Sweetie, I really am
giving you a chance.

143
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,168
You should probably take it.

144
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,302
<i>Say when.</i>

145
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:54,720
When.

146
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:06,188
<i>Hola,</i> bitches.

147
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:29,546
Oh!

148
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,008
Who's a bad boy?

149
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,100
Now that's
some sturdy footwear!

150
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,355
Where you going?

151
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,191
Home.

152
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:50,359
Nah.

153
00:10:58,909 --> 00:10:59,993
What...

154
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:02,079
are you?

155
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:05,747
We are...

156
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,415
We are Venom!

157
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,084
We are...

158
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,794
- Venom!
- No!

159
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,212
- Oh!
- Yeah.

160
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,421
- We...
- We...

161
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:16,259
are Venom.

162
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:18,095
What?

163
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:22,182
We are totally gonna
need to work on that.

164
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:33,110
<i>That was delicious!</i>

165
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:34,943
You're welcome.

166
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,488
Thank you.

167
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:39,280
<i>You take me
to all the finest places!</i>

168
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,116
Let's get the hell out of here.

169
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,494
Where's my shoe?

170
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:44,828
Oh, hey, buddy!

171
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,124
That's my shoe!
That's my shoe. That's my shoe!

172
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:48,792
Give me my shoe.

173
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,259
<i>These will fit.</i>

174
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,219
Now we are on the run

175
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,219
for something
we actually did do.

176
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,805
And I got stuck with a superhero
who can't fly.

177
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:04,891
<i>Wanna bet?</i>

178
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,085
There you are.

179
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,048
Get me General Strickland.

180
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:57,903
What the...?

181
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:07,871
Viral shedding.

182
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,832
These things wanna live.

183
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,093
Tell me about the man
who was just here.

184
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,893
He was acting, like, crazy.
Talking to himself.

185
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:32,062
What was he saying?

186
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:38,399
He had these big,
massive, wild arms.

187
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,861
They were bobbling like this.

188
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:43,365
Bring him.

189
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,384
<i>You think there are
another brother and sister</i>

190
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,637
<i>on one of those stars...</i>

191
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:09,057
looking at the same sky?

192
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,016
I'll be able to tell you
one day.

193
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:16,604
My twin brother...

194
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,567
a future NASA scientist.

195
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,111
One day.

196
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:26,908
When thunder roars,
head indoors.

197
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:45,719
No!

198
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,377
<i>He's on life support.</i>

199
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,796
<i>Get him
to emergency symbiosis now.</i>

200
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:36,603
It should be you.

201
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,355
<i>This just came across
our news desk</i>

202
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,439
<i>and it bears repeating:</i>

203
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,942
<i>For all of you alien enthusiasts
out there, it's a sad day.</i>

204
00:15:44,943 --> 00:15:48,946
<i>Washington has finally announced
the decommissioning of Area 51.</i>

205
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:50,657
<i>The controversial site is famous</i>

206
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,992
<i>for its alleged testing
on aliens.</i>

207
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,454
<i>In other news today...</i>

208
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:10,387
Right this way. Come on up.

209
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:26,818
Strickland.

210
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,530
<i>Strickland authorized.</i>

211
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:46,089
- It's finally happening, then.
- Yeah.

212
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:50,135
Yes, ma'am. Be nothing left
but rock and dust.

213
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,884
And roaches.

214
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:54,303
Even the biggest of bangs
couldn't kill 'em.

215
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:57,515
They've been around 280 million
years. And counting.

216
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,893
I did not know that, Dr. Paine.

217
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:07,275
Good to go.

218
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,903
- Have a good one, Gus.
- You too.

219
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,064
- Thank you.
- Yes, ma'am.

220
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:53,279
Morning, Dr. Paine,
we'll keep 'em safe for you.

221
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,200
I still don't think anyone
wants my old beater, Jim.

222
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:56,993
Never judge a book by its cover.

223
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:04,165
Early morning wake-up,
General Strickland.

224
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,584
Looks like
all your dreams came true.

225
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,838
I know how that must bug you.

226
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:12,048
He arrived shortly
before you did.

227
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,883
Did our new friend
give him any trouble?

228
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,718
You see,
that's exactly the problem.

229
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:16,803
What?

230
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,348
Your assumption
we're meeting friends.

231
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,101
- Morning.
- Good morning.

232
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,685
The bonding was successful.

233
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:25,897
I heard.

234
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:32,193
You always have this
look on your face

235
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,613
like something terrible
is imminent.

236
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:34,821
Because in my line of work

237
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,989
something terrible
<i>is</i> always imminent.

238
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,494
We contain them, you study them.

239
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,079
It's how it works.

240
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,502
Let's have a look.

241
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,337
- Hello, doctor.
- Morning.

242
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,591
His other symbiote
left him for dead.

243
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,303
<i>We saved him.</i>

244
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:58,555
He would have died.

245
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:03,434
Oh, try lowering those levels.

246
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:11,693
Morning, Sadie.

247
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,152
Let me get that.

248
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:14,902
We got this down in Mexico.

249
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:17,198
Hi. Welcome.

250
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:19,868
Any more on
where the rest of him is?

251
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,412
- We're gettin' there.
- Update me as you have it.

252
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,289
I don't get this obsession.

253
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,710
I told you.
My mom made me this pin.

254
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:29,878
It's July.

255
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:32,547
- I'll see you in there.
- Mm-mm.

256
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:35,466
Everyone on this side...

257
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,175
is weird.

258
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:39,719
Leave her alone, Rex.

259
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,807
God forbid anyone should
actually enjoy their work.

260
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:59,030
Area 51 will be
fully decommissioned

261
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,364
by the end of the week.

262
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,908
It's just a shipwreck anyway,

263
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,745
and they're tired
of the tourists.

264
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,162
But we don't exist down here.

265
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,624
A hundred feet subsurface...

266
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:10,251
undetectable to any human...

267
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:12,420
or nonhuman.

268
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,879
No one's phoning home from here.

269
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,339
My brother's greatest ambition

270
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,260
was to work up there at 51
doing what I do.

271
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:21,510
And I wish
I could have shown him

272
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:22,764
what we've built down here.

273
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:28,227
<i>You're okay.</i>

274
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:29,979
<i>Just...</i>

275
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:33,358
<i>try to breathe. Okay?</i>

276
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,442
When my brother
and I were kids

277
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:39,948
they told us that UFOs were just
weather balloons, space trash.

278
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:43,242
Kubrick directed the moon
landing in a Hollywood studio.

279
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,451
Cool story.

280
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,538
Where are you going? This first.

281
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:49,332
Is there an increased risk
of exposure?

282
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,500
It's not us I'm worried about.

283
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:55,044
You know we carry all kinds
of viruses and bacteria

284
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,756
that could be harmful
to a sensitive lifeform.

285
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:59,425
And we don't know exactly
what we're dealing with here.

286
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:01,719
As long as we're keeping
the guests safe.

287
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:10,395
This is the first time
we've had a host

288
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,852
compatible with
one of our symbiotes.

289
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,856
And now we'll be able
to talk to one.

290
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:17,193
<i>Monsters.</i>

291
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,545
He's been experiencing panic
surges since we bonded him.

292
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,464
You try "Jingle Bells"?
So soothing.

293
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,675
Wow, why didn't <i>I</i> think of that?

294
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,012
Release him.

295
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:49,726
<i>Monsters.</i>

296
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:54,939

You're safe here.

298
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,110
We're gonna help you.

299
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:01,654
Both of you.

300
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,658
The transfer was successful.

301
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:08,077
We had no choice.

302
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:09,787
We had to try and save you.

303
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:18,629

304
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:27,930

<i>May I...?</i>

306
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,696
<i>May I ask you some questions?</i>

307
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:51,412
Is the symbiote
communicating with you?

308
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:55,248
<i>Do you hear it?</i>

309
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,129
Sound distresses them.

310
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:03,883
<i>Okay.</i>

311
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:09,597
<i>- Why are they here?
- What do they want?</i>

312
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:10,890
<i>Safe haven.</i>

313
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:12,600
<i>Safe haven?</i>

314
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,352
<i>We were running.</i>

315
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,644
<i>Is he talking
about the other symbiotes?</i>

316
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,147
<i>I think so.</i>

317
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:22,443
His creatures
search the universe for us.

318
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:24,904
<i>But we will be found.</i>

319
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:30,451
<i>And when we are,
he will kill us all.</i>

320
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:33,663
Who?

321
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:35,957
<i>There will be nothing left.</i>

322
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,459
<i>Here? On Earth?</i>

323
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:43,297
Why were they running?

324
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:47,758

349

Why did you do that?

350

<i>will the Pentagon finally admit
that they've been holding UAPs?</i>

363
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:57,906
That's "unidentified aerial
phenomena" to you.

364
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:59,368
Yeah, Dad, we know.

365
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:02,121
What I wouldn't give to see
who built one of those things.

366
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:03,996
That's why we cashed in
our savings

367
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,958
and came on this
road trip, babe.

368
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:07,833
So you could finally
get to see--

369
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,001
That it's bullshit?

370
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,504
Yeah, well, what if I'm right?

371
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,171
Then I really hope
we don't end up

372
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,300
in an alien space lab
with probes up our asses.

373
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:16,344
Or dead.

374
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:17,677
"Asses."

375
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:23,476
- Whoa!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

376
00:27:27,772 --> 00:27:29,190
Kicked up some gravel there.

377
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:31,192
- Hang tight, family.
- You good?

378
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:33,194
That was wild!

379
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,862
- Did the dog vomit?
- Yeah.

380
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:49,377
<i>Okay!</i>

381
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:50,793
<i>We've got this.</i>

382
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,212
<i>Soft landing. Bend your knees.</i>

383
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,383
<i>Engage your core.
Engage your core!</i>

384
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:59,553
<i>Yes! Yes, that's it!
Yes. That's it!</i>

385
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,721
Whoa!

386
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,056
<i>Well done.</i>

387
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,684
That was terrifying.

388
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:09,353
Uh, this is not New York.

389
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,938
No, this is a wasteland.

390
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,773
<i>I'm detecting
passive aggression.</i>

391
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:13,857
- Are you?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

392
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,652
Oh, I'm sorry. How about
some <i>active</i> aggression?

393
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:19,696
You just threw me off a 757

394
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:21,824
without even
the slightest consideration

395
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,742
for my chronic vertigo.

396
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,619
It was an Airbus A320.

397
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,541
Was it? I am sorry. All right.

398
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:30,958
And what was that thing?

399
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,127
That thing
that we just juiced back there?

400
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,711
You're not going to like this.

401
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:37,590
No, I can absolutely guarantee
you that I'm not gonna.

402
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,176
What are you doing?
Why are you doing that?

403
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:43,178
That's er... You're being weird.
That's creepy.

404
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:45,013
That was a Xenophage.

405
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:46,098
A what?

406
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,852
A Xenophage.

407
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:49,977
- A symbiote hunter.
- Of course.

408
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,855
Problem is, if she has found
her way here,

409
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,483
others will soon follow.

410
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:55,732
"Others"?

411
00:28:55,733 --> 00:28:59,530
The Xenophage's maker
also created us symbiotes.

412
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:01,157
So that's your sister.

413
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:04,493
All the symbiotes turned on him,
locked him up on Klyntar.

414
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:05,703
- Your planet.
- No!

415
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:07,455
- Not a planet.
- Not your planet.

416
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,498
A prison we built for him
to sleep...

417
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:11,459
- Of course.
- ...for eternity!

418
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:13,210
What's his name, then?

419
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:16,336
I didn't hear a word you said.

420
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:17,463
Knull.

421
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:18,714
- Knull.
- No!

422
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,468
Shush, shush, shush, shush.

423
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,471
This is serious, Eddie.

424
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,806
Let's just not talk.

425
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:29,852
Quiet.

426
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:37,316
<i>What does this
Xyla-Xyn-Xyn-thingy,</i>

427
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,276
this symbiote hunter,
want with you anyway?

428
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:42,946
It doesn't. It wants us.
We have something it needs.

429
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:47,745
We only have this shitty shirt,
we got one boot and sunburn.

430
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,453
And the codex.

431
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,662
The what, now?

432
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,124
I'll show you.

433
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:55,876
Damn it, what are you doing?

434
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:59,046
<i>Let's say you died.
I could bring you back to life.</i>

435
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,214
<i>Well, I like that.</i>

436
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:03,091
<i>But if I did,
our separate life forces</i>

437
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:08,055
<i>would become one single force
called a codex.</i>

438
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,932
<i>What the hell is a codex?</i>

439
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:14,230
<i>It's a key.
A key that unlocks a cage.</i>

440
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:15,940
<i>The prison on Klyntar.</i>

441
00:30:16,065 --> 00:30:17,942
<i>It would
free our creator.</i>

442
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:19,650
Well, thank God we haven't died.

443
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,237
<i>Yeah,
except that one time.</i>

444
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:26,200
<i>Oh, no. No.</i>

445
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,450
<i>So you're telling me
we're carrying this thing.</i>

446
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:30,287
<i>That's why the Xenophage
is hunting us.</i>

447
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,579
<i>What do we do?</i>

448
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,164
<i>She can
only see the codex</i>

449
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,668
<i>when a symbiote
is in its full true form.</i>

450
00:30:39,964 --> 00:30:41,048
Right.

451
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:42,881
You mean you can't come out?

452
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:45,342
I can do this. I can do this.

453
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,678
But if I fully transform,

454
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,472
the codex sends her
a tracking signal.

455
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:53,308
She'll find us,
rip it out of our spine

456
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:55,060
and free Knull from Klyntar.

457
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,689
So how do we
get rid of this codex?

458
00:30:56,814 --> 00:31:01,692
As long as you and I both live,
the codex exists.

459
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,610
- If one of us should die...
- No.

460
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:04,736
...the codex would die.

461
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,699
- That's not gonna work for me.
- Nor me!

462
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,783
That Xenophage was fast.

463
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,618
It won't take long
for the feds to tie us

464
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:14,580
to those four headless bodies
we left in Mexico.

465
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,208
- We gotta get out of here.
- Yeah, we better go.

466
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:21,463
Ah!

467
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:24,174
<i>Four legs
are better than one.</i>

468
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,093
Be honest with me, buddy.

469
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:30,097
How fast do you think
you can get that thing to go?

470
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:31,597
Without killing it.

471
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:32,933
<i>Only one way to find out.</i>

472
00:31:34,268 --> 00:31:37,730
<i>Don't scare him.
Don't scare horsey-horsey-horse.</i>

473
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:41,732
<i>Nice horsey.</i>

474
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:42,941
Hey.

475
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,486
<i>Nice horsey.</i>

476
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,864
<i>Surprise, horsey!</i>

477
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:50,492
<i>I love horsey!</i>

478
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:54,912
Oh!

479
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:00,544
Let's go. Whoa!

480
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,047
<i>Yeehaw!</i>

481
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,386
<i>Ride me, cowboy!</i>

482
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,432
You are an asshole!

483
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:15,599
I swear to God,
when I get off this horse,

484
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,062
I'm gonna kick your ass,
you mother--

485
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:27,613
<i>Now that's horsepower!</i>

486
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:43,879
<i>Safe haven?</i>

487
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:46,924
No. They're not here
for a safe haven.

488
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,302
How about a new home?
Evict the current tenants.

489
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:53,597
I think you've watched too many
alien invasion movies, Rex.

490
00:32:56,517 --> 00:32:57,518
Have I?

491
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:06,235
They were running.
That's what he said.

492
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,028
Don't kid yourself.

493
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:09,780
They were always migrating.

494
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:12,406
<i>A meteor carrying symbiote life</i>

495
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:15,242
<i>crashes on Earth,
and they all survive.</i>

496
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,535
<i>Coincidence?</i>

497
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:17,871
<i>Give me a break.</i>

498
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:20,541
All right.

499
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:23,419
Let's go get 'em.

500
00:33:24,962 --> 00:33:26,420
You're so desperate to believe

501
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,424
that they're here
for altruistic reasons.

502
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,051
Makes you dangerous.

503
00:33:41,145 --> 00:33:43,230
We just intercepted
an emergency call

504
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,688
from an Airbus out of Mexico

505
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,192
saying a man jumped
off the plane over Sequoia.

506
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:49,153
We'll take the Osprey.

507
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:51,196
Eyes wide, Paine.

508
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:02,916
I can't feel my balls.

509
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:06,501
That...

510
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:07,880
That was horrible.

511
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:25,314
<i>Visual on suspect.</i>

512
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:29,568
Take him out.

513
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:33,238
- Collect the symbiote.
<i>- Team Six engaged.</i>

514
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:45,542
<i>Disengage harness. Let's go.</i>

515
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,880
Oh!

516
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:15,841
Oh.

517
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:22,137
<i>No! The codex!</i>

518
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,682
Can't let you die.

519
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,037
Where did that come from?

520
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,718
- <i>Morph!</i>
- Copy.

521
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:09,519
- <i>Time to go!</i>
- Hell yeah!

522
00:37:47,975 --> 00:37:49,099
What happened?

523
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,644
<i>There's something else out here.</i>

524
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,813
- Something else?
<i>- He said this would happen.</i>

525
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:54,564
I just lost three people.

526
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:56,233
Can you collect any samples?

527
00:37:57,901 --> 00:37:59,027
Samples?

528
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:21,881
Those were not feds.

529
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:24,134
Those were some
special forces shit.

530
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,510
<i>They were
trying to kill us.</i>

531
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:26,428
Yeah.

532
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:30,140
Yeah, great. Great.
So now we have the cops,

533
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,516
the United States Army

534
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:35,397
and some creature
from hell hunting us.

535
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,315
Oh, God, I just saw
blood mist spray

536
00:38:39,316 --> 00:38:41,528
out of the back
of an alien's face.

537
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,829
I killed someone.

538
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,083
<i>They didn't
give you a choice.</i>

539
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,961
<i>You</i> didn't give me a choice.

540
00:38:58,086 --> 00:38:59,252
<i>I couldn't get to you.</i>

541
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:02,422
Not in the rapids. A year ago
when you stole my life.

542
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,301
<i>We've been together
for a whole year?</i>

543
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:06,342
A year too long.
Just stay hidden

544
00:39:06,343 --> 00:39:08,513
while we get to New York
without getting killed.

545
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:21,735
We need you to come out.

546
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:28,033
The thing you talked about,
the creature...

547
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:29,743
It's here.

548
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:34,664
It killed some people.

549
00:39:58,188 --> 00:39:59,397
Wow.

550
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,777
He's so beautiful.

551
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:25,882
I sense...

552
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:30,303
<i>I sense my own.</i>

553
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:38,476
<i>And yet,</i>

554
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:43,483
<i>the one Knull seeks is not here.</i>

555
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,236
<i>Hmm.</i>

556
00:40:47,154 --> 00:40:48,864
<i>What does he seek?</i>

557
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:54,077
<i>The black one.</i>

558
00:40:54,828 --> 00:40:55,994
<i>Brock's symbiote?</i>

559
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:59,457
He's the only one
who carries a codex.

560
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:05,630
<i>The end is Knull.</i>

561
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:14,890
You need your suit.

562
00:41:15,015 --> 00:41:17,392
Still worried
about giving this thing a cold?

563
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:21,477
<i>Venom carries the key
to Knull's freedom.</i>

564
00:41:21,478 --> 00:41:24,105
He must never obtain it.

565
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:25,609
<i>Or your race will be killed.</i>

566
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:28,153
<i>You.</i>

567
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:31,323
And you.

568
00:41:31,865 --> 00:41:33,074
<i>And...</i>

569
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,577
you.

570
00:41:37,454 --> 00:41:40,622
<i>Everyone, everything.</i>

571
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,959
<i>How do we stop whatever's
up there from coming down here?</i>

572
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:44,794
<i>You can't.</i>

573
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:48,590
<i>He's older than the universe.</i>

574
00:41:48,882 --> 00:41:51,176
He needs the key.

575
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:56,556
<i>Then everything will end.</i>

576
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,853
<i>How do we stop him
from getting it?</i>

577
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:06,191
<i>If the symbiote
and the host are alive,</i>

578
00:42:07,067 --> 00:42:10,111
<i>then the codex is alive.</i>

579
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:13,740
And if one of them dies?

580
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,700
The codex dies.

581
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:18,119
<i>The codex dies.</i>

582
00:42:19,955 --> 00:42:22,413
- Rex, you can't be serious.
- Oh, I'm game.

583
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:24,292
Destroying the codex
is the only way

584
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:26,169
it remains unobtainable. Right?

585
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,005
<i>Hey, buddy, I'm talking to you.</i>

586
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,340
Destroying it?

587
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,133
We have barely even
scratched the surface.

588
00:42:32,259 --> 00:42:33,969
My people are dead.

589
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:38,348
Something is coming
that cannot be beaten.

590
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:40,475
I'm stopping
all this shit right now.

591
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,849
Science is sacrifice.

592
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,061
Teddy.

593
00:42:43,979 --> 00:42:45,853
This is serious.

594
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:47,607
Listen to her.

595
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,447
Have you spoken
to your family recently?

596
00:43:37,866 --> 00:43:39,409
Is everything okay?

597
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:44,622
Yeah.

598
00:43:47,459 --> 00:43:50,460
<i>I smell wet dog.
And sausamages!</i>

599
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:51,796
Hey, friend-o.

600
00:43:52,422 --> 00:43:53,423
You okay, there?

601
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:57,425
No, I'm not okay.

602
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:58,345
Uh...

603
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:00,347
It's pretty wild out there.

604
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:02,221
- I know.
- Yeah.

605
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:03,308
You hungry?

606
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:04,932
Yes.

607
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,019
Come over.

608
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:08,104
Thank you.

609
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:11,191
- So this is my wife, Nova Moon.
- Hi.

610
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:14,611
And these are my kids.
Echo and Leaf.

611
00:44:14,736 --> 00:44:16,696
- <i>A lifetime in therapy.</i>
- Don't.

612
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:17,947
Huh?

613
00:44:18,615 --> 00:44:23,203
Don't you dare! Wow.
How beautiful are your children.

614
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,413
And that's Blue.

615
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,541
- Who is a...
- Dog.

616
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,416
And I'm Martin.

617
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:32,293
- Hey, Martin.
- Hey.

618
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:33,378
I'm Eddie.

619
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:35,298
- Nice to meet you, Eddie.
- You too. Pleasure.

620
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:39,094
- Come, sit, please. Come on.
- Okay. Thank you.

621
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:41,429
Jesus Christ.

622
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:44,557
So, right.

623
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:45,973
Oh.

624
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:48,853
So nothing died on that plate.
<i>Namaste,</i> man.

625
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:51,022
- Thank you.
- <i>Hard pass!</i>

626
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,650
Oh, dear.

627
00:44:54,651 --> 00:44:56,609
- Eddie, where you headed?
- New York.

628
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:57,695
Oh, wow.

629
00:44:57,821 --> 00:44:58,780
- Yeah.
- All right.

630
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:01,866
Long way to New York
with naked shrimps, man.

631
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:03,410
Yeah.

632
00:45:03,535 --> 00:45:05,662
We could ride you out to Vegas.

633
00:45:05,787 --> 00:45:06,786
Yeah.

634
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:09,247
<i>These people are weird,
I'm telling you.</i>

635
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,498
That would be so kind.
Thank you.

636
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:11,582
You're welcome.

637
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:13,084
Of course.
Life's one big adventure.

638
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:14,546
Who doesn't love
making new friends?

639
00:45:14,671 --> 00:45:15,795
- Right?
- Right?

640
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:19,090
This guy is so one of those
serial killer hitchhikers

641
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:21,050
from my favorite murder podcast.

642
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:23,221
- Ha-ha!
- Baby. Not now.

643
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:25,515
How has social services
not taken us away yet?

644
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:29,144
She... She...
She's joking.

645
00:45:29,269 --> 00:45:32,020
- I'm not.
- Please, honey.

646
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:35,148
So we're riding
the Extraterrestrial Highway.

647
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,484
- Yeah.
- The whatchamawhosit?

648
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:39,028
It's the road
that leads to Area 51.

649
00:45:39,154 --> 00:45:41,448
See if we can spot us an alien

650
00:45:41,573 --> 00:45:43,616
before they shut the place down
forever, you know?

651
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,741
It's, uh,
it's my lifelong dream.

652
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:47,243
<i>We could show him
right now!</i>

653
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:48,329
Not a believer?

654
00:45:50,832 --> 00:45:52,834
Actually, Martin...

655
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:55,295
How do I put this?

656
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:58,715
- I am.
- Oh.

657
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:02,049
Actually, I am a big,
big believer.

658
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:04,220
- <i>You're not that big.</i>
- Oh, you a comedian now?

659
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:06,429
No, actually, I was in IT.

660
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,555
- Were you?
- Yeah.

661
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:10,226
- That's so cool.
- Oh, thanks.

662
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:13,978
I hope you don't get
disappointed, you know?

663
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:18,276
And I hope that if you
do find one, I hope you meet...

664
00:46:19,152 --> 00:46:22,906
a really good alien, not a...

665
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:25,992
not a bad...

666
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:28,244
one.

667
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:29,702
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

668
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,287
Well...

669
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:34,834
I know a dark force
when I see one, Eddie.

670
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:46,262
It's kinda hot in here.

671
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:48,097
Oh, you'll get used to it.

672
00:46:48,223 --> 00:46:50,058
AC's really bad
for your health, you know.

673
00:46:52,101 --> 00:46:53,770
All right. Family ready?

674
00:46:53,895 --> 00:46:56,731
- Yup.
- Guest ready?

675
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:58,858

Okay, bye.

Oh, yeah. I know so.

When we get out of this mess,
we'll go see her.

<i>And see a Broadway show!</i>

Well, Louise,

I'm not sure 20 bucks

00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:23,112
in the way of a motor transport.

817
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:28,615
And I'm not ever riding
an alien horse again.

818
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:31,368
So I guess it looks like
we're stealing cars.

<i>Oh! Look.</i>

836
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:23,923
<i>We need a disguise.</i>

00:58:48,901 --> 00:58:50,819
- <i>You're a sore loser!</i>
- Oh...

892
00:58:51,654 --> 00:58:53,987
I think you broke my foot.

893
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:56,742
<i>Ah!
Lady Luck is a fickle slut!</i>

894
00:58:57,368 --> 00:58:59,745
<i>We should have played</i>
that <i>machine!</i>

895
00:59:01,372 --> 00:59:03,249
No effing way.

896
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:06,877
Eddie Brock?

897
00:59:07,002 --> 00:59:09,296
Mrs. Chen! That's not yours.

898
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:12,174
- I'm sorry.
- <i>Eddie! It's Mrs. Chen!</i>

899
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:13,676
Oh, Mrs. Chen!

900
00:59:13,801 --> 00:59:14,800
Eddie, baby!

901
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:17,221
Mrs. Chen!
Mrs. Chen! Mrs. Chen!

902
00:59:17,346 --> 00:59:19,390
- <i>I'm gonna cry.</i>
- Me too.

903
00:59:20,683 --> 00:59:23,018
Wow. What happened to you?

904
00:59:23,143 --> 00:59:24,142
You look hot!

905
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:25,894
- So do you.
- <i>Really hot.</i>

906
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:27,356
- I <i>always</i> look hot.
- Yeah.

907
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:29,191
- Is the big guy in there?
- Yeah.

908
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:30,691
Do you like my dress?

909
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:32,276
I've been winning so big,
they gave me

910
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:33,527
a credit line
at the clothes store.

911
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:35,155
And then the penthouse suite!

912
00:59:35,281 --> 00:59:39,491
Wow. You know I stole this suit
off a guy who pissed on me.

913
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:41,702
I knocked him out.
I left him in a bush.

914
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:43,664
Well, that explains the stink.

915
00:59:43,789 --> 00:59:47,042
You could use my room
to clean up, and then we party.

916
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:48,711
Oh, that would be so good.

917
00:59:48,836 --> 00:59:50,713
And room service.

918
00:59:50,838 --> 00:59:53,214
<i>Oh, yes!</i>

919
01:00:03,809 --> 01:00:06,103
We got him.
Positive ID on Brock.

920
01:00:06,228 --> 01:00:09,938
CCTV hit,
the Paris Hotel, Vegas.

921
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:12,526
- Have we reconstituted The Six?
- Yes, sir.

922
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:14,320
Put 'em in.

923
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:30,667
The Six are en route.

924
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:32,254
They'll bring him in.

925
01:00:33,422 --> 01:00:37,384
At this time, I'm requesting
control of the Imperium Program.

926
01:00:40,054 --> 01:00:41,805
You have my permission, general.

927
01:00:52,024 --> 01:00:55,652
<i>When thunder roars,
head indoors.</i>

928
01:01:14,338 --> 01:01:15,631
Let's dance, baby.

929
01:01:15,756 --> 01:01:18,131
- No. No.
- <i>Yeah! I love dancing!</i>

930
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:20,803
Are you crazy?
That thing will find us.

931
01:01:20,928 --> 01:01:21,970
Don't be a party pooper.

932
01:01:22,096 --> 01:01:24,807
No! Do not encourage him.

933
01:01:24,932 --> 01:01:25,931
You know what, Mrs. Chen?

934
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:27,682
We are fugitives.
We are on the run.

935
01:01:27,683 --> 01:01:30,396
So, thank you for having us.
We gotta go.

936
01:01:30,521 --> 01:01:31,647
- <i>You're no fun!
- </i>

937
01:01:31,772 --> 01:01:33,897
One last dance before you go.

938
01:01:33,898 --> 01:01:35,023
<i>We never do anything</i>

939
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:36,235
- <i>I want to do.</i>
- What?

940
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:38,070
Just a little dance.

941
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:42,032
<i>And you gave away
my chickens.</i>

942
01:01:43,659 --> 01:01:44,660
Yeah!

943
01:01:51,083 --> 01:01:53,168
Let's cut a rug, Mrs. Chen.

944
01:01:53,961 --> 01:01:55,003
<i>I give up.</i>

945
01:01:56,422 --> 01:01:57,879
Uh-huh.

946
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,758
Ha! Ooh.

947
01:02:01,009 --> 01:02:02,761
Ha! Hmm!

948
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:04,096
Uh-huh.

949
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:06,930
<i>Oh, no,
I cannot unsee that.</i>

950
01:02:06,931 --> 01:02:08,934
<i>I cannot unsee that!</i>

<i>I told you
this would happen!</i>

961
01:02:59,443 --> 01:03:01,820
<i>Don't panic.
She can't see the codex.</i>

962
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:03,530
What the hell is that?

963
01:03:03,655 --> 01:03:05,657
Wow. So ugly!

964
01:03:07,075 --> 01:03:09,036
Stay very calm.

965
01:03:09,161 --> 01:03:11,038
She can't see the thing
she's looking for.

966
01:03:12,706 --> 01:03:13,789
Ah!

967
01:03:20,631 --> 01:03:21,715
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

968
01:03:30,307 --> 01:03:31,306
<i>Target acquired.</i>

969
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:33,101
- You leave Eddie alone!
- <i>Silence!</i>

970
01:03:35,229 --> 01:03:36,353
My shoes.

971
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:38,023
<i>Go.
Move out, move out!</i>

972
01:04:05,509 --> 01:04:07,010
Wow.

973
01:04:10,639 --> 01:04:12,097
Area 51.

974
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:13,850
- Yeah.
- Huh?

975
01:04:13,976 --> 01:04:15,185
Yeah.

976
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,272
We made it.

977
01:04:21,692 --> 01:04:23,193
You finally got to see it, Dad.

978
01:04:24,111 --> 01:04:25,862
It's kind of cool...

979
01:04:26,738 --> 01:04:28,031
I guess.

980
01:04:28,949 --> 01:04:29,950
Yeah.

981
01:04:33,161 --> 01:04:34,162
Leaf.

982
01:04:35,414 --> 01:04:37,040
Where you goin', hon?

983
01:04:37,749 --> 01:04:39,499
Well, let's see
if we can't find us

984
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,378
something cooler. Come on.

985
01:04:41,503 --> 01:04:42,586
Come on, guys.

986
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:45,005
Okay, babe.
Lifelong dream.

987
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:46,717
All right. Go, go, go, go, go!

988
01:04:47,551 --> 01:04:48,885
I smell alien.

989
01:04:54,975 --> 01:04:57,185
He's deteriorating
without his host.

990
01:04:58,020 --> 01:04:59,187
Poor thing.

991
01:05:00,355 --> 01:05:02,188
Put him below with the others.

992
01:05:02,189 --> 01:05:03,609
Safer there.

993
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:41,813
Down, down.
Come on, come on.

994
01:05:50,197 --> 01:05:53,200
All right.
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

995
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:57,828
I think we're gonna get
a better view from up there.

996
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:01,331
Follow me, guys. Come on.

997
01:06:01,332 --> 01:06:03,375
This is so exciting.

998
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:05,086
I can't believe we're here.

999
01:06:18,684 --> 01:06:19,893
Wow.

1000
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:26,400
Wow. Oh, wow.

1001
01:06:28,026 --> 01:06:29,569
What is this?

1002
01:06:40,706 --> 01:06:42,374
It's all broken.

1003
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:45,168
So sad.

1004
01:06:57,764 --> 01:06:59,099
Buddy?

1005
01:07:00,308 --> 01:07:01,643
Hey, buddy?

1006
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:06,354
Oh no.

1007
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:08,231
Oh...

1008
01:07:08,232 --> 01:07:09,401
No.

1009
01:07:11,945 --> 01:07:16,074
Oh, my God, how many hangovers
can you have in one day?

1010
01:07:17,701 --> 01:07:18,869
<i>Eddie?</i>

1011
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:25,167
Hello?

1012
01:07:27,669 --> 01:07:29,129
<i>They did this to me.</i>

1013
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:33,008
<i>Mulligan?</i>

1014
01:07:34,176 --> 01:07:35,175
<i>Why?</i>

1015
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:36,386
You're alive?

1016
01:07:37,846 --> 01:07:39,431
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

1017
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,393
<i>We're being hunted, Eddie.</i>

1018
01:07:44,186 --> 01:07:46,563
You have what he needs.

1019
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:51,985
Protect the codex
from dark hands.

1020
01:07:52,736 --> 01:07:56,446
A symbiote army waits here.

1021
01:07:56,447 --> 01:07:58,074
Free them.

1022
01:07:59,117 --> 01:08:00,535
Protect it, Eddie.

1023
01:08:01,536 --> 01:08:02,537
Knull...

1024
01:08:03,789 --> 01:08:07,083
must stay locked away.

1025
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:13,256
Eddie, I'm Dr. Paine.

1026
01:08:15,967 --> 01:08:16,968
<i>Where's my friend?</i>

1027
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:18,178
<i>He's safe for now.</i>

1028
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:20,847
Great news!

1029
01:08:20,972 --> 01:08:23,099
<i>- Oh shit.</i>
- We're all done here.

1030
01:08:23,225 --> 01:08:25,268
All of this
is out of your hands.

1031
01:08:25,393 --> 01:08:26,561
This is my lab.

1032
01:08:26,686 --> 01:08:28,895
No, no, not yours.
You just work here.

1033
01:08:28,896 --> 01:08:30,104
Or you did.

1034
01:08:30,105 --> 01:08:31,900
You, Christmas,
you're going home.

1035
01:08:32,484 --> 01:08:33,858
And what about them?

1036
01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:35,109
- You heard what it said.
<i>- Hands up.</i>

1037
01:08:35,110 --> 01:08:36,947
The codex only exists
if they're both alive.

1038
01:08:37,072 --> 01:08:38,406
Yeah, we're good. We're good.

1039
01:08:39,699 --> 01:08:41,157
You killed one of my people.

1040
01:08:41,158 --> 01:08:42,992
I'm returning the favor
personally. Please escort

1041
01:08:42,993 --> 01:08:44,077
- Dr. Paine out of here.
- No.

1042
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:45,161
<i>- Don't move.</i>
- Christmas!

1043
01:08:45,162 --> 01:08:46,289
Time to go.

1044
01:08:46,414 --> 01:08:47,499
Hey!

1045
01:08:56,925 --> 01:08:58,301
Big mistake.

1046
01:09:05,016 --> 01:09:06,893
- Fire!
- Run!

1047
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:12,858
- Oh my God!
- Fall back, fall back!

1048
01:09:13,567 --> 01:09:14,734
Go!

1049
01:09:19,614 --> 01:09:21,992
Venom, run. Go!

1050
01:09:29,708 --> 01:09:32,878
Let's go! Move! Clear! Clear!

1051
01:09:34,796 --> 01:09:36,381
Release the symbiotes!

1052
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:37,549
Go! Go!

1053
01:09:45,974 --> 01:09:47,684
- Come on.
- Go! Go!

1054
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:01,281
Hurry up! Move!

1055
01:10:02,032 --> 01:10:03,033
Get back!

1056
01:10:03,325 --> 01:10:04,284
Ah!

1057
01:10:04,409 --> 01:10:05,660
Jim!

1058
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:07,996
Ah!

1059
01:10:19,674 --> 01:10:20,800
Let's go.

1060
01:10:20,926 --> 01:10:22,052
Take her down.

1061
01:10:48,370 --> 01:10:49,621
Ah!

1062
01:10:55,335 --> 01:10:56,836
Come on!

1063
01:11:03,051 --> 01:11:04,969
Get the codex out of here.

1064
01:11:12,185 --> 01:11:13,186
That's our way out.

1065
01:11:23,989 --> 01:11:26,199
You,
break us out of here!

1066
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:32,413
- There's no aliens here, kids.
- Hmm.

1067
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:39,004
<i>Best shoes ever!</i>

1068
01:11:39,129 --> 01:11:41,256
Whoa! What was that?

1069
01:11:46,094 --> 01:11:47,762
- Okay.
- We gotta go! Move it!

1070
01:11:56,354 --> 01:11:57,355
We are leaving!

1071
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,022
Move!

1072
01:11:59,023 --> 01:12:00,358
Move, move!

1073
01:12:03,194 --> 01:12:04,904
- Dad.
- It's all right, kids.

1074
01:12:10,702 --> 01:12:13,496
Aliens! Alien invasion!

1075
01:12:13,997 --> 01:12:15,331
Alien attack!

1076
01:12:24,174 --> 01:12:26,091
Motherfucker!

1077
01:12:31,389 --> 01:12:33,183
- You two, get airborne!
- Right away, sir!

1078
01:12:33,308 --> 01:12:34,348
On me!

1079
01:12:34,349 --> 01:12:37,979
Hurry up, airborne! Move, move,
move! In the Hummers! Go!

1080
01:12:38,104 --> 01:12:39,145
<i>We've got to get the codex</i>

1081
01:12:39,146 --> 01:12:40,440
<i>as far away as possible.</i>

1082
01:12:43,318 --> 01:12:44,986
- It's Eddie?
- It's Eddie.

1083
01:12:45,528 --> 01:12:47,195
- Eddie! Hey!
- Eddie!

1084
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:48,740
- Oh, no.
- Eddie, Eddie!

1085
01:12:51,868 --> 01:12:53,953
Martin. And family.

1086
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:00,001
You can't be here, Martin.

1087
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:01,878
Dark forces, man.

1088
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:21,481
Eddie, can you help us?

1089
01:13:22,148 --> 01:13:24,651
I lied. Aliens are real.

1090
01:13:24,776 --> 01:13:26,901
My best friend
in the whole world is one.

1091
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:28,238
He's gonna get you
out of here, okay?

1092
01:13:28,363 --> 01:13:29,948
Okay.

1093
01:13:31,616 --> 01:13:34,951
- Don't... Don't be scared.
- Hi.

1094
01:13:34,952 --> 01:13:36,035
Wow.

1095
01:13:36,036 --> 01:13:39,038
Pleasure to meet you.

1096
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:40,959
Thanks for the chocolate.

1097
01:13:41,751 --> 01:13:43,419
You're welcome.

1098
01:13:50,677 --> 01:13:53,805
Ah!

1099
01:13:58,476 --> 01:13:59,602
No!

1100
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:04,149
Mom, Dad!

1101
01:14:12,657 --> 01:14:13,700
Dad!

1102
01:14:13,825 --> 01:14:15,285
Hold on, kids!

1103
01:14:18,413 --> 01:14:19,956
Hold on, kids!

1104
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:24,627
Eddie!

1105
01:14:35,722 --> 01:14:38,931
He was trying to protect you.

1106
01:14:38,932 --> 01:14:41,811
We are not the bad guys!

1107
01:14:45,273 --> 01:14:46,772
Echo! Leaf.

1108
01:14:46,773 --> 01:14:48,109
- My baby, my baby.
- Mom!

1109
01:14:48,234 --> 01:14:49,861
- Thank you, Eddie.
- You're welcome.

1110
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:55,742
You gotta be kidding me.

1111
01:15:05,084 --> 01:15:06,628
Get in!

1112
01:15:06,753 --> 01:15:07,960
Run. Run.

1113
01:15:07,961 --> 01:15:09,380
Run!

1114
01:15:11,382 --> 01:15:12,383
Eddie!

1115
01:15:26,731 --> 01:15:28,733
Go. Bring me that codex.

1116
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:34,447
What's that noise?

1117
01:15:34,572 --> 01:15:36,699
<i>She phoned home.</i>

1118
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:42,997
Oh shit.

1119
01:16:05,270 --> 01:16:08,020
- Jesus!
- Get down! Get down! Get under!

1120
01:16:08,021 --> 01:16:10,483
Take cover! Take cover!
I got you.

1121
01:16:21,035 --> 01:16:22,954
<i>She saved us.</i>

1122
01:16:24,247 --> 01:16:26,372
There's only one thing
that's gonna distract them.

1123
01:16:26,373 --> 01:16:27,583
<i>Copy.</i>

1124
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,672
- Get 'em back to their van!
- What?

1125
01:16:32,797 --> 01:16:34,632
Come on! Hurry, hurry!

1126
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:39,220
I'm gonna round them up.
Have the chopper follow me.

1127
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:43,516
Go, go, go! Go!

1128
01:16:57,030 --> 01:16:58,448
Go!

1129
01:17:00,783 --> 01:17:02,116
He's leading them to a kill box.

1130
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:04,162
When you get a lock,
vaporize 'em!

1131
01:17:28,603 --> 01:17:31,230
We're home. We're back.
Okay, okay. Hold it.

1132
01:17:31,856 --> 01:17:33,441
- Run!
- Go, kids! Go! Come on!

1133
01:17:33,566 --> 01:17:35,401
Hurry. Hurry, honey.

1134
01:17:35,526 --> 01:17:37,111
Thank you!

1135
01:17:38,696 --> 01:17:40,239
Aliens suck!

1136
01:18:04,263 --> 01:18:05,515
- Light 'em up!
- <i>Copy that.</i>

1137
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:19,194
<i>Target eliminated.</i>

1138
01:18:22,615 --> 01:18:24,283
No! No!

1139
01:18:24,409 --> 01:18:25,743
Thompson down!

1140
01:18:25,868 --> 01:18:27,745
It's coming down. Go!

1141
01:18:44,554 --> 01:18:45,555
Slide!

1142
01:18:50,476 --> 01:18:51,851
Oh sh--!

1143
01:18:51,852 --> 01:18:53,813
Oh! Go away!

1144
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:03,990
Let's finish this.

1145
01:19:04,115 --> 01:19:05,783
<i>With pleasure.</i>

1146
01:19:11,998 --> 01:19:13,624
The chopper blades!

1147
01:19:35,897 --> 01:19:37,064
I got you.

1148
01:19:42,653 --> 01:19:44,739
- It's okay.
- Get him somewhere safe.

1149
01:19:47,241 --> 01:19:48,242
Oh God.

1150
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:15,436
I'm so sorry! I'm sorry!

1151
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:17,647
Okay. Okay.

1152
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:38,751
No.

1153
01:20:40,878 --> 01:20:42,713
Okay. Okay.

1154
01:20:46,759 --> 01:20:48,886
Still living
your brother's dream?

1155
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:57,353
Oh, my God.

1156
01:21:02,024 --> 01:21:04,817
- I'm coming! I'm coming!
- Dad, come on!

1157
01:21:04,818 --> 01:21:07,154
Dad! Dad! Run! Come on!

1158
01:21:34,765 --> 01:21:36,434
I'm proud of you, Eddie.

1159
01:21:36,559 --> 01:21:38,269
You did it all yourself.

1160
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:41,355
Well, some of it.

1161
01:21:57,830 --> 01:22:00,416
I really would have liked
to have seen her.

1162
01:22:05,796 --> 01:22:06,839
Who?

1163
01:22:07,506 --> 01:22:09,008
Lady Liberty.

1164
01:22:10,051 --> 01:22:11,385
Oh, yeah.

1165
01:22:12,595 --> 01:22:15,890
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, well, we're going.

1166
01:22:16,849 --> 01:22:19,185
We're gonna go just as soon
as we get...

1167
01:22:20,436 --> 01:22:21,604
out of here.

1168
01:22:23,522 --> 01:22:25,856
They're just going
to keep coming.

1169
01:22:25,857 --> 01:22:28,109
We'll never leave
this place, friend.

1170
01:22:39,914 --> 01:22:41,374
Okay, well...

1171
01:22:44,043 --> 01:22:46,879
I thought we were gonna be
the Lethal Protector.

1172
01:22:50,466 --> 01:22:52,301
We are.

1173
01:22:53,177 --> 01:22:54,887
That's what this is.

1174
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:06,273
Yeah.

1175
01:23:31,966 --> 01:23:32,967
All right.

1176
01:23:37,388 --> 01:23:38,639
All right.

1177
01:23:49,859 --> 01:23:51,152
Come and get us.

1178
01:24:55,466 --> 01:24:57,343
- Go.
- Huh?

1179
01:24:57,468 --> 01:24:59,970
Go.

1180
01:25:06,227 --> 01:25:08,229
Oh, my God.

1181
01:25:18,823 --> 01:25:19,824
What are you doin'?

1182
01:25:23,285 --> 01:25:25,037
I'll never forget you.

1183
01:25:28,833 --> 01:25:31,877
Don't forget me either, Eddie.

1184
01:25:32,002 --> 01:25:33,170
No.

1185
01:25:33,295 --> 01:25:34,672
Time to go.

1186
01:25:37,883 --> 01:25:39,049
Strickland.

1187
01:25:39,050 --> 01:25:40,385
<i>Strickland authorized.</i>

1188
01:25:42,304 --> 01:25:43,305
No.

1189
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:02,447
Strickland.

1190
01:26:02,448 --> 01:26:03,784
<i>Strickland authorized.</i>

1191
01:26:17,381 --> 01:26:18,424
Oh?

1192
01:26:19,425 --> 01:26:21,594
Huh? Huh?

1193
01:26:27,141 --> 01:26:29,184
It's just bye for now.

1194
01:26:48,829 --> 01:26:49,870
No.

1195
01:26:49,871 --> 01:26:52,458
No! No!

1196
01:27:27,534 --> 01:27:28,577
Go!

1197
01:27:56,438 --> 01:27:58,107
No, Eddie!

1198
01:27:58,899 --> 01:28:00,941
Eddie!

1199
01:28:00,942 --> 01:28:02,027
Oh, my God.

1200
01:28:51,702 --> 01:28:53,203
Nierika.

1201
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:19,354
<i>Hey, buddy.</i>

1202
01:29:21,315 --> 01:29:23,150
I just had a crazy dream.

1203
01:29:30,616 --> 01:29:31,617
Buddy?

1204
01:29:31,742 --> 01:29:33,327
He's not coming back.

1205
01:29:41,585 --> 01:29:43,212
But I need him back.

1206
01:29:44,004 --> 01:29:46,213
He wasn't meant for this place.

1207
01:29:46,214 --> 01:29:48,008
You couldn't have kept him...

1208
01:29:48,967 --> 01:29:50,469
and he couldn't have kept you.

1209
01:29:52,805 --> 01:29:53,970
For your bravery,

1210
01:29:53,971 --> 01:29:57,309
you both have the heartfelt
thanks of a grateful nation.

1211
01:29:59,853 --> 01:30:01,772
Eddie, you're free
to start your life again.

1212
01:30:02,648 --> 01:30:04,731
Everything that happened
in San Francisco

1213
01:30:04,732 --> 01:30:06,401
and in the last few days...

1214
01:30:07,027 --> 01:30:08,779
consider it expunged.

1215
01:30:15,452 --> 01:30:17,869
Just so you're clear,
of course...

1216
01:30:17,870 --> 01:30:20,749
you ever breathe a word of this
to any living soul

1217
01:30:20,874 --> 01:30:23,500
you will spend
the rest of <i>that</i> life

1218
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:26,505
in the coldest,
darkest hole imaginable.

1219
01:30:28,924 --> 01:30:30,259
Good luck, Eddie.
