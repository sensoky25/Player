1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000


2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000


3
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:35,387
{\an8}Hey, slow down, Mike, okay?
You're making me sick.

4
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,890
I would slow down
if you hadn't already made us late.

5
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:45,689
We're... We're not late, okay?
You're just anxious.

6
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,108
No, I'm anxious
'cause you made us late.

7
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,402
{\an8}I'm not doin' this with you
in the next phase of our lives.

8
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:51,653
{\an8}You're gon' respect my time.

9
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,160
My stomach. My stomach.

10
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,246
{\an8}Hey, Mike, look,
pull over at that store right there.

11
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,581
I need a ginger ale.

12
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:05,626
{\an8}Look, we don't have no time
to get no ginger ale, man.

13
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,461
{\an8}Come on, Mike, I'm sick.

14
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,505
{\an8}You're freaking me out, okay?

15
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:12,424
I feel like I'm gonna throw...
throw up.

16
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:13,634
I dare you, Marcus.

17
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:23,769
You got 90 seconds, all right?

18
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,729
{\an8}Ginger ale and nothing else.

19
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:29,316
{\an8}I am a grown-ass man, okay?

20
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,484
Just be nice.

21
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,861
Oh. Okay. 85 seconds.

22
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,093
Are those dogs fresh?

23
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,845
I put 'em on yesterday.

24
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:03,433
Well, give me one and put some relish
and some mustard on that motherfucker.

25
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,269
{\an8}Hook it up. Come on, hurry up.

26
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:09,356
{\an8}No, that one right there.
Yeah. Yeah, that right there. Hurry up.

27
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,442
{\an8}Gotta go, gotta go.

28
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,944
Don't be takin' your time.

29
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:16,697
Yeah, my man.

30
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,701
Hey, open the register.

31
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:24,496
- No, no, no.
- Now!

32
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,498
Sir, today is not the day.

33
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:27,624
Shut the fuck up!

34
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:31,628
Look, if I'm not in that car in 15 seconds,

35
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:35,632
there's a very surly man that's comin' in here
and we both are fucked.

36
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,217
- Marcus.
- Hey, don't fuckin' move.

37
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,844
The fuck over there!

38
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:41,680
'Ey, Mike, I told this guy I had to go.

39
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,516
Is that Skittles on the counter, Marcus?

40
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:47,394
Well, he was takin' a long time
with the ginger ale.

41
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:50,689
That is incorrect. He grabbed that ginger ale
the second he came in here.

42
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:51,857
A hot dog, Marcus?

43
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,234
You're not supposed to be eatin' that shit.

44
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,278
- This is not mine, Mike.
- Yes, it is.

45
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:59,823
Mind your business with your tattletaling ass.

46
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,200
Everybody shut the fuck up!

47
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,660
Sir, I'm gonna need you
to lower your weapon.

48
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,787
Come take my weapon, then, motherfucker.

49
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,497
Don't antagonize him.

50
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,749
Marcus, get in the car.

51
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,168
Mike, he has a gun to my head.

52
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:12,836
Wanna deal with him,
you wanna deal with me?

53
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:17,591
Sorry, sir, but I gotta go.

54
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,683
You didn't have to shoot him, Mike.

55
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,270
Get in the car.

56
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,273
Call 911.

57
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:34,858
Aren't you the police?

58
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,534
<i>Other people look at you</i>

59
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:48,247
and see the tailored suits,
the cars, the watches.

60
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,333
I met you without any of that.

61
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,336
Stripped, basically naked...

62
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:57,714
which is 90% of why I'm marrying you.

63
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:02,261
I met you at your lowest.

64
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,305
You'd been shot.

65
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:09,351
But there was a fire in you that was...

66
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:11,186
...extraordinary.

67
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,900
And I vow to spend the rest of my life
fanning that flame.

68
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:20,821
I now pronounce you...

69
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,157
husband and wife.

70
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,577
You may kiss the bride.

71
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:27,744
Yes!

72
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:30,122
I love it.

73
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:45,804
You know, it kinda makes sense
that he married his therapist after he got shot.

74
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:48,724
I love that for him.
Mental health is super important.

75
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:50,350
Well, it was his physical therapist.

76
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,729
- Congratulations, Michael.
- Rita. Thank you, thank you.

77
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:55,564
Mr. Mayor.

78
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,567
Oh, not yet. Don't jinx it.
I'm still just a lowly US Attorney.

79
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:01,486
I've been watching what you're doin'.

80
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,238
- You got my vote.
- Thank you.

81
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:05,407
Congratulations to you.

82
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:08,577
I mean, the definition
of a power couple right there.

83
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,830
- I'll grab you a drink.
- Okay.

84
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,166
- Can I get you anything?
- No, I'm good, thank you.

85
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:18,212
And all this time,
I thought you were a terminal bachelor.

86
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:22,508
I... I... I even surprised myself with this one.

87
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:25,802
Yeah, I guess
you just hadn't met the right one.

88
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,971
I had some growing up to do.

89
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,431
You were 50.

90
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,019
Okay.

91
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:38,440
I'm gonna pre-apologize
for whatever he says.

92
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,153
Mike.

93
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,531
- No, you know how it is.
- Don't... Marcus!

94
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:47,449
- Marcus. Come...
- Let me get it out!

95
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:48,575
Come on, man.

96
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,744
- Everything you have been through, man.
- Okay.

97
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,829
The witch. The <i>Bruja.</i>

98
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,289
The prostitute.

99
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:58,836
My sister. 'Member?
You coulda told me about my sister, Mike.

100
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:00,379
You coulda told me that.

101
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:03,465
I would've embraced you,
if that's who she was feeling.

102
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:04,967
- I love you, Mike.
- No doubt.

103
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,429
You know, Cap would've loved
to have been here to see this.

104
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,764
But you know what?

105
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:15,185
We got his daughter, Judy,
and his granddaughter, Callie.

106
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,436
She wants to say something.

107
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:21,775
My granddad loved you guys.

108
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:26,655
And if he were here,
he would have told you not to F this up.

109
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:29,616
That's what he would've said.

110
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,035
Yeah, he woulda said "Don't fuck it up."

111
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:33,287
Exactly.

112
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:34,830
Oh, excuse me.

113
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,206
'Ey.

114
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:41,086
Mike, you been my partner a long time.

115
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,671
Yes, sir.

116
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:45,299
Now he's gonna be your partner, Christine.

117
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:49,970
To Mike and Christine Lowrey.

118
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,514
- For life!
- For life!

119
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:15,495
Go Marcus! Go Marcus!
Go Marcus! Go Marcus!

120
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:27,132
Oh, shit.

121
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:33,931
What happened? What happened?!

122
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:35,265
Marcus. Marcus!

123
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,433
What's the address?

124
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,852
Let me in, let me in, let me in. Back up.

125
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:42,940
This is Captain Rita Secada.
I have an officer in cardiac arrest.

126
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:54,451
Come on, man.

127
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:42,791
It's not your time.

128
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:38,764
Marcus!

129
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,854
Marc-- Marc--!

130
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,066
This guy.

131
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,413
Hey, buddy.

132
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:04,581
What you doing?

133
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:08,001
I spent my whole life being scared, Mike.

134
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:11,421
I wasted so much time.

135
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,714
Why... Why... Why don't you...

136
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:15,884
Why don't you just step back
from the edge a little bit, please.

137
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,428
What year is it?

138
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:20,430
It's Tuesday.

139
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:23,642
Same year your ass was wobbling in.

140
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:26,603
Oh, wow. Felt like it was five years.

141
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:29,731
I was in the basement of the ocean.

142
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:32,025
All my bullshit was gone.

143
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,819
Just freedom.

144
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:37,155
And full body love, Mike.
Full body love.

145
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,323
Okay.

146
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:39,700
Why... Why... Why don't you...

147
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:43,829
...love your full body
back from the ledge, please?

148
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:45,289
Nothing to be scared of.

149
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:48,375
It's not my time, baby.
It's not my time.

150
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,544
Mr. Burnett!

151
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:52,296
Hey, I got him.

152
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:53,922
He's just...

153
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:59,011
I don't know what the fuck he's doing.

154
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:02,890
But I got it. I got him.
We're good. We are good.

155
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,392
- We are great!
- 'Ey...

156
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,436
Miami!

157
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,938
305 for life!

158
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,064
Kakow!

159
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:14,151
All right. Just stop. You gon' put
somebody's eye out with that thing, man.

160
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:16,361
- I'm bringing the thunder, Mike.
- I get it.

161
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,446
Bringing the thunder.

162
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,365
All right. There you go.

163
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:23,076
Oh, man. Bring it in.

164
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,995
Thought I lost you, brother.

165
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:27,247
Couldn't lose me if you tried.

166
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,002
You know your ass is out, right?

167
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:34,505
Everybody's ass is out, Mike.

168
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:36,089
Hey.

169
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:38,967
There's a storm coming.

170
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,596
No. Not that kind of storm.

171
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:45,098
You're gonna be tested.

172
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,184
Things are gonna get bad,

173
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:49,978
and you're gonna have to make
a really hard choice.

174
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:53,190
Just know you're good.

175
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:21,468
This is my private time, Mr. McGrath.

176
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:22,928
How may I help you?

177
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:25,931
- I need you to move some money.
- Your money?

178
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:28,725
Your boss's, actually.
I need it to be cartel cash.

179
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,644
Just under 20 million.

180
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:34,690
Backdated series of transfers
beginning 2004, ending January 2020...

181
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:36,567
into...

182
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:38,944
...that account.

183
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:41,989
In the name
of the late Captain Conrad Howard.

184
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,158
I have people who can handle logistics.

185
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,870
I really just need your login credentials.

186
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,122
And why would I give you those?

187
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:51,999
Oh, my God!

188
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:00,132
Come here, darling.

189
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:01,967
Come on.

190
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:05,554
Come here.

191
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:14,062
You can't transfer funds from a phone.

192
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:21,320
<i>Hey, honey, what's going on?</i>

193
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:24,198
Do they know each other?

194
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:27,576
<i>Honey, who's there with you?</i>

195
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:29,203
- All right, all right!
<i>- Honey--?</i>

196
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:40,130
Here we go.

197
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:45,719
They'll kill you for this.

198
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,554
They're not even gonna know
this happened.

199
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:53,477
Your girlfriend
heard you on the phone with your wife

200
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:56,355
and realized
you were never gonna divorce her.

201
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:59,149
And in a fit of passion, she shot you.

202
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:03,820
Your bodyguard tried to step in,
but he was too late.

203
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,951
And realizing the horror of her actions...

204
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:13,163
she took her own life.

205
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:14,248
No!

206
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:25,884
<i>Honey, what are you doing?</i>

207
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:28,387
<i>- You had a heart attack two weeks ago.</i>
- Exactly.

208
00:15:28,387 --> 00:15:32,683
They call it a widow-maker for a reason.
You need to be in the hospital, baby.

209
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:34,893
Hey, I tried to told his ass, T.

210
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:39,982
Apparently, he's an adult.
He was allowed to sign hisself out.

211
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:43,819
Hey, babe. Look, come on.
I couldn't take one more second away from you.

212
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:47,197
All these stents in me got my blood flowing.

213
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:50,117
- I'm on D way.
- All right, now.

214
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,954
Ey. Ey. Come on, man.
That's my phone.

215
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:56,456
<i>- I love you, Marcus.</i>
- We'll be there in 10.

216
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,542
All right, babe. All right. Love you.

217
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:01,336
<i>Hey, Mike.</i>

218
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:03,213
I wasn't even gonna tell you this...

219
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:05,424
but this ain't the first time we done this.

220
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:07,217
We ride together all the time,
what you mean?

221
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:09,553
No, I'm talking about our souls.

222
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:12,639
You know, we've ridden together,
but I saw it all, Mike.

223
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,018
We're bound.
And we have been for lifetimes.

224
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:20,689
We haven't always been Mike and Marcus,
but we've always been us.

225
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,776
What you talking 'bout?

226
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:27,070
We're soulmates.

227
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:29,990
- Yup.
- Yeah.

228
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:31,783
Naw.

229
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:36,330
Yeah, I kind of... I saw my soulmate
looking a little different than that.

230
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,582
See... See, Mike, you stuck in the physical.

231
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:40,542
Souls don't have dicks.

232
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,669
I'm pretty sure
my soul has a dick, Marcus.

233
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:47,090
See? That's that shit right there.
That's why we're stuck.

234
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:50,385
You know, I wasn't gonna tell you
this shit either,

235
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:53,680
but my soul
is more advanced than your soul.

236
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:58,268
It's not that your soul is stupid.

237
00:16:58,268 --> 00:16:59,394
You know?

238
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:04,316
It's just that you're more like a baby soul.
You know?

239
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:06,818
And I'm more like a mother soul.

240
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:08,737
And I just gotta suckle ya.

241
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:11,781
You know? Put you on that titty.

242
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:14,409
You know?

243
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:17,913
Hey. How long you think
your brain went without oxygen?

244
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,042
- Daddy!
- Daddy's home.

245
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:27,047
- Baby! Oh, baby, you're back.
- Where my family? My family.

246
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:28,423
Hey, baby.

247
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:32,553
Little Marcus!

248
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:36,723
Say hi to Pop-pop.
Say hi to Granddad.

249
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:39,726
- I missed you so--!
- Look at you, woman.

250
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,728
No, come on, look at me, baby.

251
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:49,236
We're gonna have to hose them down.

252
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,947
All right. All right, we get it. We get it.

253
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:55,534
Put some ice in your drawers or somethin'.

254
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:57,369
That's funny.

255
00:17:58,287 --> 00:17:59,788
Are you feeling good, Marcus?

256
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:01,707
I never felt better in my life.

257
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:06,253
Oh, Marcus, I missed you so much, honey,
but you need to get some rest.

258
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:08,755
Oh, no, baby, I need you.

259
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,884
- Just let me get some electrolytes.
- Okay, baby. Give me a kiss.

260
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:16,180
So, what's going on with my dad?

261
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:19,933
Well, he was on the roof naked...

262
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:24,980
and he said he had been
at the basement of the ocean.

263
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:27,816
"Amazing Chickpeas"?

264
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:30,819
Oh, and he said I have a stupid baby soul

265
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:32,613
with no penis.

266
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,367
- Hey, Reggie.
- Yes, sir.

267
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:40,037
- Did you eat my snacks?
- No, sir.

268
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:42,497
I was looking forward to my snacks, Reggie.

269
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:44,041
Honey.

270
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:48,754
You know what? You need to get a job.

271
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:50,547
I'm a US Marine, sir.

272
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:52,132
Well, then you need to deploy.

273
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:53,884
You know, we just got back from Yemen.

274
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:55,969
Thank you for your service.

275
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:58,639
- You thought I was dead, didn't you?
- Dead?

276
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:00,140
One thing you don't know, Reggie.

277
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:03,393
I got a camera up in here. Yeah.

278
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:10,484
Theresa!

279
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:14,905
It's the doctor's orders, Marcus.
You're on a strict diet. No salt, no sugar, no fats.

280
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:17,908
No stress, no loud noises, no physical exertion.

281
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:20,077
Just sit your ass down somewhere, man.

282
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:21,370
Tell him, Mike.

283
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,748
And, honey, I'm doing it with you.
We're now vegetarians.

284
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:27,251
Vegetarians? Look at me.

285
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:31,004
Look at all this man, baby. I'm brand-new.

286
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:34,007
I need animal sugars to survive.

287
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:36,051
Well, baby...

288
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:38,095
I have a salad for you.

289
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:39,179
A salad?!

290
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:43,559
Hey, T, looks like you got this under control.
My tour of duty is done.

291
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:46,144
- Bye, Christine. Bye, Mike.
- Bye, guys.

292
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:48,480
Hey, Mike. Wait up.
Wait up, wait up.

293
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:51,733
What you about to do?
Can you run a quick-quick for me?

294
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:53,402
Yeah, what you need?

295
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:57,030
I'll give you $1,000 for some Skittles.

296
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,117
Marcus, I am not buying your ass no candy, man.

297
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:04,913
Okay, $2,000, Mike, for some Ding Dongs.
And that's my final offer.

298
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:07,749
I think you're gonna be Ding Dong-less...

299
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:09,334
like my soul.

300
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:42,284
<i>You always take whoever I love.</i>

301
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,957
<i>This is Detective Mike Lowrey.</i>

302
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:50,042
The Captain is down.

303
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:51,627
<i>He's my son.</i>

304
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:53,962
<i>You got a fucked up family, Mike.</i>

305
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:21,406
{\an8}<i>The Department of Justice has been investigating
the corruption in the Miami Police Department.</i>

306
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:23,951
<i>And we now have credible intelligence</i>

307
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:27,329
{\an8}<i>that Captain Conrad Howard
was directing these elements</i>

308
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:29,498
{\an8}<i>in coordination with the cartels.</i>

309
00:21:32,835 --> 00:21:35,462
No, I'm not interested
in <i>approximately</i> what time.

310
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:38,632
I need to know <i>exactly</i> what time,
do you understand?

311
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:40,884
You knew about this?

312
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:43,345
I found out two weeks ago.

313
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:44,930
A press conference. Really?

314
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,224
I'm sorry about the way
you had to find out.

315
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:49,935
- But given your closeness--
- Our closeness?

316
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:53,564
Neither one of y'all would have a job
if it wasn't for Captain Howard.

317
00:21:53,564 --> 00:21:55,399
Rita, you know this is not true.

318
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:57,442
Honestly, I don't.

319
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:00,571
The investigation
has turned up new evidence.

320
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:03,782
Miami law enforcement's been
a leaky ship for years now.

321
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:07,119
Witnesses turn up dead, informants disappear.

322
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:12,165
Events appear random
until you aggregate them over a period of years.

323
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:14,168
Then a pattern emerges.

324
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:15,752
Who is this?

325
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:19,464
Bud Grice, FBI, heading up the JTF on this show.

326
00:22:19,464 --> 00:22:20,674
That's who I am.

327
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:24,011
Now, we knew
someone was providing intelligence

328
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:26,513
to a cartel moving product
into South Florida.

329
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:28,265
We just didn't know who.

330
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:32,394
A cartel banker turned up dead two weeks ago,
shot by his girlfriend.

331
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:34,813
They found a phone with Howard's contact on it.

332
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:39,193
Years of communication with the cartel,
account references offshore.

333
00:22:39,193 --> 00:22:41,028
Millions in Howard's name.

334
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:43,322
Final piece we needed
to nail that dirty motherfucker.

335
00:22:43,322 --> 00:22:45,991
- Grice!
- Oh, whoa. Hey, hey, let me holler at you.

336
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:49,620
You know I was with him when he went down, right?

337
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:53,040
Call him dirty one more time.

338
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:54,917
I dare you.

339
00:22:57,586 --> 00:23:00,297
We know he had others who were with him.
We're gonna find them too.

340
00:23:00,297 --> 00:23:01,381
I was with him.

341
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:04,551
- Put the cuffs on me right now. I was with him.
- Mike.

342
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:08,055
No, these motherfuckers think
that just 'cause he's dead and can't defend hisself,

343
00:23:08,055 --> 00:23:11,266
they gon' dump all this shit on him,
burn his legacy.

344
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:12,935
Not on my watch.

345
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:20,359
This is Judy Howard, US Marshals.

346
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:22,694
I realize I have no jurisdiction here.

347
00:23:22,694 --> 00:23:24,363
But as a professional courtesy,

348
00:23:24,363 --> 00:23:28,450
I'd like to request visibility into the sources
of the allegations against my father.

349
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,743
Judy.

350
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:32,454
We're gonna figure this shit out, all right?

351
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,540
How's Callie?

352
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:37,334
How do you think, Mike?

353
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:39,878
We're on the same team here, Judy.

354
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:41,755
Like hell we are, Mike.

355
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:45,592
My dad would still be alive
if it weren't for your bastard son.

356
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:46,677
Judy...

357
00:23:46,677 --> 00:23:49,388
If I ever catch him out on the street,
I swear on my father

358
00:23:49,388 --> 00:23:51,431
I will put him down.

359
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:54,351
Come on. Come on, man. Come on.

360
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:00,649
So, what's our next move?

361
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:04,319
They said he was working with the cartel.
Let's ask the cartel.

362
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:16,874
How you doin'?

363
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:18,917
It's prison.

364
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:20,294
Yeah.

365
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:22,880
Look. We need your help.

366
00:24:23,881 --> 00:24:25,716
They're saying
that Captain Howard was dirty.

367
00:24:25,716 --> 00:24:27,426
Do you know anything about that?

368
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:32,055
- How much time I get off for this one?
- I'm still working on that.

369
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:35,642
This is me telling you that I need you.

370
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:41,023
I need to know if Captain Howard
was working with the cartels.

371
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:45,694
No.

372
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:48,405
He was onto the ones that were.

373
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:51,033
So he got greenlit.

374
00:24:52,951 --> 00:24:54,203
Wait, no.

375
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:57,414
No, Captain Howard was killed
because he was on your mother's hit list.

376
00:24:57,414 --> 00:24:59,416
He was added to it.

377
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:02,252
Your people wanted it to look like us.

378
00:25:03,337 --> 00:25:05,506
Your people wanted him dead.

379
00:25:05,506 --> 00:25:07,841
Whatchu mean, "our people"?

380
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:09,510
You should be careful.

381
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:12,971
You're playing a game
and you don't even know the rules.

382
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:16,141
- There's dirty players on your side.
- That's bullshit.

383
00:25:16,141 --> 00:25:17,309
Wait, who?

384
00:25:18,227 --> 00:25:19,603
I saw him one time.

385
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:26,735
- Can you ID him?
<i>- Sí.</i>

386
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:29,238
Give me a name.

387
00:25:29,238 --> 00:25:30,656
I don't know his name.

388
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:32,241
My mother.

389
00:25:32,741 --> 00:25:34,451
<i>She's the one who dealt with him.</i>

390
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:38,455
I knew we should have kept
that damn witch alive.

391
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:39,623
Marcus.

392
00:25:39,623 --> 00:25:42,000
May she rest in peace.

393
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,168
Dude.

394
00:25:51,093 --> 00:25:52,177
Hey, boss.

395
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:55,430
Our man on the inside
got all of Howard's records in the JTF file.

396
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:58,183
Computers, phones, files, all of it.

397
00:25:58,183 --> 00:26:00,602
Well, we know Howard was onto our operation.

398
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:03,146
We just don't know how much he had.
We need to make sure we got every trace.

399
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:04,523
That's beautiful.

400
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:06,817
Hey, boss.

401
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:09,778
It's all the paper files.
They're clean so far.

402
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:12,573
Two phones had nothing.
His office computer was empty.

403
00:26:12,573 --> 00:26:14,199
- He was careful.
- But?

404
00:26:14,825 --> 00:26:17,411
But his old personal laptop
had weak encryption.

405
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:20,622
Here we go.

406
00:26:23,292 --> 00:26:25,210
Shit. We tripped a fail-safe.

407
00:26:25,878 --> 00:26:27,337
The fuck you mean, "we"?

408
00:26:28,005 --> 00:26:29,214
Something was sent.

409
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:31,133
To who?

410
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:33,719
Tracing the phone now.

411
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:41,560
What the hell?

412
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,645
He's texting us from the other side.

413
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:45,814
No, he's not, Marcus.

414
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:52,905
<i>If you're seeing this...</i>

415
00:26:53,906 --> 00:26:55,073
<i>I'm probably dead.</i>

416
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:56,575
<i>Fuck!</i>

417
00:26:57,159 --> 00:26:58,160
<i>Fuck me.</i>

418
00:26:58,911 --> 00:27:00,037
<i>Before I begin...</i>

419
00:27:00,913 --> 00:27:02,539
<i>I wanna say one thing:</i>

420
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:05,167
<i>I'm putting you in mortal danger.</i>

421
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:06,502
<i>Boys...</i>

422
00:27:07,002 --> 00:27:09,463
<i>we got rats in our walls.</i>

423
00:27:09,463 --> 00:27:13,467
<i>But I gotta make sure
you're my bad boys.</i>

424
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:18,555
<i>The Coke-bottle giant is the key.</i>

425
00:27:19,348 --> 00:27:20,349
What?

426
00:27:20,349 --> 00:27:23,018
<i>Don't trust anybody.</i>

427
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:29,399
What's that? What does that mean?
"The Coke-bottle giant."

428
00:27:32,945 --> 00:27:34,029
Fletcher.

429
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:35,906
Oh, shit.

430
00:27:36,448 --> 00:27:37,449
These are the guys.

431
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:44,081
We should put a bullet in these motherfuckers.
Be done with it once and for all.

432
00:27:44,081 --> 00:27:47,000
Lintz, I love you. I'd like nothing more
than to let you loose on them.

433
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,586
But extra dead cops
doesn't do us any favors here.

434
00:27:50,963 --> 00:27:54,633
<i>Keep them under constant surveillance
and see if they make a move.</i>

435
00:27:58,303 --> 00:28:00,597
Fletcher's warehouse
is right down that alley.

436
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:02,808
Mike, I wasn't even gonna tell you this.

437
00:28:03,475 --> 00:28:04,685
Then don't tell me.

438
00:28:04,685 --> 00:28:07,813
No, you gotta hear this. This is big.

439
00:28:08,522 --> 00:28:10,107
I can't die.

440
00:28:10,816 --> 00:28:11,859
What?

441
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:13,944
I cannot die.

442
00:28:13,944 --> 00:28:17,990
Motherfucker, you did a pretty good job of dying
at my wedding a couple weeks ago.

443
00:28:18,115 --> 00:28:19,616
But I didn't.

444
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:20,826
Watch.

445
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:23,287
Hey, Marcus.

446
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:27,791
- Hey!
- Come on! Get out of the road!

447
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:29,543
Hey!

448
00:28:31,795 --> 00:28:32,921
Hey! Marcus!

449
00:28:34,673 --> 00:28:35,674
Hey, stop, stop.

450
00:28:35,674 --> 00:28:38,385
Hey, hey! Marcus!

451
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:39,720
What are you, some kind of moron?!

452
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,180
Stop, stop, stop.

453
00:28:43,182 --> 00:28:44,183
Police! Stop!

454
00:28:47,728 --> 00:28:50,147
- Hey!
- Bro!

455
00:28:50,147 --> 00:28:51,356
Slow down!

456
00:28:51,356 --> 00:28:52,941
Crosswalk!

457
00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:58,864
Talk to me.

458
00:28:58,864 --> 00:29:00,908
You gotta trust, Mike.

459
00:29:00,908 --> 00:29:04,077
Trust yourself. Trust the universe.

460
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:06,997
Stop that shit, Marcus.

461
00:29:06,997 --> 00:29:09,124
It's not my time, Mike.

462
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:13,545
Oh, okay. So you're saying
that if I shoot you in your face,

463
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:15,255
you're saying that you won't die.

464
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:18,634
Fate dictates
that you won't shoot me in the face.

465
00:29:18,634 --> 00:29:21,553
I'm saying... I'm...
I'm saying that you saying

466
00:29:21,553 --> 00:29:25,807
that if I shoot you in your face,
are you saying you won't die?

467
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:28,352
Fate doesn't deal in hypotheticals, Mike.

468
00:29:30,521 --> 00:29:32,147
I'm gonna call the police.

469
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:34,733
They're already here, ma'am. Mind your business.

470
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:36,443
Just go to the beach.

471
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:38,987
Stop that shit, Marcus.

472
00:29:40,739 --> 00:29:43,158
See? You're putting your gun away.

473
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:44,910
He's putting his gun away.

474
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:54,002
Ooh, Mike.

475
00:29:58,549 --> 00:29:59,800
Focus, man.

476
00:30:00,384 --> 00:30:03,929
Yeah, I call this place, you know,
Creative Space for Black Imagination.

477
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:06,390
- You know that...
- Fletcher.

478
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,183
Oh, my God.

479
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:09,601
Thank you.

480
00:30:09,601 --> 00:30:11,436
What the hell is this place?

481
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:15,607
This is my studio gallery. I'm an <i>artiste</i> now.

482
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:17,317
Please, you ain't no damn artist.

483
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:21,864
- What do you guys want?
- Captain Howard.

484
00:30:21,864 --> 00:30:25,701
Yeah. I was sorry to hear what happened to him.
He helped turn my life around.

485
00:30:25,701 --> 00:30:27,619
He told us to talk to you.

486
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:29,037
Okay. Talk to me.

487
00:30:29,705 --> 00:30:32,583
- I just talked to you.
- Then say what you're supposed to say.

488
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:34,376
- I said what I'm supposed to say.
- You didn't.

489
00:30:34,376 --> 00:30:37,254
- Then tell me what I'm supposed to say.
- I've said all I can say.

490
00:30:37,254 --> 00:30:39,381
Fucking with us, beanstalk?!

491
00:30:39,381 --> 00:30:41,633
Marcus! Come on!

492
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:44,428
Captain Howard saved my life.
I'm not messing this up.

493
00:30:44,428 --> 00:30:48,390
I can't say what I supposed to say
until you say what you supposed to say.

494
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,934
Fletcher, just tell us
what you supposed to tell us.

495
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:52,269
Dumbasses. Look.

496
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:55,230
Captain Howard was onto something big.

497
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:59,651
He didn't trust that you dumb fucks
would figure it out, so he contacted me.

498
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:02,946
Because you're stupid,
and I'm a genius.

499
00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:06,617
So I protected the information
in something.

500
00:31:09,328 --> 00:31:12,414
In something beautiful.

501
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,213
Flex your face one more time. Flex it again!

502
00:31:19,213 --> 00:31:22,132
I will blow your fucking head off.

503
00:31:22,132 --> 00:31:24,801
Would you stop?! Come on.

504
00:31:25,677 --> 00:31:29,431
In something that will live forever.

505
00:31:34,978 --> 00:31:36,146
Did you shoot him?!

506
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,357
I don't think so.

507
00:31:49,243 --> 00:31:50,285
Freeze!

508
00:31:50,285 --> 00:31:51,703
Marcus. Marcus!

509
00:32:22,192 --> 00:32:23,735
You hit?

510
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:24,820
Nah-ah.

511
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:27,489
Black jellybean. Nobody likes that shit.

512
00:32:33,537 --> 00:32:34,580
Whoa.

513
00:32:40,836 --> 00:32:43,088
Hey! Stop that stupid shit!

514
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:50,345
I'm not fucking with you! Stop!

515
00:32:57,144 --> 00:32:59,855
No! No, no! No! No!

516
00:33:12,242 --> 00:33:14,244
I don't give a fuck!

517
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,371
Marcus! No! No!

518
00:33:44,566 --> 00:33:45,901
What are you doing?!

519
00:33:45,901 --> 00:33:48,695
- I got this!
- But you don't, though.

520
00:33:48,695 --> 00:33:49,780
No. No!

521
00:33:51,323 --> 00:33:52,366
Marc--!

522
00:33:56,495 --> 00:33:57,704
Let's go! Let's move!

523
00:33:59,331 --> 00:34:00,332
Marcus!

524
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:07,047
Burnett and Lowrey are moving north on 11th.

525
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:31,822
Miami PD! Go!

526
00:34:33,031 --> 00:34:36,451
- What are you doing?!
- I'm fightin' crime, baby!

527
00:34:36,451 --> 00:34:37,536
Freeze!

528
00:35:04,563 --> 00:35:06,106
Mike!

529
00:35:25,334 --> 00:35:27,419
Have you ever had a panic attack before?

530
00:35:27,419 --> 00:35:30,714
What? Ain't nobody have no damn panic attack.

531
00:35:30,714 --> 00:35:35,594
You're at 165 over 90. Sweaty. Nauseous.
There's no shame in getting counseling.

532
00:35:35,594 --> 00:35:37,638
All right. Thank you. Appreciate you, brother.

533
00:35:37,638 --> 00:35:39,598
Mike, let the man do his job.

534
00:35:40,516 --> 00:35:41,934
Good job, man.

535
00:35:41,934 --> 00:35:43,435
Hey, Mike.

536
00:35:43,435 --> 00:35:45,354
What the hell you panicking about?

537
00:35:45,354 --> 00:35:46,813
I'm not speaking to you.

538
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:48,315
What'd I do?

539
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:52,110
You two all right?

540
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,820
Mike had a panic attack.

541
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,031
He didn't. Mike is fine.

542
00:35:56,031 --> 00:35:57,324
What happened?

543
00:35:57,324 --> 00:36:00,244
Rita, you ain't gonna believe this shit.
But we got a text--

544
00:36:00,244 --> 00:36:04,623
A tip. We got a tip
that Fletcher had violated his parole.

545
00:36:04,623 --> 00:36:06,583
So we came down here

546
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:09,837
and obviously he was into some shit
he ain't have no business.

547
00:36:09,837 --> 00:36:11,088
Is that true, Marcus?

548
00:36:15,384 --> 00:36:17,511
Well, you know I was with Mike.

549
00:36:19,263 --> 00:36:23,016
How could you, of all people,
think Captain Howard was dirty.

550
00:36:23,016 --> 00:36:24,685
I don't want this to be true.

551
00:36:24,685 --> 00:36:28,522
But it would benefit all of us to do our jobs
and follow the evidence.

552
00:36:28,522 --> 00:36:33,068
And you think he was stupid enough
to put accounts in his own name.

553
00:36:33,068 --> 00:36:35,696
- He's being framed.
- By who?

554
00:36:35,696 --> 00:36:37,531
That's what we're trying to find out.

555
00:36:37,531 --> 00:36:39,283
Rita, come on, you're smarter than this.

556
00:36:39,283 --> 00:36:42,077
Michael, please do not forget
you're talking to your boss.

557
00:36:42,995 --> 00:36:44,830
I'm trying to protect you here.

558
00:36:45,414 --> 00:36:47,875
I got no footage for a two-block radius.

559
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:49,084
What?

560
00:36:49,084 --> 00:36:52,212
They must've killed all CCTV, all security cams.

561
00:36:52,212 --> 00:36:53,297
I got nothing.

562
00:36:53,297 --> 00:36:56,175
At least they ain't film your panic attack.

563
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,761
Hey, guys.

564
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:03,015
- You had a panic attack?
- No.

565
00:37:03,015 --> 00:37:06,101
- If you want, I can recommend a good counselor.
- I'm good, Dorn. Thanks.

566
00:37:06,101 --> 00:37:08,979
Look, I shot this, went frame by frame.

567
00:37:10,355 --> 00:37:11,356
Check it out.

568
00:37:11,982 --> 00:37:13,317
All right. Not here.

569
00:37:14,109 --> 00:37:15,611
- Dorn, shut it down.
- Yeah.

570
00:37:15,611 --> 00:37:16,987
Hey. Let's go.

571
00:37:19,615 --> 00:37:21,366
So, what is this?

572
00:37:21,366 --> 00:37:22,743
We're not exactly sure.

573
00:37:24,536 --> 00:37:25,704
- Whoa.
- Wow.

574
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:27,164
There you go. There you go.

575
00:37:27,956 --> 00:37:31,293
<i>All right, you fucks. Now that I know it's you...</i>

576
00:37:31,835 --> 00:37:33,212
<i>here it is:</i>

577
00:37:33,921 --> 00:37:39,134
<i>I don't know how high up it goes,
but there's corrupt officials on our side.</i>

578
00:37:39,134 --> 00:37:40,844
<i>And they're working with the cartel.</i>

579
00:37:40,844 --> 00:37:44,014
<i>This all started smelling funny
about nine years ago.</i>

580
00:37:44,014 --> 00:37:46,808
<i>That shipment of coke
we were about to raid went missing.</i>

581
00:37:46,808 --> 00:37:49,436
<i>You know, I kept getting shut down
from above.</i>

582
00:37:49,436 --> 00:37:53,649
<i>So I pulled Sanchez and Ruiz
outta retirement.</i>

583
00:37:53,649 --> 00:37:56,276
<i>I had 'em working on the outside,
you know?</i>

584
00:37:56,276 --> 00:37:58,946
<i>They were killed in a car crash
a week later.</i>

585
00:37:58,946 --> 00:38:00,656
<i>That shook me up.</i>

586
00:38:00,656 --> 00:38:03,367
<i>And it's why I never brought you two in.</i>

587
00:38:03,367 --> 00:38:07,246
<i>Well, shame on me for worrying about your asses
when you coulda saved mine.</i>

588
00:38:07,246 --> 00:38:09,498
<i>But now it's up to you.</i>

589
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,626
<i>Remember the bust back in 2003?</i>

590
00:38:12,626 --> 00:38:16,088
<i>314 pounds of ecstasy?</i>

591
00:38:16,088 --> 00:38:20,092
<i>Well, I held onto the storage unit,
off the books.</i>

592
00:38:20,092 --> 00:38:21,969
<i>That's where the real files are.</i>

593
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:24,680
<i>Everything you need
to exterminate these rat fucks.</i>

594
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,806
<i>It's in there!</i>

595
00:38:25,806 --> 00:38:28,392
<i>You're gonna have to finish
what I couldn't.</i>

596
00:38:28,392 --> 00:38:29,810
<i>Please.</i>

597
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,395
<i>Please, boys.</i>

598
00:38:31,979 --> 00:38:33,480
<i>You're my last hope.</i>

599
00:38:37,276 --> 00:38:38,569
2003.

600
00:38:40,195 --> 00:38:42,322
That was the Haitians. Zoe Pound.

601
00:38:45,117 --> 00:38:46,910
Where was their storage locker?

602
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,620
I have no idea.

603
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:52,875
All right. We need you guys to go down
to the station and pull our original case files.

604
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:54,418
That'll tell us where the locker is.

605
00:38:54,418 --> 00:38:58,130
Do it quietly and be careful.
We don't know who we can trust.

606
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:00,132
Shit, this is heavy, man.

607
00:39:01,133 --> 00:39:03,135
I just got something important to say.

608
00:39:03,135 --> 00:39:05,053
I'm just gonna come out with it.
Clear the air.

609
00:39:05,053 --> 00:39:06,972
The rat is not me.

610
00:39:08,891 --> 00:39:10,517
Thanks for that, Dorn.

611
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,730
I feel safer.

612
00:40:53,036 --> 00:40:55,539
<i>They just tried to kill my son.</i>

613
00:40:55,539 --> 00:40:58,876
Because Armando can prove
that Captain Howard was innocent.

614
00:40:58,876 --> 00:41:01,044
Cap was onto these dirty players.

615
00:41:01,044 --> 00:41:02,504
Armando told you that?

616
00:41:02,504 --> 00:41:05,424
Yes. It's the reason
they wanted Captain Howard dead.

617
00:41:05,424 --> 00:41:08,135
Armando can ID the guy
that ordered the hit on Cap.

618
00:41:08,135 --> 00:41:09,219
He have a name?

619
00:41:10,137 --> 00:41:12,514
No. But a face.

620
00:41:13,473 --> 00:41:16,101
Listen, I know y'all can do this. All right?

621
00:41:16,101 --> 00:41:20,981
Just transfer Armando. Get him to Miami.
Get him to a secure location.

622
00:41:20,981 --> 00:41:24,651
We'll debrief him. We'll get his testimony.
We'll get some pictures in front of him.

623
00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:26,653
But please do it now.

624
00:41:26,653 --> 00:41:30,240
These guys are tryin' to cover their asses
and they are not gonna stop.

625
00:41:32,492 --> 00:41:33,952
Do it for Captain Howard.

626
00:41:36,872 --> 00:41:40,167
Look, the evidence against
Captain Howard is overwhelming.

627
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:42,628
If I'm doing this, I'm doing it for you.

628
00:41:45,589 --> 00:41:48,300
All right, let's transfer Aretas.

629
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:52,346
You'll accompany him,
get him to igloo here in Miami, do a debrief.

630
00:41:52,346 --> 00:41:55,182
But I'm sticking my neck out
and I'm trusting you.

631
00:41:56,099 --> 00:41:58,894
If he turns out to be bullshit,
then it's gonna be my ass.

632
00:41:59,811 --> 00:42:02,481
So don't screw me, Mike.

633
00:42:07,402 --> 00:42:08,570
Thank you.

634
00:42:09,196 --> 00:42:10,322
Thank you.

635
00:42:12,574 --> 00:42:13,700
Yeah?

636
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,869
<i>We found Zoe Pound's storage unit.</i>

637
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:18,705
<i>We'll go get the files then take them
to my houseboat for safekeeping.</i>

638
00:42:19,373 --> 00:42:22,084
All right, stay on it.
Let me know when you got it.

639
00:42:37,641 --> 00:42:41,186
Please surrender your firearms.
They will be returned to you upon touchdown.

640
00:42:56,785 --> 00:42:57,870
You good?

641
00:42:59,162 --> 00:43:00,289
Never been better.

642
00:43:00,289 --> 00:43:01,999
It's about 45 minutes.

643
00:43:08,755 --> 00:43:10,883
Mike, I wasn't even gonna tell you this...

644
00:43:10,883 --> 00:43:13,719
but in one
of our previous lifetimes together...

645
00:43:15,053 --> 00:43:16,638
you were a donkey.

646
00:43:16,638 --> 00:43:18,140
And I owned you.

647
00:43:19,558 --> 00:43:21,393
You were a stubborn ass, Mike.

648
00:43:21,393 --> 00:43:23,979
You used to bite and spit.

649
00:43:23,979 --> 00:43:25,647
You were nasty.

650
00:43:25,647 --> 00:43:30,569
But I was a terrible owner,
you know, because I used to beat you.

651
00:43:31,445 --> 00:43:33,447
Because you wouldn't listen for shit.

652
00:43:33,947 --> 00:43:36,867
And maybe I beat
some kind of shame into you, Mike.

653
00:43:36,867 --> 00:43:40,495
And now I realize
I was scarring your soul.

654
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,664
You miss your nap?

655
00:43:43,916 --> 00:43:46,627
Mike, I'm trying to apologize to you.

656
00:43:46,627 --> 00:43:49,963
We don't have your blankie,
but you could just rest your eyes.

657
00:43:49,963 --> 00:43:52,799
- That's exactly how you was as a donkey.
- Mm-kay.

658
00:43:52,799 --> 00:43:54,927
- That's that shit there.
- I get it.

659
00:43:54,927 --> 00:43:56,720
You need some help with your seat belt?

660
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,305
No, Donkey.

661
00:44:00,891 --> 00:44:04,228
Hey. Bryant, this is Bronson.

662
00:44:04,228 --> 00:44:06,605
Other guys are on turnaround.

663
00:44:06,605 --> 00:44:07,898
Take a seat.

664
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,129
What's up?

665
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:49,857
Read the lines.

666
00:44:49,857 --> 00:44:53,026
"US Marshal flight 724,
we have an emergency.

667
00:44:53,026 --> 00:44:57,573
Our prisoner has escaped custody
with the aid of Miami PD Lowrey and Burnett.

668
00:44:57,573 --> 00:44:58,740
There are officers down.

669
00:44:59,449 --> 00:45:01,493
{\an8}Mayday, mayday.
They are coming for the cockpit.

670
00:45:01,493 --> 00:45:04,371
I repeat, they are hijacking the CH-47.

671
00:45:04,371 --> 00:45:06,582
All ground units please respond."

672
00:45:19,428 --> 00:45:21,638
- Give me Lowrey's gun.
- Copy.

673
00:45:33,025 --> 00:45:34,109
Go, go!

674
00:45:34,109 --> 00:45:35,319
Get Lowrey.

675
00:45:39,156 --> 00:45:40,157
Let's go!

676
00:46:06,642 --> 00:46:08,560
We welcome the storm, motherfu--!

677
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:53,730
Get me out of this fucking cage!

678
00:46:54,231 --> 00:46:55,941
Marcus!

679
00:46:57,568 --> 00:46:58,569
Mike!

680
00:47:17,379 --> 00:47:18,630
It's too heavy!

681
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:20,048
Don't let go!

682
00:48:00,631 --> 00:48:02,090
Grab the stick!

683
00:48:04,843 --> 00:48:06,595
Where the hell you learn how to fly?!

684
00:48:08,013 --> 00:48:10,599
I'm a drug dealer, man. To the right!

685
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:56,520
He was using my gun.

686
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:59,022
How the hell
did they get on a federal transport?

687
00:49:00,023 --> 00:49:01,525
We need to split up.

688
00:49:01,525 --> 00:49:03,318
We're gonna stay together.

689
00:49:03,318 --> 00:49:04,695
Says who?

690
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:08,115
I'm not asking you.

691
00:49:08,115 --> 00:49:10,242
I'm telling you.
We're stayin' together.

692
00:49:10,242 --> 00:49:11,618
Fuck outta my way.

693
00:49:11,743 --> 00:49:14,121
- Hey. Where--?
- Get the fuck off me.

694
00:49:14,121 --> 00:49:15,706
Hey! Hey!

695
00:49:15,706 --> 00:49:16,790
Look.

696
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:21,461
You are the only person
who can identify whoever is doing this!

697
00:49:21,461 --> 00:49:26,550
The only way that any of us stays alive
is if we get them before they get us.

698
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:29,261
There's no us! There is no us!

699
00:49:29,261 --> 00:49:30,762
Damn.

700
00:49:30,762 --> 00:49:32,848
That Lowrey DNA is a bitch.

701
00:49:32,848 --> 00:49:34,766
Y'all some strong motherfuckers.

702
00:49:36,185 --> 00:49:40,522
Okay. Now, look, everybody unflex.
On three.

703
00:49:40,522 --> 00:49:42,441
One! Two!

704
00:49:43,275 --> 00:49:44,359
There you go.

705
00:49:45,444 --> 00:49:50,657
Captain Howard left us files
that's gonna tell us who's doin' this.

706
00:49:51,408 --> 00:49:52,784
Dorn has 'em.

707
00:49:52,784 --> 00:49:54,661
We just have to get back to Miami.

708
00:49:56,747 --> 00:49:58,498
You better not slow me down.

709
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,919
Lose your phones.

710
00:50:01,919 --> 00:50:04,129
You keep up with me
or I leave you in the dirt.

711
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,548
You're in my world now.

712
00:50:20,145 --> 00:50:22,648
Hey, Mike.
Look, we gotta think about this.

713
00:50:22,648 --> 00:50:26,944
I know you wanna move with him,
you know, because he's your "son."

714
00:50:26,944 --> 00:50:29,780
Whoa, whoa. Don't air quote that.

715
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:33,033
No, I didn't. I'm just sayin'
I know why you tryin' to protect him.

716
00:50:33,033 --> 00:50:34,243
'Cause he "family."

717
00:50:34,243 --> 00:50:39,248
Hey. Movin' the air quotes down to your hips
doesn't un-air-quote them.

718
00:50:39,248 --> 00:50:41,291
Just say he's my son.

719
00:50:41,291 --> 00:50:43,335
- He's your son.
- No, no.

720
00:50:43,335 --> 00:50:47,589
Palms up is like you tryin' to say,
oh, he's not really my son.

721
00:50:48,549 --> 00:50:51,635
Oh. Well, your son's gettin' away.

722
00:50:51,635 --> 00:50:52,928
Shit.

723
00:51:01,645 --> 00:51:04,857
If your men are on some kind of op,
you might wanna pull us in.

724
00:51:04,857 --> 00:51:06,525
Otherwise, it doesn't look good for them.

725
00:51:08,986 --> 00:51:10,070
Judy.

726
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:13,073
- You ID the bodies?
- Roger. We got three unaccounted for.

727
00:51:13,073 --> 00:51:15,200
Lowrey, Burnett and Aretas.

728
00:51:16,285 --> 00:51:18,787
Motherfuckers. Fucking--!

729
00:51:18,787 --> 00:51:19,955
Shit.

730
00:51:20,706 --> 00:51:22,499
All right. Listen up!

731
00:51:22,499 --> 00:51:25,961
We have three suspects,
armed and dangerous, out there.

732
00:51:26,753 --> 00:51:28,422
And I want them back.

733
00:51:29,006 --> 00:51:30,257
Let's go!

734
00:51:31,258 --> 00:51:32,718
Hold on. Judy.

735
00:51:32,718 --> 00:51:34,595
<i>Three</i> suspects?

736
00:51:34,595 --> 00:51:36,346
What do you think is happening here?

737
00:51:37,598 --> 00:51:38,932
What do you think?

738
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:41,518
Play the audio.

739
00:51:42,144 --> 00:51:45,480
<i>US Marshal flight 724,
we have an emergency.</i>

740
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:49,318
<i>Our prisoner has escaped custody
with the aid of Miami PD Lowrey and Burnett.</i>

741
00:51:49,318 --> 00:51:51,528
<i>There are officers down.
Mayday, mayday.</i>

742
00:51:51,528 --> 00:51:55,532
Come on, you can't possibly believe
Mike and Marcus would do this.

743
00:51:55,532 --> 00:51:59,453
Nah, you said it. Lowrey was obsessed
with getting his son out of prison.

744
00:51:59,453 --> 00:52:01,121
Slow down, Judy.

745
00:52:01,705 --> 00:52:03,540
This isn't Miami, Secada.

746
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:07,211
These are my fugitives
and right now the whole world is my jurisdiction.

747
00:52:07,211 --> 00:52:09,713
You've known them your whole life.
How can you even suggest--?

748
00:52:09,713 --> 00:52:12,341
Do I think
that Mike and Marcus planned this?

749
00:52:13,008 --> 00:52:14,426
Probably not.

750
00:52:14,426 --> 00:52:17,137
But people do things
they wouldn't normally do when family's involved.

751
00:52:17,137 --> 00:52:19,598
In my experience innocent men don't run.

752
00:52:19,598 --> 00:52:23,268
- Can we stop and think before--
- Are you capable of doing your job?

753
00:52:23,268 --> 00:52:24,770
'Cause I need to move on.

754
00:52:30,234 --> 00:52:31,527
They survived.

755
00:52:32,027 --> 00:52:33,570
What the fuck you mean, they survived?

756
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:37,157
No bodies on site.
US Marshals are treating it as a manhunt.

757
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:41,328
These guys just refuse to die.

758
00:52:43,288 --> 00:52:44,289
They're wanted men.

759
00:52:45,123 --> 00:52:47,876
<i>Law enforcement and media
are our friends now.</i>

760
00:52:47,876 --> 00:52:49,586
<i>A manhunt for three fugitives</i>

761
00:52:49,586 --> 00:52:51,588
{\an8}<i>is sending shock waves across South Florida.</i>

762
00:52:51,588 --> 00:52:54,299
<i>Ballistic reports have matched the bullets
recovered from the bodies...</i>

763
00:52:54,299 --> 00:52:57,970
Are you planning on dropping out
of the mayor's race in light of the recent events?

764
00:52:57,970 --> 00:52:59,805
<i>The manhunt is currently underway.</i>

765
00:52:59,805 --> 00:53:04,059
{\an8}<i>The FBI is assisting US Marshals
in bringing these men in.</i>

766
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:09,898
<i>Lowrey, Burnett and Aretas should be
considered armed and dangerous.</i>

767
00:53:09,898 --> 00:53:14,319
{\an8}<i>These are individuals who have killed
fellow law enforcement professionals.</i>

768
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:17,531
<i>If you see something, say something.</i>

769
00:53:18,115 --> 00:53:19,950
Put a bounty on the streets.

770
00:53:20,701 --> 00:53:23,620
<i>Get it to every gang in the city
and let them fight for it.</i>

771
00:53:26,957 --> 00:53:28,375
Five mil.

772
00:53:29,334 --> 00:53:31,295
<i>Let's go get these motherfuckers.</i>

773
00:53:40,304 --> 00:53:42,514
The universe is crazy, ain't it?

774
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:44,641
Look at us.

775
00:53:45,309 --> 00:53:49,146
I bet none of us thought when we woke up today
this is where we'd be.

776
00:53:49,938 --> 00:53:51,732
You outta jail.

777
00:53:51,732 --> 00:53:53,609
We goin' to jail.

778
00:53:54,443 --> 00:53:56,278
This shit is special.

779
00:53:56,987 --> 00:53:57,988
Mike?

780
00:53:58,739 --> 00:54:01,742
Is there anything
you would like to say to Armando?

781
00:54:01,742 --> 00:54:03,327
Fuck you talkin' to me like that? No.

782
00:54:03,327 --> 00:54:07,122
Mike, this is a moment.
Express with your son.

783
00:54:16,548 --> 00:54:17,549
I'm sorry.

784
00:54:17,549 --> 00:54:20,761
That's what I'm talking about.

785
00:54:20,761 --> 00:54:23,305
- For what?
- For everything, man.

786
00:54:23,931 --> 00:54:27,351
Seems like bad shit happens
to anybody I love, so...

787
00:54:28,143 --> 00:54:30,103
Startin' to think maybe I'm cursed.

788
00:54:30,103 --> 00:54:31,396
I just feel like...

789
00:54:32,356 --> 00:54:33,899
maybe I cursed you.

790
00:54:36,276 --> 00:54:37,611
You ain't fuckin' cursed me.

791
00:54:38,278 --> 00:54:40,030
Bad shit happens to everybody.

792
00:54:41,281 --> 00:54:42,658
Ain't always about you.

793
00:54:43,867 --> 00:54:44,910
Hey, Armando.

794
00:54:45,452 --> 00:54:49,456
I don't know if I told you this,
but I died a couple of weeks ago.

795
00:54:50,874 --> 00:54:52,042
Sorry to hear about that.

796
00:54:52,042 --> 00:54:54,920
Oh, no.
The best thing that ever happened to me.

797
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,338
Shit's wild.

798
00:54:56,338 --> 00:54:57,840
But y'all?

799
00:54:58,841 --> 00:55:00,509
Y'all the reason I came back.

800
00:55:00,509 --> 00:55:01,677
Hey.

801
00:55:02,261 --> 00:55:04,888
Everybody, bring it in.

802
00:55:04,888 --> 00:55:07,724
Come on, bring it in. Come on.

803
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:09,768
What?

804
00:55:10,519 --> 00:55:11,854
There you go, Armando.

805
00:55:12,396 --> 00:55:14,106
There you go. There you--

806
00:55:14,106 --> 00:55:16,650
Y'all are some terrible fuckin' fugitives.

807
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:21,947
So, what are you, fuckin' Marcus Winfrey?

808
00:55:21,947 --> 00:55:23,532
- What?
- Now, see?

809
00:55:23,532 --> 00:55:26,201
You makin' us look soft,
like we don't know how to be on the run.

810
00:55:39,631 --> 00:55:41,091
Better get you out of this.

811
00:55:42,509 --> 00:55:43,510
Hey!

812
00:55:44,219 --> 00:55:46,847
- That boy hardheaded.
- Chip off the old block.

813
00:56:06,533 --> 00:56:08,827
Well, what we got here?

814
00:56:10,329 --> 00:56:12,206
Hey, Cain, come take a look at this!

815
00:56:13,749 --> 00:56:15,292
What are you boys doin'?

816
00:56:15,292 --> 00:56:16,793
"Boys"?

817
00:56:16,793 --> 00:56:19,254
- Are y'all stealing our clothes?
- Looks like it.

818
00:56:19,254 --> 00:56:20,923
Fuckin' racism.

819
00:56:22,007 --> 00:56:24,968
Y'all think just because we Black
we stealin' your shit?

820
00:56:24,968 --> 00:56:27,304
Now, these are my own Black clothes

821
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:31,850
that I put on today
from my own Black closet.

822
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:33,060
- Marcus!
- What?

823
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:34,228
Look at your shirt.

824
00:56:41,652 --> 00:56:43,070
How'd this get in my Black closet?

825
00:56:44,071 --> 00:56:47,074
Why don't you boys
sing us a little Reba song.

826
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:51,912
- Reba?
- Reba? Oh, yeah.

827
00:56:52,788 --> 00:56:54,081
Oh, please.

828
00:56:55,249 --> 00:56:57,626
That's-- 'Cause he put...
He put me on to Reb--

829
00:56:57,626 --> 00:56:59,795
Which one? Which y'all--? Which one?

830
00:56:59,795 --> 00:57:01,213
Sing your favorite.

831
00:57:01,964 --> 00:57:05,425
- Oh, she got plenty of them.
- 'Cause she got hits.

832
00:57:05,551 --> 00:57:09,304
- Was it the up-tempo song? Or the slow jam?
- Yeah, yeah, remember the one?

833
00:57:09,304 --> 00:57:12,057
- It was the slow one, nigga.
- Oh, okay.

834
00:57:12,057 --> 00:57:15,143
<i>- You hurt me in the morning</i>
- Yes, 'cause she was hurt.

835
00:57:15,269 --> 00:57:17,437
<i>- You hurt me at night</i>
- Yes, yes.

836
00:57:17,563 --> 00:57:19,940
<i>- But I've changed
- Changed</i>

837
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:22,025
<i>And I'm strong
I'm a woman</i>

838
00:57:22,025 --> 00:57:23,318
<i>I'm a strong Black wom--</i>

839
00:57:23,443 --> 00:57:24,736
<i>I'm a strong woman</i>

840
00:57:24,862 --> 00:57:26,864
Yeah, 'cause she's not Black.

841
00:57:29,408 --> 00:57:30,701
And then...

842
00:57:30,701 --> 00:57:32,452
<i>What you gonna do?</i>

843
00:57:32,578 --> 00:57:34,162
<i>What you gonna d--?</i>

844
00:57:35,163 --> 00:57:36,832
That ain't no Reba song.

845
00:57:37,749 --> 00:57:39,251
It's from her mixtape.

846
00:57:47,885 --> 00:57:49,344
Goddamn it!

847
00:57:51,889 --> 00:57:53,765
We're sorry! We'll bring it back!

848
00:57:53,891 --> 00:57:56,685
We're not stealing your shit
because we Black!

849
00:58:10,616 --> 00:58:12,326
Did you ever love her?

850
00:58:14,369 --> 00:58:15,662
What?

851
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:18,332
My mother. You ever love her?

852
00:58:19,374 --> 00:58:21,210
He's expressing.

853
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,546
I definitely loved her.

854
00:58:25,088 --> 00:58:26,673
And then you sold her out.

855
00:58:27,716 --> 00:58:29,009
I made some mistakes.

856
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:30,636
Like me.

857
00:58:30,636 --> 00:58:34,348
- You know that is not what I was trying--
- Now wait a damn minute, Armando.

858
00:58:34,348 --> 00:58:36,058
He's trying to make up for it.

859
00:58:36,058 --> 00:58:37,851
He don't owe you a damn thing.

860
00:58:37,851 --> 00:58:41,355
All right, hold on. Hold on, Marcus.
You're just... You're being aggressive.

861
00:58:41,355 --> 00:58:44,399
I've been a dad a long time.
He needs to hear this, Mike.

862
00:58:44,399 --> 00:58:46,151
He needs some tough-ass love.

863
00:58:46,151 --> 00:58:50,531
Armando.
Maybe he does owe you something. Okay?

864
00:58:50,531 --> 00:58:52,449
Your mom being deceived by him.

865
00:58:52,449 --> 00:58:56,370
You being born in prison,
in a web of lies

866
00:58:56,370 --> 00:59:00,832
that turned your ass
into a stone-cold fuckin' killer.

867
00:59:02,251 --> 00:59:04,169
Yeah. You're a killer.

868
00:59:06,129 --> 00:59:10,634
But this man, through it all,
has been nothing but solid.

869
00:59:13,095 --> 00:59:15,347
That's some
father-of-the-year shit right there.

870
00:59:15,347 --> 00:59:16,682
Is it?

871
00:59:20,227 --> 00:59:22,396
Your wack-ass parenting broke the truck.

872
00:59:23,063 --> 00:59:24,356
My bad.

873
00:59:25,524 --> 00:59:27,192
Yeah, nah, that's dead.

874
00:59:27,192 --> 00:59:28,652
We're not far from Tabitha's.

875
00:59:28,652 --> 00:59:30,863
No, Mike. You know that woman's crazy.

876
00:59:30,863 --> 00:59:32,447
Yeah, but she likes me.

877
00:59:32,447 --> 00:59:34,658
I don't think she likes you
as much as you think.

878
00:59:34,658 --> 00:59:37,369
- The Pony's about two miles from here.
- What's The Pony?

879
00:59:47,671 --> 00:59:52,301
I need my Instagram.
I need my Friendster. I need more sex.

880
00:59:52,301 --> 00:59:54,595
I need more men in this club.

881
00:59:54,595 --> 00:59:56,972
You all look beautiful.
Now get back to work.

882
00:59:57,890 --> 01:00:00,559
Mike Lowrey. Damn.

883
01:00:00,684 --> 01:00:01,727
What up, Tabitha?

884
01:00:04,146 --> 01:00:05,439
So y'all in trouble, huh?

885
01:00:05,439 --> 01:00:07,649
Yeah, we need some help.

886
01:00:07,649 --> 01:00:09,610
- We need some clothes.
- No shit.

887
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:11,403
A ride and some phones.

888
01:00:11,403 --> 01:00:13,197
Yeah. Guns too.

889
01:00:14,072 --> 01:00:16,408
That's my son. That's Armando.

890
01:00:16,408 --> 01:00:18,160
You got you a little Spanish son?

891
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,412
Yeah, it's a long story.

892
01:00:21,121 --> 01:00:22,206
Can you hook us up?

893
01:00:23,165 --> 01:00:25,834
I mean, I got all that
but what you gonna do for me?

894
01:00:25,834 --> 01:00:27,794
What you mean? We good for that.

895
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,171
You were.

896
01:00:29,796 --> 01:00:32,216
But you guys
are men on the run now, so...

897
01:00:32,216 --> 01:00:33,675
Well, what you need?

898
01:00:33,675 --> 01:00:35,093
What I need?

899
01:00:36,803 --> 01:00:38,597
I need you to eat this pussy.

900
01:00:42,267 --> 01:00:43,769
I'm not doin' that, all right?

901
01:00:43,769 --> 01:00:47,105
Whoa, hold on, Mike, hold on.
Think about this.

902
01:00:47,105 --> 01:00:49,942
Now, you say guns and phones, right?

903
01:00:50,776 --> 01:00:53,195
Okay, well, look,
you know Mike's a married man.

904
01:00:53,195 --> 01:00:54,279
So?

905
01:00:54,279 --> 01:00:56,823
So he's gonna need
some plausible deniability.

906
01:00:56,823 --> 01:01:00,827
So I'mma have you lay down
and stick out your tongue.

907
01:01:00,827 --> 01:01:02,663
And you gonna have to do the rest.

908
01:01:02,788 --> 01:01:04,373
I can fuck with that.

909
01:01:04,498 --> 01:01:07,125
- Oh, yeah, go on, baby.
- No, Marcus.

910
01:01:07,125 --> 01:01:10,504
- All you gotta do is close your eyes, Mike.
- No!

911
01:01:10,504 --> 01:01:13,298
I'mma need pictures.
You know how to take pictures, right?

912
01:01:13,298 --> 01:01:16,760
Hey. We don't have a lot of time.
I need you to stop fuckin' around.

913
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,303
Oh, I'm not fuckin' around.

914
01:01:18,303 --> 01:01:19,763
All right, hey, let's go.

915
01:01:19,763 --> 01:01:21,014
Wait, hold up.

916
01:01:21,014 --> 01:01:23,600
Sit your motherfuckin' ass down.

917
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,853
- Hey, Tabitha, what is you doin'?
- What is <i>you</i> doin'?!

918
01:01:25,853 --> 01:01:29,189
Sit your married ass down!
You get y'all asses down too!

919
01:01:29,189 --> 01:01:30,858
- Shit.
- Everybody sit down.

920
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:34,069
Hey, I got the bad boys right here.
Let's get that money.

921
01:01:34,069 --> 01:01:36,697
- Hey, Tab.
- Shut the fuck up.

922
01:01:36,697 --> 01:01:39,241
Hold up, I'm confused.

923
01:01:39,241 --> 01:01:40,993
You didn't want him to licky-licky?

924
01:01:40,993 --> 01:01:43,245
There's a $5 million bounty on your head.

925
01:01:43,245 --> 01:01:45,330
I need that money. I was just stalling.

926
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:48,542
That's... That's cold. He almost did that shit.

927
01:01:48,542 --> 01:01:49,877
He did not, Marcus.

928
01:01:49,877 --> 01:01:52,045
I told you she didn't like you.

929
01:01:52,045 --> 01:01:53,422
Get the fuck up.

930
01:01:59,303 --> 01:02:01,221
The bounty is dead or alive.

931
01:02:02,014 --> 01:02:03,307
Don't be stupid.

932
01:02:06,852 --> 01:02:08,020
Hey, Armando.

933
01:02:08,145 --> 01:02:10,230
If you live, I'll let you...

934
01:02:11,523 --> 01:02:12,524
What?

935
01:02:12,524 --> 01:02:15,319
I said if you live, motherfucker,
holler at me.

936
01:02:17,196 --> 01:02:18,614
He was kinda cute.

937
01:02:21,992 --> 01:02:23,076
We got a tip.

938
01:02:23,911 --> 01:02:25,913
Positive ID on our fugitives.

939
01:02:25,913 --> 01:02:27,539
Let's do this.

940
01:02:33,462 --> 01:02:36,131
Mike, I'm about to make my move.

941
01:02:36,131 --> 01:02:39,218
No, the fuck you're not.
You about to go wherever these men are taking us.

942
01:02:39,343 --> 01:02:40,552
Oh, I'm not goin'.

943
01:02:40,552 --> 01:02:44,056
Now I'll take the three in the front,
you take the six in the back.

944
01:02:44,056 --> 01:02:46,433
Marcus, we do not have any weapons.

945
01:02:46,433 --> 01:02:50,354
In five... four... three...

946
01:02:50,354 --> 01:02:51,688
Fuck!

947
01:03:11,208 --> 01:03:13,502
Ah, shit! This motherfucker.

948
01:03:13,502 --> 01:03:16,129
<i>Fuckboy, fuckboy
Whatcha gonna do?</i>

949
01:03:16,129 --> 01:03:17,631
Ayo, Mike!

950
01:03:17,631 --> 01:03:20,133
Ain't no fun
when the rabbit got the gun, huh?

951
01:03:20,133 --> 01:03:21,552
Wait, you know this guy?

952
01:03:21,552 --> 01:03:23,762
Yeah, I hit him with a hammer
a couple years ago.

953
01:03:23,762 --> 01:03:27,933
You think I forgot about that fucking ho shit
you pulled off at Manny's Prime Rib?

954
01:03:27,933 --> 01:03:29,935
How the fuck
did I let you two catch me?

955
01:03:30,435 --> 01:03:31,895
Mike, I want my five million.

956
01:03:32,437 --> 01:03:33,438
Marcus!

957
01:03:34,106 --> 01:03:36,316
You see I got the fam with me.
The streets!

958
01:03:36,316 --> 01:03:39,528
We could do this nice and easy
or we can go to war!

959
01:03:39,528 --> 01:03:40,904
'Cause I'm fucking war-ready!

960
01:03:41,613 --> 01:03:43,240
What are you doing?!

961
01:03:45,075 --> 01:03:46,076
No!

962
01:03:56,503 --> 01:03:58,463
Go, go, go, go!

963
01:04:03,427 --> 01:04:05,095
Back up! Back up! Back up!

964
01:04:09,975 --> 01:04:11,393
No! No!

965
01:04:11,393 --> 01:04:14,771
Windshield wiper fluid is flammable!

966
01:04:14,771 --> 01:04:18,483
How the hell am I supposed to know that?!
I ain't no damn scientist!

967
01:04:23,697 --> 01:04:26,783
Everybody relax.
The fire's on the outside.

968
01:04:29,661 --> 01:04:30,746
Oh, shit!

969
01:04:30,746 --> 01:04:32,456
Now it's on the inside!

970
01:04:35,792 --> 01:04:36,793
Shit!

971
01:04:36,793 --> 01:04:37,961
Okay.

972
01:04:40,088 --> 01:04:41,173
Okay.

973
01:05:10,786 --> 01:05:13,664
Everybody out! Everybody out!

974
01:05:40,899 --> 01:05:42,234
Shit.

975
01:05:55,289 --> 01:05:56,748
Open the damn door!

976
01:05:59,751 --> 01:06:02,129
We can feel you right there, boy.
Open the door.

977
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:11,221
Hey!

978
01:06:11,221 --> 01:06:13,056
Open up, Muscle Milk.

979
01:06:13,056 --> 01:06:14,933
Come on, man.
What the fuck is you doing?

980
01:06:14,933 --> 01:06:17,811
Nothing. It's just not a great time
for me right now, guys.

981
01:06:17,811 --> 01:06:19,313
It's not a great time for us either.

982
01:06:19,313 --> 01:06:21,190
Okay, let's reconvene
in like an hour or so.

983
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:23,150
Babe, we're out of body wash.

984
01:06:24,151 --> 01:06:25,569
What the hell?

985
01:06:26,778 --> 01:06:27,988
We found you guys.

986
01:06:29,948 --> 01:06:31,533
We're in a relationship. Okay?

987
01:06:32,451 --> 01:06:33,660
- Oh, okay.
- All right.

988
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:35,245
Sneaking around has been destroying me.

989
01:06:35,245 --> 01:06:38,624
It started about a couple months ago.
It will not affect our professional lives.

990
01:06:38,624 --> 01:06:40,501
Except for that one time in that van.

991
01:06:40,501 --> 01:06:43,337
- I am not sorry.
- Nothing to be sorry about.

992
01:06:43,337 --> 01:06:45,923
Yeah, you know.
I mean, people do that shit.

993
01:06:45,923 --> 01:06:48,509
- Are you guys okay?
- Yeah, we're good. I wanted to--

994
01:06:50,552 --> 01:06:52,513
- What the fuck?!
- Okay. Whoa, whoa.

995
01:06:52,513 --> 01:06:54,640
Hey, Kelly. Kelly.

996
01:06:55,224 --> 01:06:57,726
I asked you to wait outside for a second.

997
01:06:57,726 --> 01:07:00,354
All right. Kelly, he's with us.

998
01:07:00,354 --> 01:07:01,688
He can't be here.

999
01:07:01,688 --> 01:07:03,649
This is my son, Armando.

1000
01:07:03,649 --> 01:07:06,777
I know who he is,
and that's why he can't be here.

1001
01:07:06,777 --> 01:07:10,197
I trust you with my life, Mike.
But I as sure as shit don't trust him.

1002
01:07:10,197 --> 01:07:11,490
I trust him.

1003
01:07:11,490 --> 01:07:13,575
Then take him to your house.

1004
01:07:14,952 --> 01:07:17,287
Hey, Mike.
Can I have a second with her, please?

1005
01:07:17,287 --> 01:07:18,622
Yeah, yeah. Please.

1006
01:07:18,622 --> 01:07:20,582
- Hey, sweetie.
- Relax. Relax.

1007
01:07:20,582 --> 01:07:22,292
Come here for a sec.
Come over here for a second.

1008
01:07:25,671 --> 01:07:27,339
We could both end up in jail.

1009
01:07:31,468 --> 01:07:34,555
- Give him a chance.
- Yeah, give him a chance to kill us all?

1010
01:07:35,097 --> 01:07:37,599
This is some dysfunctional shit.

1011
01:07:40,435 --> 01:07:42,896
- She's fine.
- She don't look fine.

1012
01:07:42,896 --> 01:07:44,940
- I'm fine.
- Yes, you are.

1013
01:07:46,108 --> 01:07:47,901
- The fuck you say?
- All right, all right.

1014
01:07:47,901 --> 01:07:50,904
- It's the language barrier.
- It was English.

1015
01:07:51,488 --> 01:07:52,573
It was definitely English.

1016
01:07:58,579 --> 01:07:59,621
Thanks for the drip.

1017
01:08:00,539 --> 01:08:02,791
Yeah. Okay, we're aggregating all the data.

1018
01:08:02,791 --> 01:08:06,044
There's over 100 hours of video,
200 units of audio.

1019
01:08:06,044 --> 01:08:09,673
We're indexing all audio, video
and geo-located IP network data

1020
01:08:09,673 --> 01:08:12,301
to create a sight picture
and develop a target package.

1021
01:08:12,301 --> 01:08:15,512
Basically, you sifting through all this shit
to find the guilty motherfucker.

1022
01:08:15,512 --> 01:08:16,763
Bingo.

1023
01:08:17,471 --> 01:08:18,557
Hey, Dorn.

1024
01:08:18,557 --> 01:08:22,810
Can you safely get me into my Ring app?
I wanna see my family.

1025
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:25,731
Yeah, we got our own VPN and router.
What's your username?

1026
01:08:25,731 --> 01:08:27,441
Marcus37.

1027
01:08:27,441 --> 01:08:28,942
And password?

1028
01:08:28,942 --> 01:08:30,944
Snickers89.

1029
01:08:38,118 --> 01:08:40,037
Almost home, baby.

1030
01:08:40,037 --> 01:08:42,372
Hey, let's get to work.
We got a lot to get through here.

1031
01:08:42,372 --> 01:08:44,291
So, what exactly are we looking for?

1032
01:08:44,875 --> 01:08:47,085
<i>We're looking for the guy
who ordered the hit on Cap.</i>

1033
01:08:47,627 --> 01:08:48,962
<i>Armando can ID him.</i>

1034
01:08:55,301 --> 01:08:58,013
<i>This fucking bastard has been my white whale.</i>

1035
01:08:58,013 --> 01:09:02,309
<i>For the last nine years,
I've been trying to harpoon the son of a bitch.</i>

1036
01:09:02,309 --> 01:09:04,520
<i>But now it's up to you.</i>

1037
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:26,875
Ey-Ey-Ey. Do I walk into your house
and show you how to make cocaine?

1038
01:09:26,875 --> 01:09:28,210
Blow it up.

1039
01:09:36,134 --> 01:09:37,176
It's him.

1040
01:09:43,642 --> 01:09:44,768
You sure?

1041
01:09:45,269 --> 01:09:46,937
That's the guy that ordered the hit.

1042
01:09:46,937 --> 01:09:48,397
Bam. Got a name.

1043
01:09:49,147 --> 01:09:52,317
James McGrath.
Army Ranger School, counterintelligence.

1044
01:09:52,317 --> 01:09:55,112
<i>Deployed in Mexico until 2005.</i>

1045
01:09:55,112 --> 01:09:57,948
Worked with the DEA,
Defense Attache's office.

1046
01:09:57,948 --> 01:09:59,533
Oh, shit.

1047
01:09:59,533 --> 01:10:03,120
He was taken hostage
by your friends, the cartel.

1048
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:06,164
He gave up his entire squad
"under duress."

1049
01:10:06,164 --> 01:10:07,541
It's called torture, man.

1050
01:10:08,458 --> 01:10:10,169
He was the only survivor.

1051
01:10:15,132 --> 01:10:16,800
<i>Cap had him the whole time.</i>

1052
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,385
He just didn't know it.

1053
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:23,015
Hello.

1054
01:10:23,015 --> 01:10:24,808
Hey. It's me.

1055
01:10:24,808 --> 01:10:27,811
Damn it, Michael. Where are you?

1056
01:10:27,811 --> 01:10:31,315
Rita, we're coming in.
We got proof that Captain Howard is innocent.

1057
01:10:32,107 --> 01:10:33,150
What proof?

1058
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:36,320
We got the guy
that had Captain Howard killed.

1059
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:37,613
<i>Armando ID'd him.</i>

1060
01:10:37,613 --> 01:10:40,824
<i>Same dude that attacked us
on the chopper. James McGrath.</i>

1061
01:10:40,824 --> 01:10:43,493
Rita, we got ten years' worth of files.

1062
01:10:43,493 --> 01:10:46,955
Cap was investigating these dudes.
We got 'em all. It's a whole network.

1063
01:10:46,955 --> 01:10:49,416
<i>We'll surrender to you tomorrow.</i>

1064
01:10:49,416 --> 01:10:51,126
<i>Hey, look, we gotta go.</i>

1065
01:10:51,126 --> 01:10:52,211
Michael, what--?

1066
01:10:56,006 --> 01:10:57,132
You okay?

1067
01:10:58,509 --> 01:11:00,052
They're coming in.

1068
01:11:00,052 --> 01:11:01,261
What?

1069
01:11:01,261 --> 01:11:05,349
Michael says they have proof
that exonerates Howard...

1070
01:11:05,349 --> 01:11:06,808
explains everything.

1071
01:11:09,353 --> 01:11:10,938
Do you still love him?

1072
01:11:11,730 --> 01:11:12,731
What?

1073
01:11:13,315 --> 01:11:14,358
No.

1074
01:11:15,025 --> 01:11:16,443
But I believe him.

1075
01:11:17,653 --> 01:11:19,238
Just be careful, babe.

1076
01:11:21,323 --> 01:11:22,574
Still going to dinner?

1077
01:11:22,574 --> 01:11:23,742
Yeah.

1078
01:11:27,871 --> 01:11:29,164
<i>They have the files.</i>

1079
01:11:29,164 --> 01:11:32,125
We need to make this look like cartel business.
Spanish only.

1080
01:11:36,255 --> 01:11:37,673
Ammo's ready to go. Let's go.

1081
01:11:48,725 --> 01:11:51,144
{\an8}We only need one hostage.

1082
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:53,188
Shit! Shit! Shit!

1083
01:11:54,398 --> 01:11:56,692
You guys! We got a problem.

1084
01:11:58,026 --> 01:12:01,071
Miami Central, Miami Central.
29 in progress.

1085
01:12:01,196 --> 01:12:03,323
Oh shit, that's my house.

1086
01:12:03,323 --> 01:12:05,576
Please advise, MOS residence.

1087
01:12:05,576 --> 01:12:06,952
Respond forthwith.

1088
01:12:06,952 --> 01:12:11,540
Fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, no.

1089
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:12,791
Come on, Christine.

1090
01:12:21,258 --> 01:12:22,759
- Shit.
- Get a unit over to my house.

1091
01:12:23,969 --> 01:12:26,221
Come on, Reggie! Pick up! Pick up.

1092
01:12:26,221 --> 01:12:28,432
Miami Central,
we have another 29 in progress.

1093
01:12:28,432 --> 01:12:31,435
Please send units
to Detective Lowrey's home address.

1094
01:12:32,311 --> 01:12:33,937
<i>Enemy's down!</i>

1095
01:12:34,605 --> 01:12:37,024
Reggie! You got incoming.

1096
01:12:37,024 --> 01:12:39,568
<i>- Get the family to somewhere safe.</i>
- What?

1097
01:12:39,693 --> 01:12:41,153
<i>- Now!</i>
- Yes, sir.

1098
01:12:44,907 --> 01:12:46,867
- What's happening?
- What's going on?

1099
01:12:46,867 --> 01:12:49,828
There's people comin' in the house.
I gotta keep y'all safe.

1100
01:12:54,374 --> 01:12:55,375
Please be careful!

1101
01:12:55,375 --> 01:12:57,336
- Okay, Reggie, what's happening? Okay.
- Trust me. I love you.

1102
01:12:57,878 --> 01:12:59,421
Fuck! Fuck!

1103
01:13:12,226 --> 01:13:13,644
Behind you, Reg!

1104
01:13:15,187 --> 01:13:16,396
Oh, damn!

1105
01:13:25,322 --> 01:13:28,033
- Who the fuck is this guy?!
- That's my boy! That's my boy!

1106
01:13:34,790 --> 01:13:36,583
Damn!

1107
01:13:37,334 --> 01:13:38,877
Come on, come on, come on.

1108
01:13:59,773 --> 01:14:01,233
No, no, no!

1109
01:14:03,151 --> 01:14:04,486
Holy shit!

1110
01:14:09,074 --> 01:14:10,242
Come on, come on!

1111
01:14:17,124 --> 01:14:18,417
Holy shit!

1112
01:14:24,089 --> 01:14:26,466
Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang, motherfuckers.

1113
01:14:26,466 --> 01:14:28,218
Me snacks is your snacks, Reggie.

1114
01:14:28,218 --> 01:14:29,678
<i>All right, come on.</i>

1115
01:14:33,390 --> 01:14:35,100
Mike, did you see that shit?

1116
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:36,768
Pick up the phone.

1117
01:14:37,769 --> 01:14:40,189
Whoa, Mike! Mike! Mike!

1118
01:14:46,278 --> 01:14:47,279
One second.

1119
01:14:52,201 --> 01:14:53,202
Callie.

1120
01:14:53,202 --> 01:14:55,662
I saw it on TV.
My mom is after Uncle Mike.

1121
01:14:55,662 --> 01:14:58,665
There is no way
that he did everything that they're saying.

1122
01:14:58,665 --> 01:14:59,875
Sweetheart.

1123
01:15:01,835 --> 01:15:04,129
Everything is going to be okay.

1124
01:15:04,129 --> 01:15:06,715
Okay? Okay?

1125
01:15:18,393 --> 01:15:20,312
- Hello?
- It's me. Get out of the house.

1126
01:15:21,188 --> 01:15:24,024
- I've got Callie with me.
- Take her and go! Get out now!

1127
01:15:26,443 --> 01:15:27,945
Callie, get behind me.

1128
01:15:29,655 --> 01:15:30,739
Mike.

1129
01:15:36,411 --> 01:15:37,704
Christine!

1130
01:15:47,589 --> 01:15:48,674
Mr. Lowrey.

1131
01:15:50,217 --> 01:15:51,593
Who am I speaking to?

1132
01:15:51,593 --> 01:15:54,429
I think you know who you're speaking to.

1133
01:15:55,097 --> 01:15:56,431
<i>I need your boy...</i>

1134
01:15:57,766 --> 01:16:01,061
<i>and whatever evidence
your beloved captain had squirreled away.</i>

1135
01:16:01,603 --> 01:16:04,690
And for that, you can have your wife.

1136
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:07,109
<i>I'll call you back with instructions.</i>

1137
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:10,112
Aw, shit.

1138
01:16:11,989 --> 01:16:13,448
Goddamn it.

1139
01:16:14,491 --> 01:16:15,492
I'll go.

1140
01:16:21,290 --> 01:16:22,833
Let my life be worth something.

1141
01:16:25,335 --> 01:16:26,461
Never.

1142
01:16:29,256 --> 01:16:30,340
Never.

1143
01:16:38,265 --> 01:16:39,433
Mike.

1144
01:16:40,934 --> 01:16:42,186
He knew.

1145
01:16:42,186 --> 01:16:43,645
What do you mean?

1146
01:16:44,855 --> 01:16:46,565
He knew we were comin' in.

1147
01:16:46,565 --> 01:16:48,942
He knew we had Captain Howard's files.

1148
01:16:49,443 --> 01:16:51,570
He knew we had ID'd him.

1149
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:53,071
How?

1150
01:16:53,822 --> 01:16:55,949
Only person you spoke to was Rita.

1151
01:16:57,117 --> 01:16:58,410
It's not Rita.

1152
01:17:01,205 --> 01:17:03,582
Damn, she got bad taste in men.

1153
01:17:04,124 --> 01:17:07,753
<i>Justice has been investigating
the corruption in the Miami Police Department...</i>

1154
01:17:07,753 --> 01:17:10,422
<i>...with reports suggesting
the late Captain Conrad Howard...</i>

1155
01:17:10,422 --> 01:17:11,632
Hello?

1156
01:17:11,632 --> 01:17:14,051
<i>...was directing these elements
in coordination with the cartels.</i>

1157
01:17:14,051 --> 01:17:16,929
<i>Allegations against Howard,
which allude to include Lowrey and Burnett,</i>

1158
01:17:17,638 --> 01:17:22,184
<i>and the operation range from helping cartels
move the product into the state of Florida</i>

1159
01:17:22,184 --> 01:17:25,020
<i>as well as giving up key witnesses,
destruction of evidence,</i>

1160
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:26,855
<i>and even the murder of fellow officers.</i>

1161
01:17:26,855 --> 01:17:29,316
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

1162
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:33,904
There's been a breakthrough in the case.
I need to get down to the station.

1163
01:17:35,948 --> 01:17:37,115
I'm gonna head down there.

1164
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:41,745
I'm coming with you.

1165
01:17:55,175 --> 01:17:56,760
Who are you texting?

1166
01:17:57,678 --> 01:18:01,807
Just... Just gotta get in touch with the office.

1167
01:18:02,891 --> 01:18:04,184
JTF.

1168
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:06,144
Gotta let everybody know.

1169
01:18:14,027 --> 01:18:15,654
Hey. Honey. Come on.

1170
01:18:15,654 --> 01:18:18,073
Honey, what are you doing? Stop that.

1171
01:18:18,073 --> 01:18:19,867
What are you doing? Stop it.

1172
01:18:19,867 --> 01:18:21,660
- Let go of me.
- What are you doing?

1173
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:23,287
Give it back to me. Give it back!

1174
01:18:55,527 --> 01:18:56,653
Fuck!

1175
01:18:57,446 --> 01:18:58,906
Hey, hey, come on.

1176
01:19:01,491 --> 01:19:02,576
You okay?

1177
01:19:02,576 --> 01:19:03,994
Look at the phone.

1178
01:19:14,755 --> 01:19:16,632
You know you done fucked up, right?

1179
01:19:22,137 --> 01:19:23,388
You all right?

1180
01:19:27,643 --> 01:19:28,894
I'm sorry.

1181
01:19:30,395 --> 01:19:32,397
Ain't got nothing to be sorry for.

1182
01:19:55,587 --> 01:19:57,214
We'll find her, boss.

1183
01:20:01,176 --> 01:20:05,430
I don't trust anybody
that's not standing right here, right now.

1184
01:20:06,557 --> 01:20:08,809
Every extra person that we involve

1185
01:20:08,809 --> 01:20:11,895
increases the likelihood
that they know we're coming,

1186
01:20:12,563 --> 01:20:16,567
which increases the likelihood
that Christine and Callie

1187
01:20:16,567 --> 01:20:18,402
don't make it out of there.

1188
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:23,740
That means no SWAT,
no marshals, no backup.

1189
01:20:25,284 --> 01:20:26,702
It's just us.

1190
01:20:32,165 --> 01:20:34,001
I never meant for it to go this way.

1191
01:20:34,793 --> 01:20:36,461
How did you mean it to go?

1192
01:20:37,087 --> 01:20:40,966
After 9/11, nobody cared
about drugs coming into this country.

1193
01:20:40,966 --> 01:20:44,178
So to secure the borders
we started to work with the cartels.

1194
01:20:44,178 --> 01:20:48,015
And they kept us informed about
any terrorist activity coming our way.

1195
01:20:48,015 --> 01:20:51,518
And it worked.
We haven't had an attack since.

1196
01:20:52,269 --> 01:20:53,812
We were protecting this country.

1197
01:20:53,812 --> 01:20:58,358
You were killing cops
and getting rich putting drugs into this country.

1198
01:20:58,358 --> 01:21:00,736
- Rita.
- That's why you killed Howard.

1199
01:21:00,736 --> 01:21:03,113
He was onto you.
You wanted to cover your tracks.

1200
01:21:03,113 --> 01:21:05,407
No. That was McGrath.

1201
01:21:05,949 --> 01:21:07,618
He's out of control.

1202
01:21:07,618 --> 01:21:10,120
Rita. Just take a second.

1203
01:21:10,704 --> 01:21:13,207
I never meant
for any of this to go this way.

1204
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:26,553
I guess I just need to know
if it was ever real.

1205
01:21:27,346 --> 01:21:29,014
It was always real.

1206
01:21:29,515 --> 01:21:32,476
I panicked. I lost control.

1207
01:21:33,143 --> 01:21:34,770
Did you love me?

1208
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:36,063
Yes.

1209
01:21:36,730 --> 01:21:38,148
I swear.

1210
01:21:38,857 --> 01:21:40,442
Well, that means...

1211
01:21:40,442 --> 01:21:41,610
We good. We got it.

1212
01:21:41,610 --> 01:21:43,654
99% voice match.

1213
01:21:45,072 --> 01:21:49,368
...absolutely nothing to me,
you piece of shit.

1214
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:57,751
<i>Hey. It's me.</i>

1215
01:21:58,377 --> 01:22:00,337
What the hell's going on?

1216
01:22:00,337 --> 01:22:02,089
<i>You screwed up is what's going on.</i>

1217
01:22:02,214 --> 01:22:06,051
We've been compromised.
I'll explain when I get there.

1218
01:22:06,051 --> 01:22:09,429
<i>We're moving the hostages.
Cuba. Long-term hold...</i>

1219
01:22:10,097 --> 01:22:14,309
to keep Lowrey, Burnett and Aretas quiet
while we sort this out.

1220
01:22:14,434 --> 01:22:17,604
I'm bringing a seaplane.
I'll be there at first light.

1221
01:22:22,317 --> 01:22:24,444
All right, pack this place up.

1222
01:22:24,444 --> 01:22:27,114
All equipment and personnel
prepare to move.

1223
01:22:27,614 --> 01:22:29,741
We're moving the hostages
out of the country.

1224
01:22:44,214 --> 01:22:45,716
What happened to your hand?

1225
01:22:54,349 --> 01:22:56,810
They call that a Colombian manicure.

1226
01:23:02,941 --> 01:23:04,526
What's so great about it

1227
01:23:05,027 --> 01:23:07,070
is it's the maximum amount of pain,

1228
01:23:07,070 --> 01:23:08,197
but you don't die.

1229
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:16,663
So now you've decided
to be the one holding the pliers.

1230
01:23:18,373 --> 01:23:19,958
Everybody breaks.

1231
01:23:21,001 --> 01:23:22,294
Everyone.

1232
01:23:22,878 --> 01:23:24,171
Your husband...

1233
01:23:24,796 --> 01:23:27,090
is gonna kneel down in front of me...

1234
01:23:27,591 --> 01:23:29,510
and beg for your lives.

1235
01:23:30,677 --> 01:23:33,180
And then you're gonna watch me kill him.

1236
01:23:36,099 --> 01:23:38,310
You don't know my husband.

1237
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:41,313
Well, not officially, but...

1238
01:23:41,897 --> 01:23:43,982
I look forward to seeing him again.

1239
01:23:56,662 --> 01:23:59,581
<i>Bad boys
Bad boys</i>

1240
01:24:05,337 --> 01:24:06,755
Come on, Mike.

1241
01:24:08,006 --> 01:24:11,134
<i>Bad boys
Bad boys</i>

1242
01:24:16,932 --> 01:24:18,517
<i>Whatchu you gonna do</i>

1243
01:24:19,184 --> 01:24:20,185
Yeah.

1244
01:24:20,185 --> 01:24:23,272
<i>What you gonna do
When they come for you</i>

1245
01:24:27,109 --> 01:24:29,278
That's enough, dawg. That's enough.

1246
01:24:29,278 --> 01:24:31,989
Okay, well,
we'll circle back on that one.

1247
01:24:42,541 --> 01:24:45,544
All right. The plane is ready.
We roll in 20.

1248
01:24:45,544 --> 01:24:48,338
<i>It's an abandoned amusement park.
There should be no civilians.</i>

1249
01:24:48,338 --> 01:24:51,800
Plane is gonna land from the south.
On the one side.

1250
01:24:52,551 --> 01:24:55,053
<i>Marcus and I will be on the plane.</i>

1251
01:24:55,053 --> 01:24:58,765
<i>Armando's gonna make
his way in the water. The two side.</i>

1252
01:24:58,765 --> 01:25:03,228
Kelly, Rita.
This road is one way in, one way out.

1253
01:25:03,228 --> 01:25:05,063
<i>You're holding that road.</i>

1254
01:25:07,107 --> 01:25:08,817
<i>Dorn, you're gonna control the air.</i>

1255
01:25:08,817 --> 01:25:12,571
<i>Drones in the air,
jamming is active, comms are secure.</i>

1256
01:25:12,946 --> 01:25:15,741
As far as they know,
Lockwood is on his way with the plane

1257
01:25:15,741 --> 01:25:18,243
<i>to move the hostages to Cuba.</i>

1258
01:25:19,119 --> 01:25:22,497
The second they get close to the plane
with the hostages, it's quick kills.

1259
01:25:22,497 --> 01:25:24,291
Neutralize all threats.

1260
01:25:24,291 --> 01:25:26,835
These motherfuckers
killed a lot of good cops.

1261
01:25:26,835 --> 01:25:29,004
<i>They have my wife, they have Callie.</i>

1262
01:25:29,004 --> 01:25:30,964
They attacked our families.

1263
01:25:31,757 --> 01:25:33,091
We not losing today.

1264
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:37,262
Hey.

1265
01:25:38,472 --> 01:25:41,016
We get on the ground, you even flinch,

1266
01:25:41,016 --> 01:25:43,185
you'll be dead in .24 seconds.

1267
01:25:43,185 --> 01:25:44,603
I concur.

1268
01:25:46,146 --> 01:25:48,565
<i>I got one lookout on the platform outside.</i>

1269
01:25:48,565 --> 01:25:51,360
I got one sniper on the roof of building two.

1270
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:53,028
Tee those up.

1271
01:25:55,822 --> 01:25:57,282
Everybody keep moving.

1272
01:25:57,282 --> 01:25:59,368
- What are those?
- Gators.

1273
01:25:59,368 --> 01:26:02,079
I thought it was an <i>abandoned</i> gator park.

1274
01:26:02,079 --> 01:26:03,455
Abandoned by humans.

1275
01:26:04,206 --> 01:26:05,707
It's actually an old amusement park.

1276
01:26:05,707 --> 01:26:09,127
It sat on 10 acres,
abandoned in 2017 after Hurricane Irma.

1277
01:26:09,670 --> 01:26:14,132
<i>Their main attraction
was an albino alligator named Duke...</i>

1278
01:26:14,132 --> 01:26:17,636
...who was 16 feet long, 900 pounds.

1279
01:26:17,636 --> 01:26:20,222
"And legend has it he's still there."

1280
01:26:20,806 --> 01:26:21,890
Fuck that.

1281
01:26:36,864 --> 01:26:38,240
Armando's at his QTH.

1282
01:27:03,599 --> 01:27:05,434
Hostages are coming out now.

1283
01:27:05,434 --> 01:27:06,894
McGrath plus three.

1284
01:27:07,436 --> 01:27:08,854
Everybody stay calm.

1285
01:27:19,615 --> 01:27:20,824
Mike.

1286
01:27:23,285 --> 01:27:25,037
Mike, do you have the shot?

1287
01:27:25,037 --> 01:27:28,457
Negative. I do not have a shot.
I do not have a shot.

1288
01:27:32,544 --> 01:27:35,422
- Mike, he's right there.
- I don't have it. I don't have it.

1289
01:27:42,387 --> 01:27:44,681
They stopped. Why'd they stop?

1290
01:27:58,320 --> 01:27:59,404
Shit.

1291
01:28:02,533 --> 01:28:03,909
Let's go.

1292
01:28:13,961 --> 01:28:15,712
Armando, they're closing in on you.

1293
01:28:15,712 --> 01:28:17,548
- Do they see him?
- I don't know.

1294
01:28:17,548 --> 01:28:20,092
Mike, now. Your chance is now.

1295
01:28:20,092 --> 01:28:22,386
<i>They can see him.
They know we're here.</i>

1296
01:28:25,055 --> 01:28:27,099
I don't have it.
Negative. Negative. Negative.

1297
01:28:27,099 --> 01:28:29,142
You gotta take the fuckin' shot.

1298
01:28:49,204 --> 01:28:50,330
Armando's burnt.

1299
01:28:51,540 --> 01:28:54,126
- Shit.
- Full green. Engage.

1300
01:28:54,126 --> 01:28:56,545
Kelly, get us there. Go, go, go!

1301
01:29:19,484 --> 01:29:21,486
Contact, west dock side.

1302
01:29:30,204 --> 01:29:31,872
Dorn! Take out that sniper!

1303
01:29:32,372 --> 01:29:33,624
Sending the drone.

1304
01:29:42,799 --> 01:29:43,884
Got him.

1305
01:30:06,323 --> 01:30:08,408
Not now, Mike!

1306
01:30:08,408 --> 01:30:10,118
Not now!

1307
01:30:31,306 --> 01:30:32,724
It's okay.

1308
01:30:33,517 --> 01:30:34,935
Not your fault.

1309
01:30:42,526 --> 01:30:45,195
Cut that bitch-ass shit out, Mike.

1310
01:30:45,195 --> 01:30:46,780
I need Nasty Mike.

1311
01:30:46,780 --> 01:30:48,031
Nasty Mike!

1312
01:30:48,031 --> 01:30:50,951
Bad shit happens,
but that doesn't mean you're bad.

1313
01:30:50,951 --> 01:30:54,121
Do that donkey shit, a'ight?
That's what I'm talking about.

1314
01:30:54,121 --> 01:30:56,540
That shit right there.
That's that shit right there.

1315
01:30:57,124 --> 01:31:01,003
Bad boy. Bad boy.
Bad Boy Mike. All right?

1316
01:31:01,003 --> 01:31:03,547
<i>You're the big bad wolf
in the neighborhood</i>

1317
01:31:03,547 --> 01:31:06,008
<i>Not bad meaning bad
but bad meaning good</i>

1318
01:31:36,288 --> 01:31:38,290
<i>- Dorn, take out the vehicles on the four side.</i>
- Copy.

1319
01:31:46,215 --> 01:31:47,591
Go, go! Move it!

1320
01:31:48,091 --> 01:31:51,094
Sir! We're taking heavies.
We lost the trucks and three guys outside.

1321
01:31:51,220 --> 01:31:52,888
Goddamn it!

1322
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:55,599
Set firing positions, both sides.
Let 'em in.

1323
01:31:55,599 --> 01:31:56,683
Go.

1324
01:31:57,559 --> 01:32:01,438
<i>Marshal Howard, heat signature
at the site of the AMMO van is showing explosions.</i>

1325
01:32:01,438 --> 01:32:02,856
<i>ETA 15 minutes.</i>

1326
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:08,779
Dorn, we need cover
and we need eyes inside. Go, now.

1327
01:32:09,905 --> 01:32:11,365
Here comes the smoke.

1328
01:32:13,325 --> 01:32:14,993
<i>I got your six.</i>

1329
01:32:32,386 --> 01:32:34,179
Shoot those motherfuckers!

1330
01:32:34,763 --> 01:32:37,349
- Get those drones down now!
- Go!

1331
01:32:37,349 --> 01:32:38,559
Move, move, move!

1332
01:32:38,559 --> 01:32:39,852
Eyes up!

1333
01:32:45,315 --> 01:32:46,859
Oh, shit!

1334
01:32:46,859 --> 01:32:50,070
It's like redneck Jurassic Park in here.

1335
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:06,962
Let's get out of here, now.

1336
01:33:06,962 --> 01:33:08,130
Kelly, go.

1337
01:33:08,130 --> 01:33:11,717
Dorn, back up Kelly inside.
I'm going after Lockwood.

1338
01:33:12,342 --> 01:33:13,552
Babe, I'm comin'.

1339
01:33:20,350 --> 01:33:21,852
Armando, go for Callie!

1340
01:33:24,396 --> 01:33:25,480
Let go!

1341
01:33:26,231 --> 01:33:27,232
Mike!

1342
01:33:28,025 --> 01:33:29,026
Marcus!

1343
01:33:47,544 --> 01:33:48,670
Go!

1344
01:33:53,759 --> 01:33:54,968
I'm out!

1345
01:34:29,586 --> 01:34:31,505
Nice to meet you, Mr. Lowrey.

1346
01:34:33,215 --> 01:34:34,216
Grenade!

1347
01:34:40,097 --> 01:34:41,306
Oh sh--!

1348
01:34:54,862 --> 01:34:56,280
Holy shit!

1349
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:57,447
Hang on!

1350
01:35:29,479 --> 01:35:30,647
Stop!

1351
01:35:31,398 --> 01:35:32,566
Christine!

1352
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:36,069
Christine!

1353
01:35:36,570 --> 01:35:38,030
Shit.

1354
01:35:40,574 --> 01:35:42,117
Oh sh--!

1355
01:35:42,117 --> 01:35:44,161
- Mike, I got this!
- No. No, no!

1356
01:35:44,161 --> 01:35:46,205
Here I come, baby! Here I come!

1357
01:35:46,205 --> 01:35:47,581
No! No! No!

1358
01:36:02,221 --> 01:36:03,514
Marcus!

1359
01:36:03,514 --> 01:36:05,015
- What?
- Behind you.

1360
01:36:07,142 --> 01:36:08,435
Oh, shit.

1361
01:36:17,819 --> 01:36:19,530
I got this, Mike.

1362
01:36:20,322 --> 01:36:22,282
It's just Dukey, baby.

1363
01:36:25,077 --> 01:36:27,538
Marcus, my gun. I dropped my gun
in the water. It's by your foot.

1364
01:36:27,538 --> 01:36:28,872
I don't need no gun, Mike.

1365
01:36:31,834 --> 01:36:33,669
Begone, gator.

1366
01:36:35,045 --> 01:36:37,005
This is not your place, Duke.

1367
01:36:37,756 --> 01:36:39,466
I rebuke you!

1368
01:36:43,136 --> 01:36:44,429
See, Mike?

1369
01:36:44,972 --> 01:36:47,474
That's how you command the universe.

1370
01:36:59,862 --> 01:37:02,030
- Where's the gun? Where's the gun?
- Oh, shit!

1371
01:37:08,036 --> 01:37:09,121
{\an8}Go, go.

1372
01:37:09,913 --> 01:37:13,292
That motherfucker racist, Mike.
That motherfucker racist!

1373
01:37:20,007 --> 01:37:21,508
Mike sent me.

1374
01:37:21,508 --> 01:37:22,718
I need you to trust me.

1375
01:37:47,951 --> 01:37:48,994
Run.

1376
01:37:48,994 --> 01:37:50,204
Run!

1377
01:38:34,456 --> 01:38:36,542
Come on. Come on. Get up.

1378
01:38:51,181 --> 01:38:52,391
Stop!

1379
01:38:56,603 --> 01:38:58,146
Go! I'll slow you down.

1380
01:39:01,984 --> 01:39:03,485
Eyes on location.

1381
01:39:25,340 --> 01:39:26,675
Oh, shit.

1382
01:39:28,969 --> 01:39:30,262
You alive?

1383
01:39:37,769 --> 01:39:38,770
Shit.

1384
01:39:39,271 --> 01:39:40,480
Okay. Hey.

1385
01:39:43,775 --> 01:39:46,653
Rita, stop this.
You don't want to shoot me.

1386
01:39:46,653 --> 01:39:47,738
You're right.

1387
01:40:09,176 --> 01:40:12,012
Come here. Okay. Okay. It's okay.

1388
01:40:12,930 --> 01:40:14,431
I fuckin' hate politicians.

1389
01:40:22,064 --> 01:40:23,732
- Let's move!
- Go, go!

1390
01:40:27,194 --> 01:40:29,238
Fan out. Take the team upstairs.

1391
01:40:32,115 --> 01:40:33,534
No targets.

1392
01:40:38,747 --> 01:40:40,249
Go topside!

1393
01:40:52,553 --> 01:40:54,555
Okay. Okay, here.

1394
01:40:54,555 --> 01:40:56,139
- Put me down. It's okay.
- Okay.

1395
01:40:56,265 --> 01:40:58,433
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1396
01:40:59,726 --> 01:41:00,811
Hey.

1397
01:41:04,064 --> 01:41:05,315
Thank you.

1398
01:41:26,753 --> 01:41:28,672
I've been here before.

1399
01:41:31,258 --> 01:41:32,843
Oh, shit.

1400
01:41:56,241 --> 01:41:57,659
How did you let him catch you?

1401
01:41:57,659 --> 01:41:59,786
He's sneaky as hell, Mike.

1402
01:41:59,786 --> 01:42:01,747
Your wife and I were having a debate.

1403
01:42:01,747 --> 01:42:04,750
She seems to have
an inflated impression of you.

1404
01:42:04,750 --> 01:42:06,668
- Mike.
- Hey, bae.

1405
01:42:07,461 --> 01:42:09,713
Nevertheless, this is the end of the road.

1406
01:42:10,380 --> 01:42:12,007
One of them is about to die.

1407
01:42:12,758 --> 01:42:14,176
You choose.

1408
01:42:18,347 --> 01:42:20,307
What you don't know, Mr. McGrath...

1409
01:42:21,183 --> 01:42:23,143
is one of 'em can't die.

1410
01:42:25,187 --> 01:42:26,813
Who you talking 'bout?

1411
01:42:26,813 --> 01:42:29,733
A wise man told me
I was gonna have to make a hard choice.

1412
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:34,238
You need to check with that motherfucker
before you out here choosing shit.

1413
01:42:34,238 --> 01:42:36,448
You have five seconds, Mr. Lowrey.

1414
01:42:36,448 --> 01:42:38,116
We gonna need some more time, sir.

1415
01:42:38,116 --> 01:42:40,536
Four... three...

1416
01:42:40,536 --> 01:42:42,829
Mike. Don't you do no dumb shit.

1417
01:42:42,955 --> 01:42:43,997
...two...

1418
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:03,141
- Mike. Mike.
- Hey. Hey. I'm here.

1419
01:43:05,102 --> 01:43:06,854
Motherfucker done shot me.

1420
01:43:06,854 --> 01:43:08,272
Aw, damn.

1421
01:43:08,272 --> 01:43:11,775
- Here. Let me check it. Let me see.
- No, Mike. Your donkey ass shot me again.

1422
01:43:11,775 --> 01:43:15,445
- Let me look at it.
- Don't touch me with your donkey hooves, Mike.

1423
01:43:15,445 --> 01:43:16,738
Damn, man.

1424
01:43:16,738 --> 01:43:18,740
Listen. I had to fucking take the shot.

1425
01:43:18,740 --> 01:43:19,867
No, Mike. No.

1426
01:43:19,867 --> 01:43:21,910
Marcus. Let me take a look.

1427
01:43:21,910 --> 01:43:23,453
You see that shit, Christine?

1428
01:43:23,453 --> 01:43:26,915
- I shot you in your vest. Stop bitchin'.
- It don't matter. Okay?

1429
01:43:26,915 --> 01:43:29,585
You see what you done
devoted your life to, Christine?

1430
01:43:29,585 --> 01:43:31,587
<i>I've got eyes on Aretas. Moving in.</i>

1431
01:43:31,587 --> 01:43:33,213
Shit. That's Judy.

1432
01:43:34,047 --> 01:43:35,674
Armando, do you copy?

1433
01:43:35,674 --> 01:43:36,925
<i>Armando, do you copy?</i>

1434
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:41,096
Oh, shit.

1435
01:43:41,096 --> 01:43:43,182
Mom. Mom, don't.

1436
01:43:43,182 --> 01:43:45,017
Get away from her.

1437
01:43:45,017 --> 01:43:46,602
- Mom.
- Now!

1438
01:43:47,436 --> 01:43:49,021
Mom, listen to me, you don't understand.

1439
01:43:49,021 --> 01:43:50,981
Callie, I need you to listen to me.

1440
01:43:50,981 --> 01:43:54,359
I want you to step slowly to your right
and walk towards me.

1441
01:43:54,359 --> 01:43:56,069
Mom. Mom, I'm fine, okay?

1442
01:43:56,528 --> 01:44:00,157
Callie, I need you to move out of the way.

1443
01:44:00,866 --> 01:44:01,867
Mom.

1444
01:44:01,867 --> 01:44:05,412
Mom, don't shoot, don't shoot!
Mom, he saved me. Stop!

1445
01:44:05,412 --> 01:44:06,663
Judy! Judy!

1446
01:44:06,663 --> 01:44:09,875
Back off, Mike! Put the gun down.

1447
01:44:11,543 --> 01:44:13,212
He saved my life.

1448
01:44:18,050 --> 01:44:19,676
Please, Mom.

1449
01:44:38,445 --> 01:44:40,447
Mom. Mom.

1450
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:43,158
Are you hit? Are you hit?

1451
01:44:43,158 --> 01:44:44,368
I'm good.

1452
01:44:45,244 --> 01:44:46,578
You good?

1453
01:44:51,750 --> 01:44:53,877
You did good. You did good.

1454
01:44:53,877 --> 01:44:55,671
<i>Howard. Where are you?</i>

1455
01:44:59,591 --> 01:45:01,134
<i>Howard. Do you copy?</i>

1456
01:45:04,096 --> 01:45:06,056
<i>Howard, what's your location?</i>

1457
01:45:10,602 --> 01:45:11,687
Go.

1458
01:45:13,605 --> 01:45:15,023
Before I change my mind.

1459
01:45:16,817 --> 01:45:18,610
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

1460
01:45:25,701 --> 01:45:28,287
Hey. You good? You good?

1461
01:45:28,287 --> 01:45:29,621
Hey.

1462
01:45:29,621 --> 01:45:30,747
Take this.

1463
01:45:31,290 --> 01:45:33,125
Head south. Don't look back.

1464
01:45:33,125 --> 01:45:34,209
Hey.

1465
01:45:34,209 --> 01:45:35,669
I got it.

1466
01:45:35,669 --> 01:45:36,879
Be good.

1467
01:45:37,588 --> 01:45:39,214
It's not up to you, detective.

1468
01:46:23,425 --> 01:46:25,302
Come on, come on.
We got injured cops here.

1469
01:46:25,302 --> 01:46:27,513
I need you to bring the writ to me now.

1470
01:46:28,388 --> 01:46:29,515
I know, I know, I know.

1471
01:46:29,515 --> 01:46:31,600
- How is he?
- You know, he'll pull through.

1472
01:46:38,690 --> 01:46:40,317
Don't kiss him, Christine.

1473
01:46:41,109 --> 01:46:44,738
<i>Mike, in our next life,
you coming back as a pair of my shoes.</i>

1474
01:46:44,738 --> 01:46:46,532
<i>And I ain't gonna wear no socks.</i>

1475
01:46:46,532 --> 01:46:48,617
<i>And I'mma step in all kind of shit.</i>

1476
01:46:49,117 --> 01:46:53,622
<i>Miami DA and mayoral candidate Adam Lockwood
and former Army Ranger James McGrath</i>

1477
01:46:53,622 --> 01:46:55,457
<i>were killed this morning
in a firefight.</i>

1478
01:46:55,457 --> 01:46:57,668
<i>It is believed that Lockwood and McGrath
were the key links</i>

1479
01:46:57,668 --> 01:46:59,628
<i>between Miami law enforcement
and cartels.</i>

1480
01:46:59,628 --> 01:47:02,047
<i>The late Captain Howard
has been fully exonerated.</i>

1481
01:47:02,047 --> 01:47:06,677
<i>Co-conspirators are currently being
rounded up by the FBI and the Miami PD.</i>

1482
01:47:06,677 --> 01:47:10,347
<i>The search for convicted killer
Armando Aretas continues.</i>

1483
01:47:10,347 --> 01:47:12,140
<i>The fugitive remains at large.</i>

1484
01:47:21,567 --> 01:47:23,151
Hey, hey, hey. My people.

1485
01:47:23,151 --> 01:47:26,071
- Where's Theresa?
- She's with Little Marcus by the swings.

1486
01:47:26,071 --> 01:47:27,823
Hey. I'm about you hook you all up.

1487
01:47:27,823 --> 01:47:29,157
- I'm about you hook you up.
- Please. We're starving.

1488
01:47:29,157 --> 01:47:30,534
Watch this.

1489
01:47:31,702 --> 01:47:32,828
Partner.

1490
01:47:34,288 --> 01:47:35,706
What's all this?

1491
01:47:37,416 --> 01:47:38,542
Why you got on an apron?

1492
01:47:38,542 --> 01:47:40,544
Work on my grill skills.

1493
01:47:40,544 --> 01:47:42,880
No, Mike, you gotta earn the grill.

1494
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:47,843
This takes seasonings and temperatures.
You can't just be cooking on my grill.

1495
01:47:47,843 --> 01:47:50,929
Your grill? Joker, this is a public park.

1496
01:47:50,929 --> 01:47:53,015
You don't own every grill you see.

1497
01:47:53,015 --> 01:47:57,603
You know what, Mike? Why don't you
go make some potato salad and set the table.

1498
01:47:57,603 --> 01:47:59,271
Oh, you talking dirty.

1499
01:47:59,271 --> 01:48:01,648
Now, look. I don't...
I don't know what you got going on

1500
01:48:01,648 --> 01:48:05,360
with your barbeque dictatorship
in your mind, but I ain't the one.

1501
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:07,654
I'm cooking on this grill
whether you like it or not.

1502
01:48:07,654 --> 01:48:09,573
- Hey, Mike--
- Excuse me, sirs.

1503
01:48:11,241 --> 01:48:13,035
What are you...
What you doin', Reggie?

1504
01:48:13,160 --> 01:48:14,912
Request permission to cook my chicken.

1505
01:48:19,833 --> 01:48:21,585
Permission denied, Reggie.
Go ahead somewhere, man.

1506
01:48:21,585 --> 01:48:23,712
Take your smock off
and go play with the kids.

1507
01:48:23,712 --> 01:48:27,257
Listen, this is the man area
of the barbeque.

1508
01:48:27,257 --> 01:48:32,554
Look, you know what? All due respect,
we appreciate that you did save people that we love.

1509
01:48:32,554 --> 01:48:34,097
- We appreciate that, right?
- Yeah, we appreciate that.

1510
01:48:34,097 --> 01:48:36,558
- We appreciate that from here, Reggie.
- Yeah.

1511
01:48:36,558 --> 01:48:39,394
- Now, back the fuck up.
- Yeah.

1512
01:48:39,394 --> 01:48:41,480
All right, look.
I'm willing to compromise with you.

1513
01:48:41,480 --> 01:48:44,691
You can work that half of the grill.
It's small. And I'll work this half.

1514
01:48:44,691 --> 01:48:46,568
Is he still standing there?

1515
01:48:48,904 --> 01:48:50,072
Yes, he is.

1516
01:48:50,072 --> 01:48:51,615
Huh, that's weird.

1517
01:48:51,615 --> 01:48:52,991
Yeah.

1518
01:48:52,991 --> 01:48:55,035
He think he hard now.

1519
01:48:56,578 --> 01:49:01,041
You need to let that motherfucker know
he ain't cooking no chicken out here today.

1520
01:49:01,041 --> 01:49:05,128
Mike. He killed 15 people at the house.

1521
01:49:05,712 --> 01:49:07,589
So, you not gonna handle this shit.

1522
01:49:07,589 --> 01:49:10,926
Yeah, I'm gonna let
that motherfucker cook the chicken.

1523
01:49:14,888 --> 01:49:18,350
Yeah, there's something weird in his eyes.
So I'mma make the potato salad.

1524
01:49:18,350 --> 01:49:19,977
- I'mma set the table.
- Yeah.

1525
01:49:19,977 --> 01:49:21,562
Permission granted, Reggie.
There you go.

1526
01:55:28,345 --> 01:55:30,764
Come on. Bring your ass on.

1527
01:55:30,764 --> 01:55:32,808
It's too hot out here for this shit.

1528
01:55:32,933 --> 01:55:36,603
Wish I had a horse.
At least I could ride that motherfucker.

1529
01:55:36,603 --> 01:55:40,774
All this free air out here,
and I still smell your stinkin' ass.

1530
01:55:43,819 --> 01:55:45,195
I curse you, donkey.

1531
01:55:45,195 --> 01:55:47,990
I curse you for all lifetimes.

1532
01:55:49,533 --> 01:55:50,742
You mother--

1533
01:55:50,742 --> 01:55:52,578
Fuck you, Marcus.
