1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000

3
00:01:02,313 --> 00:01:06,812
Day 34 of observing Eun-seo
via the smart home system,

4
00:01:06,813 --> 00:01:09,565
and behavior observation cams.

5
00:01:10,313 --> 00:01:12,436
The cause of her symptoms

6
00:01:12,437 --> 00:01:20,396
may have stemmed from
the panic disorder five years ago,

7
00:01:20,397 --> 00:01:25,565
after our mother's passing,
and the stress of moving

8
00:01:26,565 --> 00:01:31,064
along with the stress of
practicing all day

9
00:01:31,065 --> 00:01:33,065
for her audition by herself.

10
00:02:22,149 --> 00:02:24,897
A fallen angel who rules Hell

11
00:02:26,357 --> 00:02:29,229
A demon that
devours child sacrifices

12
00:02:30,437 --> 00:02:33,189
Chief lieutenant of Lucifer

13
00:02:34,649 --> 00:02:37,397
A fallen angel
who became Hell's guardian

14
00:02:38,605 --> 00:02:41,981
Leader of the worshipers
overseeing the entire ritual

15
00:02:43,357 --> 00:02:46,813
Followers of the Devil

16
00:02:50,021 --> 00:02:54,021
The act of freeing someone
from possession by an evil spirit

17
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:13,025
DEMON HUNTERS

18
00:03:17,065 --> 00:03:18,565
All done!

19
00:03:19,773 --> 00:03:20,772
Evening, Kim.

20
00:03:20,773 --> 00:03:22,104
- Det. Choi, welcome.
- Good evening.

21
00:03:22,105 --> 00:03:23,104
Hey, Sharon.

22
00:03:23,105 --> 00:03:23,772
Is Ba-woo in?

23
00:03:23,773 --> 00:03:25,312
Yes, he is.

24
00:03:25,313 --> 00:03:26,521
He's a client.

25
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:28,772
- Good evening.
- Hello.

26
00:03:28,773 --> 00:03:30,813
You may go inside.

27
00:03:32,565 --> 00:03:34,481
Boss, Det. Choi is here.

28
00:03:40,981 --> 00:03:44,272
A month ago, my daughter
became unreachable,

29
00:03:44,273 --> 00:03:46,021
I think she went missing.

30
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:48,693
She'd never just disappear.

31
00:03:48,694 --> 00:03:50,194
Something is definitely wrong here.

32
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,278
Three of my men were assaulted
while searching for her.

33
00:03:55,238 --> 00:03:57,322
Two are dead, and one's in ICU.

34
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,822
As usual, I need your help on this.

35
00:04:00,992 --> 00:04:06,071
If the detectives were harmed,
I realized it was more serious.

36
00:04:06,072 --> 00:04:08,864
So I asked him for a favor
and came to you for help.

37
00:04:09,364 --> 00:04:13,199
Don't worry too much,
we'll look into this case closely.

38
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,279
Kim, get something to drink.

39
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,616
Sure, one moment.

40
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:17,908
I'm okay...

41
00:04:20,116 --> 00:04:21,156
Pardon me...

42
00:04:22,532 --> 00:04:23,863
Sorry about that.

43
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:25,572
Do you have any leads?

44
00:04:26,082 --> 00:04:28,873
We secured a location
from a photo we obtained,

45
00:04:28,874 --> 00:04:32,165
but my team got attacked
and we couldn't rescue her.

46
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,206
Here, Sharon.

47
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,374
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

48
00:04:35,824 --> 00:04:36,908
Thanks.

49
00:04:42,062 --> 00:04:43,518
- Go inside.
- Okay.

50
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:46,665
Would you like some water?

51
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:54,333
Don't worry, we'll do our best.

52
00:04:56,789 --> 00:04:58,125
Detective...

53
00:04:58,957 --> 00:05:01,665
Can I trust them...

54
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,581
You can absolutely trust us.

55
00:05:04,457 --> 00:05:09,789
We may look shady,
but we're professionals.

56
00:05:11,165 --> 00:05:13,416
Please find her for me.

57
00:05:13,417 --> 00:05:15,248
- We'll do our best.
- Yes, sir.

58
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:16,581
Thank you.

59
00:05:21,373 --> 00:05:23,041
Here's the payment,
in cash as usual.

60
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,041
You didn't skimp some
like last time, right?

61
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:29,372
What do you take me for?
I'm a cop.

62
00:05:29,373 --> 00:05:31,665
How many clients
have I brought you so far?

63
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,457
For your kids.

64
00:05:36,373 --> 00:05:37,457
What do you take me for?

65
00:05:38,917 --> 00:05:39,624
Don't want it?

66
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:40,957
This is serious.

67
00:05:41,917 --> 00:05:43,624
A lot of people have been killed.

68
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:44,416
I hear you.

69
00:05:44,417 --> 00:05:46,457
All right, guys.

70
00:05:48,165 --> 00:05:49,417
Let's go to work.

71
00:06:15,873 --> 00:06:19,288
Murders and assaults are
taking place

72
00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:23,916
by unknown assailants
across the country,

73
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,748
leaving the public in fear.

74
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:26,416
Bold Murder in the City Center
– Police Helpless

75
00:06:26,417 --> 00:06:30,040
Bold Murder in the City Center
– Police Helpless
The police believe that
a mysterious group,

76
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,500
along with organized criminals,
are involved.

77
00:06:32,501 --> 00:06:35,164
A special task force has been formed,

78
00:06:35,165 --> 00:06:39,501
but the criminals have brutally
murdered officers at the scene...

79
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:45,956
In my 30 years as an officer,

80
00:06:45,957 --> 00:06:48,625
I've never seen
such vicious incidents, Father.

81
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:53,080
They talk about demons and devils,

82
00:06:53,081 --> 00:06:55,872
and as we witness
unbelievable events,

83
00:06:55,873 --> 00:07:00,541
we can't handle this with
the police force alone, Father.

84
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:04,540
They blindly devote themselves
to a devil worshipper,

85
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:08,289
and obtained superhuman strength
by drawing on the Devil's power.

86
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:12,001
Ordinary people can't stand up to them.

87
00:07:14,894 --> 00:07:16,730
That's why we need him.

88
00:09:25,401 --> 00:09:26,485
Kill them!

89
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:34,361
You vile demon.

90
00:10:35,653 --> 00:10:37,945
I command you.

91
00:10:38,653 --> 00:10:40,321
Return to hell!

92
00:10:41,277 --> 00:10:43,653
You are Bael, the Commander of Hell's Army.

93
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:45,693
Return to hell at once!

94
00:10:46,321 --> 00:10:47,569
Return!

95
00:10:50,237 --> 00:10:53,985
I command you!

96
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,193
Return to hell!

97
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,442
Return to hell immediately!

98
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:01,743
I command you.

99
00:11:15,203 --> 00:11:17,371
Return to hell.

100
00:11:18,743 --> 00:11:20,579
Return to hell immediately!

101
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,203
Let's see.

102
00:11:45,951 --> 00:11:46,995
Okay.

103
00:11:49,411 --> 00:11:50,950
Everything all right?

104
00:11:50,951 --> 00:11:52,159
I'm fine.

105
00:11:52,323 --> 00:11:53,951
No, not you, her.

106
00:11:55,951 --> 00:11:58,823
The evil spirit hadn't fully
possessed her, she'll be okay.

107
00:11:59,035 --> 00:12:00,075
That's good.

108
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:03,074
Um, boss...

109
00:12:03,075 --> 00:12:05,990
Things got pretty hairy earlier,
I missed some shots in the end.

110
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:07,114
What should I do?

111
00:12:07,115 --> 00:12:09,575
Have another take?
Should I wake them all up?

112
00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:12,534
No, we can't do that
but we need a proper ending.

113
00:12:12,535 --> 00:12:15,323
You should've shot properly!

114
00:12:16,407 --> 00:12:17,822
Yeah...

115
00:12:17,823 --> 00:12:19,490
Is Det. Choi on the way?

116
00:12:19,491 --> 00:12:20,823
Yes, he's heading over.

117
00:12:42,243 --> 00:12:45,406
I got a lot better thanks to you.

118
00:12:45,407 --> 00:12:49,074
I can breathe better,
thank you so much.

119
00:12:49,075 --> 00:12:50,534
I'm glad to hear it.

120
00:12:50,535 --> 00:12:52,822
You should still take your meds,

121
00:12:52,823 --> 00:12:55,699
and I'll drop the dosage
as I monitor the progress.

122
00:12:56,711 --> 00:12:58,170
Check up on her every 2 hours.

123
00:12:58,171 --> 00:12:59,171
Yes, doctor.

124
00:14:16,003 --> 00:14:19,795
Suspected of Schizophrenia Day 142 /
Exorcism Treatment Day 7

125
00:14:31,043 --> 00:14:33,335
The Man Who Punched Out
Four Gangs and Illegal Fight Clubs

126
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,459
Are They Devils? Or Messiahs?

127
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:42,003
Catalina, it's fine.

128
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:45,872
I'm making money to build
a Catholic orphanage.

129
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,916
No need to thank me.

130
00:14:49,624 --> 00:14:52,708
Yeah, Catalina, okay.

131
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,248
Boss, I found out who
those guys served.

132
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,707
Who?

133
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:58,331
Beelzebul.

134
00:14:58,332 --> 00:14:58,871
Beelzebul.
Chief lieutenant of Lucifer

135
00:14:58,872 --> 00:15:00,163
Chief lieutenant of Lucifer

136
00:15:00,164 --> 00:15:01,163
Chief lieutenant of Lucifer
Who's their leader?

137
00:15:01,164 --> 00:15:01,208
Who's their leader?

138
00:15:01,788 --> 00:15:03,787
I haven't found their archbishop yet,

139
00:15:03,788 --> 00:15:06,456
but I got informants all over the place.

140
00:15:06,577 --> 00:15:10,492
Ton of high-ranking demons
like Beelzebul are popping up,

141
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:13,284
a massive crisis may be on the horizon.

142
00:15:13,285 --> 00:15:16,992
I've seen them countless times,
but they still scare me.

143
00:15:16,993 --> 00:15:18,868
We're scared too.

144
00:15:18,869 --> 00:15:21,328
They're powered by demon's energy,

145
00:15:21,329 --> 00:15:23,701
so always keep your guard up.

146
00:15:24,745 --> 00:15:26,953
You still have a bright future.

147
00:15:29,621 --> 00:15:30,453
And me?

148
00:15:37,285 --> 00:15:38,369
Me?!

149
00:15:41,245 --> 00:15:43,661
Is my future bleak?

150
00:15:46,701 --> 00:15:47,828
So hot today...

151
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:48,452
Excuse me.

152
00:15:48,453 --> 00:15:49,785
Be gone!

153
00:15:50,453 --> 00:15:51,909
My apologies, who are you?

154
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:53,493
May I help you?

155
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,829
Could I meet the owner?

156
00:15:56,285 --> 00:15:58,661
Yes, I'm the owner,
what can I do for you?

157
00:15:59,409 --> 00:16:02,409
My sister is really sick.

158
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:05,452
I came here because
I'm at wit's end.

159
00:16:05,453 --> 00:16:06,744
Did Det. Choi tell you about us?

160
00:16:06,745 --> 00:16:08,993
No, Father Mar...

161
00:16:10,493 --> 00:16:14,369
Father Marco recommended us?

162
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:21,785
My apologies, we do not
work with them.

163
00:16:23,077 --> 00:16:23,993
I'm sorry.

164
00:16:26,121 --> 00:16:27,369
My sister is in danger!

165
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:30,369
If you help us,
I'll do anything.

166
00:16:31,161 --> 00:16:32,537
I brought money too.

167
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:34,285
Here.

168
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:36,453
If...

169
00:16:38,661 --> 00:16:42,620
If she's sick,
take her to the hospital.

170
00:16:42,621 --> 00:16:44,368
She should see a neuropsychiatrist.

171
00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:46,121
I'm a neuropsychiatrist!

172
00:16:48,077 --> 00:16:49,409
Christ...

173
00:16:53,453 --> 00:16:54,621
Please...

174
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:02,993
This contains her videos,

175
00:17:04,409 --> 00:17:05,993
please give it to him.

176
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:07,661
I'm begging you.

177
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:09,953
I understand.

178
00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:38,069
Han Eun-seo

179
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,276
This is my sister and my home.

180
00:17:52,277 --> 00:17:54,693
Jung-won and Eun-seo's home.

181
00:17:55,153 --> 00:17:57,069
Let's live happily here.

182
00:17:57,861 --> 00:18:00,028
- Let's never fight.
- Yeah, let's not fight.

183
00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:01,820
Don't steal my clothes.

184
00:18:01,821 --> 00:18:03,401
Don't use my make-up.

185
00:18:06,821 --> 00:18:09,068
We moved today,
so let's be happy.

186
00:18:09,069 --> 00:18:10,693
Let's be happy.

187
00:18:11,401 --> 00:18:13,945
- Thank you, sis.
- Not at all.

188
00:18:16,445 --> 00:18:16,944
You like it?

189
00:18:16,945 --> 00:18:19,821
Yeah, the air is so nice here.

190
00:19:02,511 --> 00:19:07,675
As a fellow doctor, I couldn't
believe it until I saw your sister.

191
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:12,320
Since the Church officially
prohibits exorcism,

192
00:19:12,988 --> 00:19:15,320
I suggested you go to him.

193
00:19:16,236 --> 00:19:19,072
Of course, as a doctor, I know
you must have had doubts...

194
00:19:20,072 --> 00:19:21,860
Devil, exorcism,

195
00:19:22,904 --> 00:19:24,736
I don't know about these things.

196
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,860
I simply want to save
my sister, Father.

197
00:19:37,062 --> 00:19:38,394
- Hey.
- Yes?

198
00:19:39,894 --> 00:19:41,434
Where did Sharon go?

199
00:19:42,434 --> 00:19:43,934
She should be in her office.

200
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,269
By the way, boss,

201
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:50,142
do you want to see the footage
that pretty doctor brought?

202
00:19:50,854 --> 00:19:52,641
Nah, forget it.

203
00:19:52,642 --> 00:19:56,978
But if Father Marco sent her,
it could be something big.

204
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:00,561
Don't ever mention
his name to me again.

205
00:20:00,562 --> 00:20:01,893
I'm sorry.

206
00:20:01,894 --> 00:20:03,769
Where's Sharon,
I need to give this to her.

207
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:04,517
I'm right here.

208
00:20:04,518 --> 00:20:07,354
Holy Jesus!
She's right here...

209
00:20:07,894 --> 00:20:10,602
Could you stop sneaking up on us?

210
00:20:11,226 --> 00:20:12,978
- Sharon
- Kim Goon

211
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:15,061
Here, here.

212
00:20:15,062 --> 00:20:16,933
Your salary,
thank you as always.

213
00:20:16,934 --> 00:20:17,809
Good work.

214
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:18,686
Here.

215
00:20:19,478 --> 00:20:20,601
Put it away.

216
00:20:20,602 --> 00:20:22,186
Why is mine so thin?

217
00:20:23,562 --> 00:20:25,769
Sharon's work is a lot tougher.

218
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,061
She's gotta perform rites
on blades and stuff.

219
00:20:28,062 --> 00:20:29,269
When do I ever do that?

220
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,601
Anyway, she does a lot
of really difficult tasks, thanks.

221
00:20:32,602 --> 00:20:33,726
Take it.

222
00:20:34,226 --> 00:20:36,354
Thank you, bud.

223
00:20:38,434 --> 00:20:40,394
Wait a minute.

224
00:20:40,455 --> 00:20:45,455
Demons and their worshippers
are increasing and getting bolder.

225
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:48,185
They flex their shit
in the middle of the city.

226
00:20:48,186 --> 00:20:50,809
More and more people
are dying, am I right?

227
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:54,270
And our workload is growing too, right?

228
00:20:55,186 --> 00:20:59,018
So, how about a salary bump?

229
00:21:07,938 --> 00:21:11,270
It's been a while, hasn't it?
10 years already.

230
00:21:12,018 --> 00:21:13,478
You haven't changed at all.

231
00:21:15,562 --> 00:21:18,938
Of course, I've had this face
since I was 19.

232
00:21:21,938 --> 00:21:23,854
Your sense of humor
hasn't changed either.

233
00:21:26,686 --> 00:21:28,894
Dr. Han Jung-won came by,
didn't she?

234
00:21:30,146 --> 00:21:34,101
I know you refused
because of me, but her sister...

235
00:21:34,102 --> 00:21:37,770
I no longer want to
get involved with you.

236
00:21:39,102 --> 00:21:41,394
I know you still resent me.

237
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:47,726
I struggled too, so many lives
were lost back then.

238
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:53,623
But I didn't want to accept
that Joseph was involved.

239
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,331
The Joseph we knew
no longer exists.

240
00:21:57,207 --> 00:22:04,083
Only Lucifer, who killed
our angelic children and nuns, remains.

241
00:22:05,999 --> 00:22:07,707
The demon you raised.

242
00:22:09,043 --> 00:22:11,291
I prayed with regrets and tears.

243
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:13,790
The will of God--

244
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,331
Those children...

245
00:22:17,385 --> 00:22:22,053
are all dead, is that the will of God?

246
00:22:23,469 --> 00:22:28,301
Even if you can't forgive me,
can't you help her?

247
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:41,425
Eun-seo!

248
00:22:48,915 --> 00:22:49,884
Park, Kidnapped by
Mysterious Group, Found Dead

249
00:22:49,885 --> 00:22:52,334
Park, Kidnapped by
Mysterious Group, Found Dead
I came to thank you.

250
00:22:52,335 --> 00:22:52,385
I came to thank you.

251
00:22:53,341 --> 00:22:58,925
If it wasn't for you, I might not
have said good bye to my son.

252
00:22:59,717 --> 00:23:02,052
If only we acted sooner...

253
00:23:02,053 --> 00:23:08,133
No, thanks to you,
we recovered his body,

254
00:23:10,053 --> 00:23:15,093
and comforted his soul,
I'm just so thankful.

255
00:23:28,633 --> 00:23:29,676
Archbishop

256
00:23:29,677 --> 00:23:31,093
The Domestic Activities of Unknown Cult.

257
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:34,341
Lucifer - Joseph

258
00:23:58,801 --> 00:24:00,509
Let's not look at it.

259
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:02,841
Holy shit, Sharon!

260
00:24:04,841 --> 00:24:09,469
7 years ago, the boss saved
our lives from the demons.

261
00:24:11,053 --> 00:24:12,133
Spare us!

262
00:24:15,133 --> 00:24:20,425
He saved us from Lucifer,
along with Sister Catalina.

263
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:35,425
If it wasn't for him,
we'd already be dead.

264
00:24:37,341 --> 00:24:39,093
What do we have to be afraid of?

265
00:24:42,469 --> 00:24:45,301
Let's help that doctor.

266
00:24:48,809 --> 00:24:50,885
I really want to help her too.

267
00:25:00,385 --> 00:25:02,553
Observation day 34.

268
00:25:03,761 --> 00:25:05,677
The cause of her symptoms

269
00:25:06,301 --> 00:25:14,132
may have stemmed from
the panic disorder five years ago,

270
00:25:14,133 --> 00:25:19,633
after our mother's passing,
and the stress of moving

271
00:25:21,133 --> 00:25:26,924
along with the stress of
practicing all day

272
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:29,133
for her audition by herself.

273
00:25:39,177 --> 00:25:40,841
Eun-seo, med time.

274
00:25:43,093 --> 00:25:43,761
Eun-seo...

275
00:25:49,469 --> 00:25:50,300
Eun-seo?

276
00:25:50,301 --> 00:25:51,677
Don't talk to me!

277
00:25:57,282 --> 00:25:59,969
I've got a good feeling about this.

278
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:01,913
Wish me luck.

279
00:26:05,789 --> 00:26:07,125
Parcel delivery!

280
00:26:08,997 --> 00:26:10,289
I'll leave it here!

281
00:27:52,957 --> 00:27:54,205
Eun-seo?

282
00:28:01,418 --> 00:28:02,546
Eun-seo!

283
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:06,664
Blair! All lights on!

284
00:28:15,313 --> 00:28:16,416
Eun-seo!

285
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,163
Eun-seo?

286
00:28:51,164 --> 00:28:53,415
- Eun-seo?
- Eun-seo?

287
00:28:53,416 --> 00:28:54,499
Where are you?

288
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,291
- Where are you?
- Where are you?

289
00:28:57,292 --> 00:28:58,123
Eun-seo?

290
00:28:58,124 --> 00:28:58,664
- Eun-seo?
- Eun-seo?

291
00:28:58,708 --> 00:28:59,707
Eun-seo!

292
00:28:59,708 --> 00:29:02,416
- Eun-seo!
- Eun-seo!

293
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:11,915
This is the police,
what is your emergency?

294
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,376
I...

295
00:29:15,416 --> 00:29:16,792
I'm sorry.

296
00:29:18,708 --> 00:29:21,540
Eun-seo, what are you doing there?

297
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,164
Eun-seo?

298
00:29:31,292 --> 00:29:32,792
Are you okay? Eun-seo...

299
00:29:34,916 --> 00:29:36,208
Eun-seo...

300
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:44,792
Eun-seo!

301
00:29:48,584 --> 00:29:52,540
Eun-seo! Are you okay?

302
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:58,747
Crimes committed by
a mysterious group are increasing.

303
00:29:58,748 --> 00:30:02,123
Over 30 police officers
have died in the line of duty,

304
00:30:02,124 --> 00:30:07,375
and countless civilians have
either died or have gone missing.

305
00:30:07,376 --> 00:30:08,500
Kim!

306
00:30:11,855 --> 00:30:12,563
Yes, boss!

307
00:30:16,053 --> 00:30:17,677
Show me the footage.

308
00:30:18,137 --> 00:30:21,012
I want to go home,
let me go home!

309
00:30:21,013 --> 00:30:22,676
I want to go home!

310
00:30:22,677 --> 00:30:24,301
You bitch!

311
00:30:48,385 --> 00:30:50,800
Fire will rain down from heaven,

312
00:30:50,801 --> 00:30:55,637
and demons from hell
will drag people into pits of fire...

313
00:31:15,177 --> 00:31:16,801
Jung-won...

314
00:31:30,677 --> 00:31:33,012
Despite all the treatments,

315
00:31:33,013 --> 00:31:34,929
her deviant behavior must be

316
00:31:36,637 --> 00:31:38,845
attributed to...

317
00:31:40,637 --> 00:31:42,593
my shortcomings...

318
00:31:47,801 --> 00:31:49,261
Take a look at this.

319
00:31:49,721 --> 00:31:51,385
I found another video,

320
00:31:52,721 --> 00:31:53,929
there's a bigger problem.

321
00:31:54,885 --> 00:31:56,176
Thank you so much.

322
00:31:56,177 --> 00:31:59,428
As the landlord,
it's the least we can do.

323
00:31:59,429 --> 00:32:02,261
We aren't anal landlords!

324
00:32:05,682 --> 00:32:11,968
We moved all our big furniture
into the shed out back.

325
00:32:11,969 --> 00:32:15,301
It's really dusty,
and there's still so much stuff...

326
00:32:17,889 --> 00:32:19,016
All done?

327
00:32:19,017 --> 00:32:22,264
Yes, smart home monitoring system
and CCTV are fully operational.

328
00:32:22,265 --> 00:32:23,057
Look at that.

329
00:32:27,949 --> 00:32:29,701
What's happening to her

330
00:32:30,921 --> 00:32:32,092
must be connected to Lucifer.

331
00:32:32,093 --> 00:32:33,296
must be connected to Lucifer.
A fallen angel who rules Hell

332
00:32:33,297 --> 00:32:36,465
A fallen angel who rules Hell

333
00:32:36,881 --> 00:32:38,133
Joseph...

334
00:32:39,673 --> 00:32:43,420
Ba-woo grew up in the orphanage
with Joseph,

335
00:32:43,421 --> 00:32:46,421
a boy 3 years younger than him.

336
00:32:47,381 --> 00:32:51,796
Sister Angela raised them both
like her own children.

337
00:32:51,797 --> 00:32:54,921
They were both among the chosen few.

338
00:32:56,297 --> 00:33:02,920
Ba-woo had the physicality
and strength like a rock,

339
00:33:02,921 --> 00:33:08,173
while Joseph had the ability
to draw demons out of people.

340
00:33:09,133 --> 00:33:12,881
Other kids were scared of Joseph
and shunned him,

341
00:33:13,549 --> 00:33:20,549
but Ba-woo always protected him,
and they grew as close as brothers.

342
00:33:22,173 --> 00:33:25,172
Joseph chose the path of priesthood,

343
00:33:25,173 --> 00:33:30,420
while Ba-woo used his fists to earn
money in the underground world,

344
00:33:30,421 --> 00:33:33,341
and always looked after
the orphanage and Joseph.

345
00:33:34,505 --> 00:33:38,133
Ba-woo would visit the orphanage
every Christmas...

346
00:33:39,421 --> 00:33:40,380
No!

347
00:33:40,381 --> 00:33:45,049
But 15 years ago,
Joseph summoned the devil,

348
00:33:45,297 --> 00:33:50,381
and massacred the orphans and
Sister Angela before disappearing.

349
00:34:16,203 --> 00:34:20,118
Ba-woo miraculously survived

350
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:26,490
but consumed by the guilt
for failing to save his loved ones,

351
00:34:26,491 --> 00:34:30,990
he began hunting down Joseph
and slaying demons.

352
00:34:30,991 --> 00:34:33,119
Help me...

353
00:35:38,991 --> 00:35:41,866
Joseph absorbed the vitality of others,

354
00:35:41,867 --> 00:35:44,742
to increase the evil power
inside him.

355
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:49,243
Foolishly, I didn't want to believe
he was capable of such evil.

356
00:35:50,327 --> 00:35:54,411
That's why I could not
disclose this to the Order.

357
00:35:55,451 --> 00:35:59,867
During that time, he disappeared,
and Ba-woo found out later,

358
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:06,703
and it's very likely he rejected you
because of me.

359
00:36:20,036 --> 00:36:21,189
Hello?

360
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:21,199
Hello?
This is Holy Night's Kang Ba-woo.

361
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,190
This is Holy Night's Kang Ba-woo.

362
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:26,774
Could we meet for a bit?

363
00:36:31,902 --> 00:36:34,262
Catholic Seoul Hospital
Neuropsychiatry Center

364
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:37,824
The exorcism will be
performed by Sharon.

365
00:36:38,992 --> 00:36:41,784
And Kim will assist you
by your side.

366
00:36:44,284 --> 00:36:46,239
I didn't get to tell you earlier,

367
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:52,240
but in cases like this,
demons and their worshippers

368
00:36:52,259 --> 00:36:56,343
could appear near Eun-seo,
so I need to keep them at bay.

369
00:36:57,259 --> 00:37:01,674
She has a special ability
to sense evil.

370
00:37:01,675 --> 00:37:04,095
She knows how to fight them
better than anyone.

371
00:37:08,011 --> 00:37:11,219
Turn your eyes white,
you know, to show her we're legit.

372
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,686
I can't do that now.

373
00:37:13,438 --> 00:37:14,730
Right...

374
00:37:14,978 --> 00:37:20,185
It's a dangerous ritual,
you and Eun-seo could be at risk.

375
00:37:20,186 --> 00:37:22,770
We're always risking our lives.

376
00:37:23,978 --> 00:37:25,606
Are you still willing to do it?

377
00:37:31,314 --> 00:37:36,438
Yes, if it means saving my sister.

378
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:40,229
Our lives are on the line too...

379
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,105
- Anyway, Kim.
- Yes?

380
00:37:41,106 --> 00:37:42,230
Get the briefing ready.

381
00:37:48,938 --> 00:37:54,814
What's certain is, a demon has
settled in her body.

382
00:37:55,354 --> 00:37:57,522
Why did this happen to her?

383
00:37:57,814 --> 00:37:59,686
Have any strangers
ever enter your home?

384
00:38:00,186 --> 00:38:03,478
No, it's a remote house,
we don't have any guests.

385
00:38:05,821 --> 00:38:08,945
It seems these people
summoned a demon through her.

386
00:38:09,615 --> 00:38:13,407
We don't know who these people are
until we figure out their symbol.

387
00:38:13,425 --> 00:38:17,133
They're always around us
posing as good neighbors.

388
00:38:18,451 --> 00:38:20,450
We call them 'worshippers'.

389
00:38:20,451 --> 00:38:23,114
They worship the devil,
obedient to demons,

390
00:38:23,115 --> 00:38:25,823
cause harm to people
and spread evil.

391
00:38:26,699 --> 00:38:32,283
These worshippers are trained
like soldiers and harm people.

392
00:38:32,808 --> 00:38:36,559
So-called 'Demons' are bishops
that control various regions,

393
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,224
and they're closer to
evil deities than humans.

394
00:38:39,516 --> 00:38:44,352
They follow the archbishop's orders
to select the sacrifice and lead all rituals.

395
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,184
But why go after Eun-seo?

396
00:38:47,371 --> 00:38:53,233
For thousands of years, they've used
pure and vulnerable souls like Eun-seo

397
00:38:53,234 --> 00:38:53,246
For thousands of years, they've used
pure and vulnerable souls like Eun-seo
as a medium to summon demons
and reshape the world.

398
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:55,982
as a medium to summon demons
and reshape the world.

399
00:38:57,053 --> 00:38:58,801
Anyone can be a target.

400
00:39:00,845 --> 00:39:03,013
We'll have to meet her.

401
00:39:06,013 --> 00:39:10,345
Eun-seo, are you awake?

402
00:39:12,761 --> 00:39:14,513
Can you hear me?

403
00:39:16,013 --> 00:39:16,929
Yes...

404
00:39:17,513 --> 00:39:23,301
I came to help you,
could we chat for a bit?

405
00:39:24,885 --> 00:39:26,221
Yes...

406
00:39:26,845 --> 00:39:30,969
Aside from me, is there
anyone else talking to you?

407
00:39:34,013 --> 00:39:35,013
Yes...

408
00:39:36,593 --> 00:39:37,513
Who is that?

409
00:39:38,513 --> 00:39:39,845
I don't know...

410
00:39:41,013 --> 00:39:42,553
I can't tell you.

411
00:39:43,637 --> 00:39:47,301
Could I talk to that person?

412
00:39:49,301 --> 00:39:50,177
You can't.

413
00:39:50,929 --> 00:39:52,093
Why not?

414
00:39:54,093 --> 00:39:55,221
I'm scared...

415
00:39:58,301 --> 00:40:03,429
If he responds to me,
he will leave your body.

416
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:05,677
Don't you want him to leave?

417
00:40:06,513 --> 00:40:11,053
I'm... so scared...

418
00:40:15,761 --> 00:40:17,301
I'll begin.

419
00:40:23,177 --> 00:40:24,637
Who are you?

420
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:31,261
Answer me, who are you?

421
00:40:32,969 --> 00:40:34,137
Answer me!

422
00:40:52,247 --> 00:40:56,123
Do not hide behind the child,
and answer me, who are you?

423
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,592
Why are you doing this to me?

424
00:41:10,352 --> 00:41:12,352
I haven't done anything wrong.

425
00:41:50,352 --> 00:41:52,519
Vile demon.

426
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:56,352
Reveal your name
and return to hell.

427
00:41:56,644 --> 00:41:59,019
Vile demon.

428
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:02,560
Reveal your name
and return to hell.

429
00:42:12,688 --> 00:42:13,727
Eun-seo...

430
00:42:13,728 --> 00:42:14,896
No, doctor!

431
00:42:32,604 --> 00:42:34,188
Vile demon!

432
00:42:35,396 --> 00:42:40,395
Reveal your name
and return to hell!

433
00:42:40,396 --> 00:42:42,103
Vile demon!

434
00:42:42,104 --> 00:42:46,476
Reveal your name
and return to hell!

435
00:42:47,911 --> 00:42:50,951
Reveal your name
and return...

436
00:43:16,535 --> 00:43:18,618
Where is she right now?

437
00:43:18,619 --> 00:43:19,203
It's near the entrance.

438
00:43:30,035 --> 00:43:31,287
What do we do?

439
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:45,075
She's trying to get out!

440
00:44:12,787 --> 00:44:13,743
Get off me!

441
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:21,995
Get going!

442
00:44:52,787 --> 00:44:53,911
Doctor!

443
00:44:54,867 --> 00:44:55,951
Doctor!

444
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,495
Eun-seo!

445
00:45:08,951 --> 00:45:10,119
Wait!

446
00:45:11,411 --> 00:45:12,159
Eun-seo!

447
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:15,327
Jung-won!

448
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:28,743
No!

449
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:31,367
Eun-seo!

450
00:45:34,306 --> 00:45:35,722
Eun-seo!

451
00:45:36,138 --> 00:45:37,722
It's too dangerous!

452
00:45:39,222 --> 00:45:42,970
I'll come to you,
stay right there!

453
00:45:46,638 --> 00:45:49,054
Sis, I'm scared...

454
00:46:10,638 --> 00:46:11,470
Eun-seo!

455
00:46:17,806 --> 00:46:21,262
Eun-seo!

456
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:41,963
- Jung-won!
- Doctor!

457
00:46:42,879 --> 00:46:45,171
Jung-won, are you okay?

458
00:46:47,021 --> 00:46:48,105
Sir, are you hurt at all?

459
00:46:50,083 --> 00:46:55,083
The demon is so deeply entrenched,
I can't tell what it is.

460
00:46:56,207 --> 00:46:58,375
We must end it where it all started.

461
00:46:59,419 --> 00:47:03,043
Staying at the hospital will put her
and other patients at risk.

462
00:47:04,375 --> 00:47:06,251
Yes, let's do that.

463
00:47:07,127 --> 00:47:08,335
We have to move,
there's no time.

464
00:47:33,751 --> 00:47:35,043
Eun-seo...

465
00:47:37,219 --> 00:47:40,135
Hang in there a little longer.

466
00:48:05,675 --> 00:48:08,134
Dammit!

467
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,551
I just can't tell
where they'll come from.

468
00:48:37,343 --> 00:48:39,175
It's no use.

469
00:49:12,219 --> 00:49:13,591
Eun-seo...

470
00:49:18,219 --> 00:49:19,675
Mister...

471
00:49:22,467 --> 00:49:24,051
Save me...

472
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:37,339
I'll save you no matter what.

473
00:49:43,419 --> 00:49:45,963
There are 6 stages of exorcism.

474
00:49:47,255 --> 00:49:52,002
The goal of each stage is to
make the demon reveal its name,

475
00:49:52,003 --> 00:49:54,047
and expelling it from Eun-seo's body.

476
00:49:54,919 --> 00:49:58,211
Please follow my orders
at every stage.

477
00:49:59,087 --> 00:50:01,631
Once we start the exorcism,
it must not be stopped.

478
00:50:02,547 --> 00:50:09,671
If it stops, her life and ours
may be in grave danger.

479
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:14,794
Presence

480
00:50:14,795 --> 00:50:17,046
Presence
The first stage is 'Presence'.

481
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:18,214
Presence
We force the demon
to reveal itself.

482
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:18,755
We force the demon
to reveal itself.

483
00:50:19,631 --> 00:50:24,087
Sis, I'm scared...

484
00:50:24,547 --> 00:50:27,378
Please send them all away...

485
00:50:27,379 --> 00:50:29,255
I'm so scared...

486
00:50:30,587 --> 00:50:32,170
Eun-seo, it's okay.

487
00:50:32,171 --> 00:50:34,131
Doctor, don't answer the demon.

488
00:50:39,171 --> 00:50:40,463
Kim, everything ready?

489
00:50:41,295 --> 00:50:42,295
Yes.

490
00:50:45,295 --> 00:50:46,003
Jung-won.

491
00:50:47,755 --> 00:50:49,463
Jung-won?

492
00:50:50,131 --> 00:50:52,087
I mean, I'm not a demon.

493
00:50:52,419 --> 00:50:53,463
Yes?

494
00:50:53,755 --> 00:50:54,919
Turn on the machine.

495
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:56,587
Okay.

496
00:50:58,879 --> 00:51:00,671
Her vitals are within normal range.

497
00:51:02,211 --> 00:51:03,295
Let's begin.

498
00:51:05,379 --> 00:51:07,503
You must answer all my questions.

499
00:51:08,339 --> 00:51:10,171
Or you will feel intense pain.

500
00:51:12,171 --> 00:51:13,170
A bamboo that wards off
evil and malevolent energies

501
00:51:13,171 --> 00:51:15,918
A bamboo that wards off
evil and malevolent energies
Do not touch me, no!

502
00:51:15,919 --> 00:51:16,839
A bamboo that wards off
evil and malevolent energies

503
00:51:17,295 --> 00:51:18,131
Tell me your name!

504
00:51:18,755 --> 00:51:19,339
Tell me!

505
00:51:26,919 --> 00:51:27,918
What happened?

506
00:51:27,919 --> 00:51:28,586
We're entering 'Deception' stage.

507
00:51:28,587 --> 00:51:29,586
We're entering 'Deception' stage.
Deception

508
00:51:29,587 --> 00:51:31,086
Deception

509
00:51:31,087 --> 00:51:32,090
Deception
The evil will try to deceive us.

510
00:51:32,091 --> 00:51:32,547
The evil will try to deceive us.

511
00:51:56,671 --> 00:51:57,962
Jung-won...

512
00:51:57,963 --> 00:52:00,754
I'm so scared...

513
00:52:00,755 --> 00:52:03,003
Could you untie me?

514
00:52:16,211 --> 00:52:19,131
A small mirror
imbued with the shaman's soul

515
00:52:26,879 --> 00:52:33,295
An act to convey
the words of the guardian spirit

516
00:52:44,818 --> 00:52:48,154
You want to know my name?
Should I tell you?

517
00:52:52,621 --> 00:52:54,329
The demon isn't pretending.

518
00:52:59,131 --> 00:53:01,883
Before existence,

519
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:04,047
I was the first being.

520
00:53:08,507 --> 00:53:11,591
I am both one and infinite.

521
00:53:12,383 --> 00:53:14,507
I am eternity and finality.

522
00:53:15,715 --> 00:53:18,091
I am within you,

523
00:53:19,091 --> 00:53:23,339
I am not within you.

524
00:54:03,799 --> 00:54:05,547
The interior lights are being shut off.

525
00:54:07,591 --> 00:54:08,715
Something's odd.

526
00:54:09,507 --> 00:54:11,383
I'll look into it,

527
00:54:12,671 --> 00:54:14,131
stay on guard.

528
00:54:15,383 --> 00:54:16,547
Okay.

529
00:54:46,684 --> 00:54:48,056
There you were.

530
00:54:52,338 --> 00:54:53,422
Dammit...

531
00:55:15,515 --> 00:55:20,307
I exist everywhere, and nowhere.

532
00:55:30,358 --> 00:55:31,898
You vile demon.

533
00:55:32,724 --> 00:55:35,680
Reveal your name at once,

534
00:55:36,264 --> 00:55:37,848
and expel from the girl.

535
00:56:11,172 --> 00:56:14,588
You're too chicken shit
to come in here.

536
00:56:14,615 --> 00:56:17,823
Come in, do it.- Come in, do it.

537
00:56:41,468 --> 00:56:45,424
Petty priests like you
can never defeat us.

538
00:57:21,756 --> 00:57:24,256
The demon within,

539
00:57:24,632 --> 00:57:26,592
release her at once!

540
00:57:27,216 --> 00:57:30,132
Expel yourself!

541
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:33,424
The demon within,

542
00:57:34,592 --> 00:57:37,424
release her at once!

543
00:57:37,884 --> 00:57:39,800
Expel yourself!

544
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:10,903
Hey, it's me.

545
00:58:11,062 --> 00:58:12,876
Boss, are you okay?

546
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:18,864
Yeah, I'm fine now.

547
00:58:21,655 --> 00:58:23,862
Boss, I told you once before,

548
00:58:23,863 --> 00:58:26,818
always watch out for
the powder they throw at you.

549
00:58:26,819 --> 00:58:30,155
It could paralyze you,
and you could even die from it.

550
00:58:30,255 --> 00:58:31,879
All right, get on with it.

551
00:58:32,487 --> 00:58:33,531
Okay.

552
00:58:38,903 --> 00:58:40,863
Now it's the third stage,
'Break Point'.

553
00:58:41,739 --> 00:58:44,571
You should use this moment
to get some rest.

554
00:58:46,487 --> 00:58:48,987
Break Point

555
00:58:51,686 --> 00:58:53,434
Jung-won?

556
00:58:57,193 --> 00:58:58,733
Are you okay?

557
00:59:09,149 --> 00:59:10,064
I command you

558
00:59:10,065 --> 00:59:11,941
in the name of our almighty creators,

559
00:59:12,985 --> 00:59:14,941
return to the netherworld!

560
00:59:15,277 --> 00:59:16,065
Return at once!

561
00:59:22,065 --> 00:59:24,609
Jung-won, wake up!

562
00:59:26,485 --> 00:59:28,193
Doctor, it's okay,
everything's fine.

563
00:59:28,525 --> 00:59:31,149
The demon entered
your body momentarily.

564
00:59:32,565 --> 00:59:35,357
They sometimes target
a family member during the exorcism.

565
00:59:38,277 --> 00:59:40,317
There's something else
in the house.

566
01:00:28,941 --> 01:00:30,276
- Bud.
- Yes?

567
01:00:30,277 --> 01:00:31,648
Don't read that.

568
01:00:31,649 --> 01:00:32,733
Okay.

569
01:00:33,609 --> 01:00:35,440
What does it mean?

570
01:00:35,441 --> 01:00:36,693
I'm not sure.

571
01:00:37,609 --> 01:00:39,525
It's an ancient language called 'Igbo'.

572
01:00:40,357 --> 01:00:44,109
This is why all these unexpected
events kept happening.

573
01:00:44,213 --> 01:00:46,507
There is a curse
on the entire house.

574
01:00:49,051 --> 01:00:50,882
What do we do then?

575
01:00:50,883 --> 01:00:53,259
We have to remove
all of these symbols.

576
01:01:30,449 --> 01:01:33,029
Did something happen to me?

577
01:01:35,157 --> 01:01:37,529
It felt like something
left my body.

578
01:01:38,321 --> 01:01:40,696
Eun-seo, are you okay?

579
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:41,865
Feeling better?

580
01:01:42,443 --> 01:01:43,405
Wait.

581
01:01:45,489 --> 01:01:46,905
Jung-won...

582
01:01:51,613 --> 01:01:53,321
Could you untie me?

583
01:01:54,573 --> 01:01:57,364
Eun-seo, is that you?
Do you recognize me?

584
01:01:57,365 --> 01:01:58,529
Hold on.

585
01:02:18,657 --> 01:02:22,029
This bitch will die
one way or another.

586
01:02:25,027 --> 01:02:26,113
Remember?

587
01:02:27,529 --> 01:02:30,781
You let all those poor children die.

588
01:02:33,113 --> 01:02:33,404
'Voice' stage has begun.

589
01:02:33,405 --> 01:02:35,364
'Voice' stage has begun.
Voice

590
01:02:35,365 --> 01:02:38,281
Voice

591
01:02:40,489 --> 01:02:44,821
Mister, save me...

592
01:02:46,197 --> 01:02:48,405
Help me, Mr. Ba-woo!

593
01:02:56,405 --> 01:03:01,280
Joseph killed them?
No, you killed them.

594
01:03:01,281 --> 01:03:04,741
They all died because
you couldn't stop him.

595
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:09,196
Let's go visit him together.

596
01:03:09,197 --> 01:03:11,528
Then you can achieve eternal life.

597
01:03:11,529 --> 01:03:14,864
If not, you'll end up killing
this child too.

598
01:03:14,865 --> 01:03:17,489
Just like you killed Sister Angela,
your mother figure.

599
01:03:21,643 --> 01:03:27,935
Kill! Kill! Kill!

600
01:03:28,469 --> 01:03:30,305
Boss!- Kill!

601
01:03:31,013 --> 01:03:35,429
- Boss, boss, no!
- Kill!

602
01:03:39,699 --> 01:03:40,991
Sharon!

603
01:03:49,032 --> 01:03:52,448
Boss, I'm okay.

604
01:03:54,784 --> 01:03:56,368
Do not fall prey to its delusion.

605
01:04:06,616 --> 01:04:12,408
Daggers imbued
with a divine spirit

606
01:04:36,115 --> 01:04:41,155
Why are you siding with humans?

607
01:04:41,575 --> 01:04:46,323
Your power did not come from him,

608
01:04:47,283 --> 01:04:50,407
but from my brother!

609
01:04:56,699 --> 01:04:59,863
If my power came from your brother,

610
01:05:01,407 --> 01:05:06,823
it proves he couldn't defeat me.

611
01:05:08,177 --> 01:05:14,508
Do you think you can handle

612
01:05:14,509 --> 01:05:16,425
that much power?

613
01:05:44,009 --> 01:05:45,009
Here you go.

614
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:49,069
What's this?

615
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:49,079
What's this?
A lid.

616
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:50,154
A lid.

617
01:05:51,110 --> 01:05:52,318
Why did you bring a lid?

618
01:05:53,070 --> 01:05:54,654
You said to bring
something to cover.

619
01:05:55,946 --> 01:05:59,362
I meant a coat to cover
her body, you moron.

620
01:06:15,931 --> 01:06:17,599
Why do you waste your life

621
01:06:19,347 --> 01:06:22,515
on these pathetic beings?

622
01:06:23,723 --> 01:06:26,639
You know it eats away your body,

623
01:06:27,391 --> 01:06:29,763
as you use your power.

624
01:06:30,971 --> 01:06:32,763
You've felt it,

625
01:06:33,971 --> 01:06:36,723
is it worth saving these humans,

626
01:06:37,263 --> 01:06:38,971
who are wicked and greedy?

627
01:06:39,971 --> 01:06:42,139
Be with us, sister.

628
01:06:44,183 --> 01:06:45,639
Be with us.

629
01:06:46,639 --> 01:06:48,891
I am not your sister.

630
01:06:51,891 --> 01:06:53,471
Get out of my head!

631
01:07:09,744 --> 01:07:10,996
Reveal your name!

632
01:07:11,828 --> 01:07:13,580
I'll make this pain go away!

633
01:07:14,503 --> 01:07:17,083
Tell me your name, now!

634
01:07:19,909 --> 01:07:24,241
Tell me your name!

635
01:07:25,201 --> 01:07:26,865
Tell me!

636
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:28,766
What's your name!

637
01:07:29,852 --> 01:07:32,227
Jung-won, please...

638
01:07:32,228 --> 01:07:33,228
Save me...

639
01:07:33,279 --> 01:07:34,115
Stop it! Please!

640
01:07:38,178 --> 01:07:39,097
- Jung-won!
- You can't!

641
01:07:39,098 --> 01:07:40,221
It's not over yet!

642
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:41,262
The boundary...

643
01:08:08,098 --> 01:08:09,598
Wait.

644
01:08:13,304 --> 01:08:14,596
Step back.

645
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:40,760
This bitch is mine now.

646
01:09:04,928 --> 01:09:06,635
We're now in 'Clash' stage.

647
01:09:06,636 --> 01:09:06,803
We need to find her quickly.

648
01:09:06,804 --> 01:09:08,011
We need to find her quickly.
Clash

649
01:09:08,012 --> 01:09:11,304
Clash

650
01:09:15,552 --> 01:09:16,928
Sharon...

651
01:09:31,473 --> 01:09:32,849
With your power,

652
01:09:33,641 --> 01:09:35,473
we can rule the world.

653
01:09:36,805 --> 01:09:38,721
Be with us, sister.

654
01:09:40,557 --> 01:09:42,641
Be with us.

655
01:10:16,732 --> 01:10:18,232
Boss, we're locked in!

656
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:20,300
Move out of the way.

657
01:10:21,048 --> 01:10:24,048
I'm doing a lot of
home degrading today.

658
01:10:31,424 --> 01:10:33,007
Wait, boss!

659
01:10:33,008 --> 01:10:33,672
What is it?

660
01:10:39,008 --> 01:10:40,300
It's an automatic door.

661
01:10:41,508 --> 01:10:42,840
Dammit...

662
01:10:46,632 --> 01:10:47,880
Jung-won...

663
01:11:00,172 --> 01:11:02,924
Eun-seo, are you in there?

664
01:11:24,132 --> 01:11:25,464
Eun-seo!- Jung-won!

665
01:11:41,191 --> 01:11:42,399
Hey, hey!

666
01:11:53,607 --> 01:11:55,147
- Are you okay?
- You good?

667
01:11:56,607 --> 01:11:58,191
I'm fine, doctor...

668
01:11:58,429 --> 01:12:00,385
Is there a room
we don't know about?

669
01:12:03,637 --> 01:12:11,177
We moved all our big furniture
into the shed out back.

670
01:12:13,721 --> 01:12:14,429
Shed...

671
01:12:33,659 --> 01:12:35,177
Over there!

672
01:12:43,293 --> 01:12:44,793
What's that?

673
01:12:45,747 --> 01:12:47,707
The demon is taking
more control over her.

674
01:13:10,291 --> 01:13:11,246
Eun-seo...

675
01:13:11,247 --> 01:13:12,831
Doctor, no! No!

676
01:13:44,591 --> 01:13:46,007
So, this is where you hang out.

677
01:13:58,849 --> 01:14:01,348
Wounded soul,

678
01:14:01,349 --> 01:14:06,221
why do you use the power
devil has given you on humans?

679
01:14:08,545 --> 01:14:09,917
Are you Korean?

680
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:16,535
If you interfere with us,
only death awaits you.

681
01:15:29,159 --> 01:15:31,199
Go, kill Sharon.

682
01:15:40,378 --> 01:15:43,210
Die, die, feel the terror.

683
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:49,284
Die, die, feel the terror.

684
01:16:04,489 --> 01:16:09,241
Ba-woo! Die!

685
01:17:00,781 --> 01:17:02,617
Die!

686
01:17:13,241 --> 01:17:14,241
Sharon!

687
01:17:31,949 --> 01:17:32,989
Boss...

688
01:17:35,241 --> 01:17:36,988
Blood, you're bleeding!

689
01:17:36,989 --> 01:17:38,157
What do we do, boss?

690
01:17:52,738 --> 01:17:55,614
I am your Omega.

691
01:17:59,154 --> 01:18:01,278
You are my Alpha.

692
01:18:06,654 --> 01:18:09,862
I am the new path.

693
01:18:12,778 --> 01:18:14,237
With my kingdom

694
01:18:14,238 --> 01:18:15,862
created with blood of children,

695
01:18:18,278 --> 01:18:20,406
I will rule you all.

696
01:18:31,909 --> 01:18:33,241
Now I get it.

697
01:18:35,030 --> 01:18:36,614
I know who you are.

698
01:18:38,466 --> 01:18:40,089
We're in the final stage, 'Expulsion'.

699
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:40,257
We're in the final stage, 'Expulsion'.
Expulsion

700
01:18:40,258 --> 01:18:41,297
Expulsion

701
01:18:41,298 --> 01:18:43,921
Expulsion
After this stage,
we can save Eun-seo.

702
01:18:43,922 --> 01:18:43,926
Expulsion

703
01:18:45,422 --> 01:18:51,590
A foul deity of death
that takes child sacrifices.

704
01:18:54,538 --> 01:18:55,246
Moloch!

705
01:19:02,498 --> 01:19:04,414
Your time is up.

706
01:19:35,458 --> 01:19:37,498
Return to where you came from!

707
01:19:38,195 --> 01:19:40,031
I expel you, Moloch!

708
01:19:40,819 --> 01:19:42,487
Return to hell at once!

709
01:19:42,903 --> 01:19:44,655
Return to hell, Moloch!

710
01:19:48,531 --> 01:19:50,403
Return to where you came from!

711
01:19:51,031 --> 01:19:52,655
I expel you, Moloch!

712
01:19:53,695 --> 01:19:55,487
Return to hell at once!

713
01:19:56,447 --> 01:19:58,279
Return to hell, Moloch!

714
01:19:59,987 --> 01:20:01,239
I expel you, Moloch!

715
01:20:05,531 --> 01:20:07,447
Return to where you came from!

716
01:20:08,611 --> 01:20:10,111
I expel you, Moloch!

717
01:20:20,987 --> 01:20:23,031
Return to hell!

718
01:20:24,111 --> 01:20:26,279
At once, Moloch!

719
01:20:27,779 --> 01:20:29,195
I expel you!

720
01:20:38,403 --> 01:20:40,403
- Eun-seo!
- Not yet!

721
01:20:41,185 --> 01:20:42,561
The demon is being expelled.

722
01:21:14,937 --> 01:21:19,808
Defeated by petty exorcists!

723
01:21:19,809 --> 01:21:25,309
I will one day shred you all!

724
01:21:29,236 --> 01:21:34,988
And I am taking this bitch to hell.

725
01:21:36,028 --> 01:21:38,320
She's mine.

726
01:21:46,864 --> 01:21:48,028
Eun-seo!

727
01:21:48,696 --> 01:21:49,656
Sharon!

728
01:22:07,904 --> 01:22:09,656
