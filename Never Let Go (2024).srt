1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000


2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000


3
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:45,691
<i>First, it came to Momma
as a snake.</i>

4
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:50,630
<i>Then it took other forms
to torment her.</i>

5
00:00:53,368 --> 00:00:56,407
<i>But Momma
was a good little girl.</i>

6
00:00:56,407 --> 00:00:59,474
<i>She listened to her parents
and always stayed on the rope.</i>

7
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,972
<i>So, the Evil couldn't
touch her outside the house.</i>

8
00:01:06,414 --> 00:01:08,120
<i>Because if the Evil touches you...</i>

9
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:13,524
<i>it makes you do bad things.</i>

10
00:01:32,144 --> 00:01:35,439
<i>O blessed house
of ancient wood.</i>

11
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,313
Shelter to the pure and good.

12
00:01:39,313 --> 00:01:42,721
We'll keep you bright
and never roam.

13
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:45,685
Heaven is here, within our home.

14
00:04:28,682 --> 00:04:32,423
Samuel, Nolan,
10-minute warning, boys.

15
00:04:44,938 --> 00:04:46,503
Nine-minute warning, Nolan.

16
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:56,676
<i>Momma says there's only love
inside of us.</i>

17
00:04:56,676 --> 00:04:59,109
<i>That's why the Evil
wants us so badly.</i>

18
00:05:01,614 --> 00:05:04,155
<i>He wants to destroy this love.</i>

19
00:05:04,155 --> 00:05:05,822
<i>Make us turn
against each other.</i>

20
00:05:06,923 --> 00:05:07,887
<i>Kill each other.</i>

21
00:05:11,627 --> 00:05:13,695
<i>Like it made the people
in the world do.</i>

22
00:05:23,872 --> 00:05:27,840
<i>All it needs is one touch,
without the rope on.</i>

23
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,542
<i>And then, not even the house
can save you.</i>

24
00:07:27,593 --> 00:07:28,533
Get it.

25
00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:31,195
There you go.

26
00:07:32,435 --> 00:07:34,132
Frogs sang loud last night.

27
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:36,431
Spring is coming.

28
00:07:37,108 --> 00:07:38,604
We'll be ready.

29
00:07:38,604 --> 00:07:40,006
It's a good day for a good day.

30
00:07:45,282 --> 00:07:46,778
Don't feed the dog.

31
00:07:46,778 --> 00:07:48,685
We're not
the only ones starving.

32
00:07:53,051 --> 00:07:54,889
And I don't need to eat
as much as you.

33
00:08:00,492 --> 00:08:01,456
Momma?

34
00:08:02,632 --> 00:08:04,997
Momma, can we listen
to it tonight?

35
00:08:04,997 --> 00:08:07,003
-It's not new moon.
- I'm asking Momma.

36
00:08:07,003 --> 00:08:08,601
We should wait.

37
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:10,171
It won't be special if we don't.

38
00:08:10,171 --> 00:08:11,510
Told ya.

39
00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:26,382
You'll grow into 'em.

40
00:08:57,016 --> 00:08:59,421
The Evil
can't touch me here,

41
00:08:59,421 --> 00:09:01,523
dawn to night and year to year.

42
00:09:01,523 --> 00:09:04,153
The forest
with its dangers abound,

43
00:09:04,153 --> 00:09:06,862
wrapped up tight
and safe and sound.

44
00:09:43,729 --> 00:09:44,669
Do you see it?

45
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,785
Go get 'em, Koda.
Bring us a big, fat rabbit.

46
00:10:05,653 --> 00:10:06,823
Y'all ready?

47
00:10:11,658 --> 00:10:12,994
Never let go.

48
00:10:14,496 --> 00:10:15,832
Never let go.

49
00:11:20,198 --> 00:11:21,557
<i>Momma told us</i>

50
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:23,631
<i>that even before the Evil
possessed everyone,</i>

51
00:11:23,631 --> 00:11:25,495
<i>the world was already bad.</i>

52
00:11:26,932 --> 00:11:28,132
<i>And that's why it came.</i>

53
00:11:28,132 --> 00:11:29,703
<i>The people opened
their door for it,</i>

54
00:11:29,703 --> 00:11:31,237
<i>whether they knew it or not.</i>

55
00:11:35,405 --> 00:11:36,847
Let them go.

56
00:11:40,177 --> 00:11:42,082
<i>But Grandma knew it.</i>

57
00:11:42,082 --> 00:11:44,382
<i>And Grandpa was the only one
to believe her.</i>

58
00:11:49,356 --> 00:11:52,656
<i>He was a good man
and built this place for her.</i>

59
00:11:52,656 --> 00:11:55,591
<i>A blessed house where the Evil
wouldn't be able to come in.</i>

60
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,229
<i>A place to raise a family,</i>

61
00:11:58,229 --> 00:12:00,431
<i>far away from the darkness
of the world.</i>

62
00:12:04,277 --> 00:12:06,042
<i>It was a good life.</i>

63
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:08,675
<i>But after a while, Grandma
started to feel a presence</i>

64
00:12:08,675 --> 00:12:10,078
<i>lurking in the woods.</i>

65
00:12:10,942 --> 00:12:12,113
<i>Something evil,</i>

66
00:12:12,813 --> 00:12:14,443
<i>getting stronger.</i>

67
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:17,083
<i>She refused to leave
the house anymore.</i>

68
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,082
<i>So, Grandpa figured out
how to tie a rope</i>

69
00:12:19,082 --> 00:12:21,086
<i>to the foundation of the house,</i>

70
00:12:21,086 --> 00:12:23,058
<i>so she could finally
go outside.</i>

71
00:12:38,602 --> 00:12:41,406
Let them go, Junebug.

72
00:13:09,702 --> 00:13:10,875
Whoo!

73
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,675
Whoo-hoo!

74
00:15:09,954 --> 00:15:10,929
Nolan.

75
00:15:12,498 --> 00:15:13,930
What are you doing?

76
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:16,057
Making some slack
so I can grab this egg.

77
00:15:16,057 --> 00:15:17,232
Don't.

78
00:15:19,097 --> 00:15:20,396
Could be a trick.

79
00:15:20,396 --> 00:15:22,572
I could grab it.
It's right there.

80
00:15:22,572 --> 00:15:24,031
Give me your machete.

81
00:15:24,031 --> 00:15:25,009
No.

82
00:15:26,941 --> 00:15:28,304
We'll let Momma decide.

83
00:15:28,304 --> 00:15:30,245
She can tie the ropes together.

84
00:15:44,464 --> 00:15:45,854
I wasn't gonna let go.

85
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:49,800
We didn't get this far
just to die of hunger.

86
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,769
How can you be so sure
of everything?

87
00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:53,263
Because
I'm older than you.

88
00:15:53,263 --> 00:15:55,435
Yeah. By three minutes.

89
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,872
She loves me more.

90
00:16:04,448 --> 00:16:05,379
What?

91
00:16:07,143 --> 00:16:08,118
What?

92
00:16:08,685 --> 00:16:09,812
What did you say?

93
00:16:12,283 --> 00:16:13,524
I didn't say anything.

94
00:16:28,505 --> 00:16:29,469
Sam!

95
00:16:32,836 --> 00:16:33,938
Sam!

96
00:16:39,318 --> 00:16:40,348
Sam!

97
00:16:45,425 --> 00:16:46,519
Nolan!

98
00:16:47,018 --> 00:16:48,059
Samuel!

99
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,894
Sam!

100
00:16:57,193 --> 00:16:58,432
My rope.

101
00:17:09,942 --> 00:17:11,648
Samuel!

102
00:17:16,385 --> 00:17:17,616
Sam!

103
00:17:18,588 --> 00:17:20,058
Sam!

104
00:17:22,295 --> 00:17:23,560
Samuel!

105
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,591
- Samuel!
- Sam! Sam.

106
00:17:28,525 --> 00:17:30,200
Come on.

107
00:17:32,195 --> 00:17:33,137
Nolan!

108
00:17:33,867 --> 00:17:34,902
Run!

109
00:17:34,902 --> 00:17:36,635
Get back on the rope!

110
00:17:59,597 --> 00:18:02,092
No! No. No!

111
00:18:02,092 --> 00:18:04,135
No! No! No!

112
00:18:11,344 --> 00:18:12,308
Okay.

113
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,253
Did it touch you? Huh?

114
00:18:24,352 --> 00:18:26,315
- Uh-uh.
- Did it touch you, Nolan?

115
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:27,752
I don't think so.

116
00:18:34,195 --> 00:18:35,463
Hold on to the rope.

117
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:41,900
What do you see?
Momma, what is it?

118
00:18:47,438 --> 00:18:49,646
Breathe. Just breathe.

119
00:18:56,444 --> 00:18:58,816
Breathe. Breathe.

120
00:18:58,816 --> 00:19:02,184
It's okay. It's okay.
Just breathe. Just breathe.

121
00:19:03,692 --> 00:19:04,690
Just breathe.

122
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:12,262
On your knees.

123
00:19:12,262 --> 00:19:13,336
I need to be sure.

124
00:19:15,872 --> 00:19:17,035
Don't look at me.

125
00:19:17,035 --> 00:19:18,532
Touch the wood!

126
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:19,837
Hands on the cellar.

127
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:21,344
Say it.

128
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,044
Say it!

129
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:34,154
O blessed house
of ancient wood.

130
00:19:34,154 --> 00:19:36,785
Shelter to the pure and good.

131
00:19:36,785 --> 00:19:39,728
We'll keep you bright
and never roam.

132
00:19:39,728 --> 00:19:41,488
Heaven is here,

133
00:19:41,488 --> 00:19:42,992
within our home.

134
00:19:50,434 --> 00:19:51,407
Okay, get up.

135
00:19:55,345 --> 00:19:57,539
- What happened?
-I didn't mean to.

136
00:19:57,539 --> 00:19:58,716
I stepped on his rope...

137
00:19:58,716 --> 00:20:01,051
Have you lost your mind?

138
00:20:01,051 --> 00:20:02,484
It's all right, Momma.
He didn't...

139
00:20:02,484 --> 00:20:06,480
Quiet! One more second
and it woulda all been over.

140
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,089
For all of us!

141
00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:10,821
That rope is your lifeline.

142
00:20:10,821 --> 00:20:12,995
-I'm sorry.
- I don't need you to be sorry!

143
00:20:12,995 --> 00:20:14,628
I need you to use your head!

144
00:20:28,648 --> 00:20:29,610
Can you move it?

145
00:20:31,748 --> 00:20:32,976
I think it's broke.

146
00:20:43,626 --> 00:20:46,660
Don't just stand there.
Get me a splint for his ankle.

147
00:20:50,563 --> 00:20:53,227
I know. I know, I know.

148
00:20:55,808 --> 00:20:57,099
Come on. It's okay.

149
00:21:02,475 --> 00:21:04,612
What'd it look like this time?

150
00:21:10,514 --> 00:21:11,487
Like my momma.

151
00:21:15,421 --> 00:21:16,756
It's trying to scare me.

152
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,299
<i>Like it tried to scare
my momma before.</i>

153
00:22:16,218 --> 00:22:17,751
That's all we got today.

154
00:22:20,024 --> 00:22:21,359
Don't eat too fast.

155
00:22:23,895 --> 00:22:25,055
Sure is good.

156
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:44,809
I used to be thankful

157
00:22:44,809 --> 00:22:47,275
that the Evil
didn't show itself to you.

158
00:22:51,114 --> 00:22:54,458
And then, I figured out
what it was doing.

159
00:22:58,557 --> 00:23:00,189
I never told y'all this.

160
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,191
But one time,

161
00:23:03,233 --> 00:23:05,293
it came to me as a little girl,

162
00:23:06,367 --> 00:23:07,735
crying out for help.

163
00:23:09,932 --> 00:23:13,037
She was just at my rope's limit.

164
00:23:15,281 --> 00:23:18,306
She got her foot stuck
in a gopher hole.

165
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,347
She was howling, screaming.

166
00:23:25,748 --> 00:23:27,216
I saw the bone

167
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:30,955
sticking out.

168
00:23:30,955 --> 00:23:34,263
I had to keep telling myself
that it wasn't real.

169
00:23:34,263 --> 00:23:36,995
But the screams
went on for days.

170
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:39,602
So, every morning,

171
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:41,901
I went out to check...

172
00:23:43,966 --> 00:23:45,509
to see if the Evil had given up.

173
00:23:48,475 --> 00:23:50,872
But she was still there.

174
00:23:50,872 --> 00:23:53,946
Her skin turned blue and gray.

175
00:23:57,317 --> 00:23:58,280
The smell...

176
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:03,494
I wondered
why she was still out there.

177
00:24:04,356 --> 00:24:06,430
Why?

178
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:09,027
Because it wanted me
to go see about that girl.

179
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:12,470
It wanted me to doubt myself.

180
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,506
To lure me off the rope.

181
00:24:16,437 --> 00:24:17,970
The Evil is clever...

182
00:24:19,636 --> 00:24:22,171
and patient.

183
00:24:22,171 --> 00:24:25,478
It's like the snake
you've seen in the woods.

184
00:24:25,478 --> 00:24:29,179
Evil can wear many, many skins.

185
00:24:31,618 --> 00:24:33,821
And the greatest trick of all,

186
00:24:34,621 --> 00:24:36,384
it's playing on you boys.

187
00:24:37,294 --> 00:24:39,692
And when enough time goes by,

188
00:24:39,692 --> 00:24:41,829
you're gonna forget
it's even there.

189
00:24:42,961 --> 00:24:44,865
You're gonna
let your guard down.

190
00:24:45,664 --> 00:24:46,968
And it's gonna get you!

191
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,367
One touch

192
00:24:53,704 --> 00:24:55,370
without a rope on

193
00:24:56,982 --> 00:24:58,542
is all it takes

194
00:24:58,542 --> 00:25:00,875
to possess one of us

195
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:02,751
and get inside the house.

196
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:04,852
Never

197
00:25:06,055 --> 00:25:07,316
let go.

198
00:25:09,687 --> 00:25:11,023
Never let go.

199
00:25:36,548 --> 00:25:37,511
How long?

200
00:25:38,717 --> 00:25:39,887
About an hour.

201
00:25:40,851 --> 00:25:42,586
Felt longer tonight.

202
00:25:42,586 --> 00:25:43,924
Did you imagine it?

203
00:25:48,592 --> 00:25:49,567
Yes.

204
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,671
Tell us about it.

205
00:25:54,671 --> 00:25:57,697
I imagined it was all gone.

206
00:25:57,697 --> 00:25:58,708
You.

207
00:26:00,439 --> 00:26:01,403
Sam.

208
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:03,746
Koda.

209
00:26:05,247 --> 00:26:06,210
The house.

210
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,984
All I had left was the darkness.

211
00:26:11,782 --> 00:26:12,953
And then what?

212
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,020
I thought about our birth
in the house,

213
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,956
and how safe
it keeps us every day.

214
00:26:19,956 --> 00:26:21,731
And I felt
the darkness float away.

215
00:26:22,935 --> 00:26:24,129
Look around.

216
00:26:25,896 --> 00:26:27,863
Look how lucky you are.

217
00:26:27,863 --> 00:26:30,801
All your dreams came true.

218
00:26:30,801 --> 00:26:32,676
The Evil can't touch you here.

219
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:36,773
Samuel, your turn.

220
00:26:36,773 --> 00:26:38,440
Time to clean your soul.

221
00:26:43,953 --> 00:26:48,084
Remember, lose us completely
and then find us again.

222
00:26:48,084 --> 00:26:50,991
Fill the cellar up
with all your love.

223
00:26:50,991 --> 00:26:54,291
You remind the house
why we deserve its protection.

224
00:27:05,969 --> 00:27:07,172
Can I move yet?

225
00:27:07,771 --> 00:27:09,169
Nope.

226
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,072
Nolan, I got an itch.

227
00:27:11,072 --> 00:27:13,250
I said, "Don't move."

228
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,476
It's just one itch.

229
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:17,820
Okay.

230
00:27:19,883 --> 00:27:20,889
That should do it.

231
00:27:25,624 --> 00:27:26,554
Wow.

232
00:27:27,496 --> 00:27:29,031
Are those owl wings?

233
00:27:29,031 --> 00:27:30,030
Uh-huh.

234
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,126
I can fly anywhere I want.

235
00:27:33,126 --> 00:27:34,837
And eat whatever you want.

236
00:27:36,207 --> 00:27:37,769
Once upon a time,

237
00:27:37,769 --> 00:27:39,840
there was a boy who could fly

238
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,075
and catch all the squirrels
in the trees.

239
00:28:01,033 --> 00:28:01,996
Hey, Sam.

240
00:28:03,367 --> 00:28:04,768
After your rope broke,

241
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,836
did you notice anything?

242
00:28:08,502 --> 00:28:09,667
Like what?

243
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:11,398
Anything strange.

244
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,568
That was the first time
we ever let go.

245
00:28:15,709 --> 00:28:17,379
And nothing changed.

246
00:28:17,379 --> 00:28:18,672
'Cause it didn't get us.

247
00:28:20,216 --> 00:28:21,180
Yeah.

248
00:28:28,116 --> 00:28:30,153
If it did,

249
00:28:30,153 --> 00:28:32,389
do you think
Momma woulda killed us?

250
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:35,898
Like she killed Poppa?

251
00:28:39,065 --> 00:28:41,370
Like she killed
Grandma and Grandpa?

252
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:42,905
The Evil touched them.

253
00:28:43,968 --> 00:28:45,402
She was protecting us.

254
00:28:46,034 --> 00:28:46,975
I know that.

255
00:28:53,711 --> 00:28:54,908
What?

256
00:28:54,908 --> 00:28:55,918
Nothing.

257
00:29:00,957 --> 00:29:02,851
You ever wish
you could run free like Koda?

258
00:29:03,922 --> 00:29:05,228
Without a rope
around your chest?

259
00:29:05,228 --> 00:29:07,091
But Koda's a dog.

260
00:29:07,091 --> 00:29:09,228
The Evil doesn't care
about animals.

261
00:29:26,751 --> 00:29:28,918
You ever wish you could see
what she sees?

262
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:30,854
Just once?

263
00:29:33,658 --> 00:29:36,354
I felt something
getting closer today.

264
00:29:37,186 --> 00:29:38,521
You were just scared.

265
00:29:41,524 --> 00:29:43,262
Why are you asking
all these questions?

266
00:29:44,501 --> 00:29:46,298
Momma never lied to us.

267
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:58,112
"She loves me more."

268
00:30:00,711 --> 00:30:03,649
That's what I heard you say
before I stepped on your rope.

269
00:30:03,649 --> 00:30:04,778
I didn't say that.

270
00:30:10,957 --> 00:30:12,390
I didn't mean for what happened.

271
00:30:14,561 --> 00:30:15,723
I know.

272
00:31:06,746 --> 00:31:08,215
O blessed house...

273
00:31:11,752 --> 00:31:13,055
of ancient wood.

274
00:31:14,687 --> 00:31:15,618
Home...

275
00:31:16,956 --> 00:31:18,423
to my runaway wife.

276
00:31:27,966 --> 00:31:29,302
Hey, Junebug.

277
00:31:33,444 --> 00:31:34,406
What's wrong?

278
00:31:37,215 --> 00:31:38,146
June!

279
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,544
June!

280
00:31:43,553 --> 00:31:44,614
June, it's me.

281
00:31:50,395 --> 00:31:51,456
It's been a while.

282
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,064
God, have I missed you.

283
00:31:57,161 --> 00:31:58,430
You think I can see 'em?

284
00:32:03,734 --> 00:32:06,009
Oh, you ain't told 'em
the truth about their father.

285
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:08,638
I get it.

286
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:12,411
'Cause then you got to
tell 'em who you really are.

287
00:32:13,675 --> 00:32:15,946
Ain't that right,
my little Junebug?

288
00:32:15,946 --> 00:32:17,350
I'm not her no more.

289
00:32:18,248 --> 00:32:19,484
You know you loved it.

290
00:32:21,921 --> 00:32:22,960
What's your plan?

291
00:32:23,823 --> 00:32:25,462
I know ya.

292
00:32:25,462 --> 00:32:26,689
You ain't got no plan.

293
00:32:27,766 --> 00:32:29,799
You might as well
give 'em to me.

294
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:31,661
Or would you rather
watch them starve?

295
00:32:38,301 --> 00:32:40,175
I came so close today.

296
00:32:46,649 --> 00:32:47,611
Sooner or later,

297
00:32:49,048 --> 00:32:50,218
you're gonna let go.

298
00:32:51,555 --> 00:32:52,715
And when you do...

299
00:32:58,129 --> 00:33:00,525
I'm gonna
make you eat your babies.

300
00:33:02,465 --> 00:33:03,396
June!

301
00:33:04,192 --> 00:33:05,167
June!

302
00:33:13,339 --> 00:33:15,408
Careful now.
Don't break those roots.

303
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,250
You think it'll get better?

304
00:33:23,082 --> 00:33:24,885
Hard to say.

305
00:33:24,885 --> 00:33:27,117
The winter did a number on us.

306
00:33:27,117 --> 00:33:29,092
All we can do now is hope.

307
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,228
What?

308
00:33:33,661 --> 00:33:34,592
Nothing.

309
00:33:40,704 --> 00:33:43,171
The snake on your back.

310
00:33:43,171 --> 00:33:46,537
You said you got it
when you were in the city.

311
00:33:46,537 --> 00:33:49,237
But you also said
the Evil was already there,

312
00:33:49,237 --> 00:33:50,542
killing everybody.

313
00:33:51,506 --> 00:33:52,539
I don't understand...

314
00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:54,051
I got it before it all started.

315
00:33:55,851 --> 00:33:57,186
When I met your Poppa.

316
00:33:58,384 --> 00:34:00,420
I was a different person
back then.

317
00:34:01,285 --> 00:34:02,257
Does it still scare you?

318
00:34:03,593 --> 00:34:05,252
Not anymore.

319
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:06,261
I like it now.

320
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:09,526
Why?

321
00:34:09,526 --> 00:34:11,398
Because
it's from your life before.

322
00:34:12,603 --> 00:34:14,729
In the old world.

323
00:34:14,729 --> 00:34:16,964
A world
full of pain and suffering?

324
00:34:17,907 --> 00:34:19,406
What's to like about that?

325
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,641
Huh?

326
00:34:24,482 --> 00:34:25,445
Don't know.

327
00:34:26,211 --> 00:34:27,645
When I was your age,

328
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:30,978
asking questions like you do,

329
00:34:32,452 --> 00:34:34,223
I didn't really believe
my momma, either.

330
00:34:35,255 --> 00:34:37,751
- That's why you left?
- Mm-hmm.

331
00:34:37,751 --> 00:34:39,558
Never thought
I'd come back here.

332
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:44,426
But it's the only place
I could keep y'all safe.

333
00:34:44,426 --> 00:34:46,397
But what if the Evil did...

334
00:34:46,397 --> 00:34:47,896
touch one of us
and come in the house?

335
00:34:48,804 --> 00:34:49,997
What would happen?

336
00:34:51,942 --> 00:34:54,535
It would make us
kill each other.

337
00:34:54,535 --> 00:34:56,069
That's how the world ended.

338
00:35:02,248 --> 00:35:04,583
But how do you know we're alone?

339
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:07,482
Maybe our house isn't
the only one that's protected.

340
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:09,752
Would that make you feel better?

341
00:35:09,752 --> 00:35:11,628
We wouldn't be alone
for the rest of our lives.

342
00:35:11,628 --> 00:35:13,728
We're not alone, Nolan.

343
00:35:13,728 --> 00:35:15,132
We have each other.

344
00:35:15,832 --> 00:35:17,134
And that's everything.

345
00:35:19,036 --> 00:35:21,303
There's nobody else
out there, baby.

346
00:35:23,433 --> 00:35:24,834
We're the world now.

347
00:35:41,693 --> 00:35:43,188
<i>"Once upon a time,</i>

348
00:35:43,188 --> 00:35:45,122

00:36:52,196 --> 00:36:54,858
<i>"'And we shall be freed
from them.'"</i>

371
00:37:11,474 --> 00:37:12,605
It's new.

372
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,113
You sure?

373
00:37:14,113 --> 00:37:15,483
You got eyes, don't you?

374
00:37:16,248 --> 00:37:17,686
It's a new moon.

375
00:37:17,686 --> 00:37:18,651
Right, Momma?

376
00:37:19,748 --> 00:37:21,214

Nolan?

406
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:39,792
Nolan.

407
00:39:49,105 --> 00:39:50,473
Are you still asleep?

408
00:39:52,138 --> 00:39:53,435
Nolan.

409
00:39:53,435 --> 00:39:54,741
There you go.

410
00:39:56,544 --> 00:39:58,580
You forgot
your bell again.

411
00:43:29,293 --> 00:43:31,089
It's better with sap.

412
00:43:33,293 --> 00:43:34,387
Yeah.

413
00:43:34,387 --> 00:43:36,490
That'll make it taste
less like a tree.

414
00:43:44,102 --> 00:43:46,269
<i>We're doing
the best we can.</i>

415
00:43:47,175 --> 00:43:48,139
Eat.

416
00:44:26,841 --> 00:44:28,147
Momma?

417
00:44:28,147 --> 00:44:29,147
Sam?

418
00:44:42,458 --> 00:44:46,165
No!

419
00:44:46,165 --> 00:44:47,165
No!

420
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:49,596
No! No!

421
00:45:23,898 --> 00:45:24,906
Koda.

422
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:36,018
Touch the wood.

423
00:45:36,018 --> 00:45:37,276
Say it!

424
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:39,380
O blessed house of ancient wood.

425
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:42,184
Shelter
to the pure and good.

426
00:45:42,184 --> 00:45:44,756
We'll keep you bright
and never roam.

427
00:45:44,756 --> 00:45:47,020
Heaven is here, within our home.

428
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:48,089
Say it again.

429
00:45:48,089 --> 00:45:50,231
O blessed house of ancient wood.

430
00:45:50,231 --> 00:45:51,465
Again!

431
00:45:51,465 --> 00:45:52,568
O blessed house

432
00:45:52,568 --> 00:45:53,767
- of ancient wood...
-Louder!

433
00:45:53,767 --> 00:45:55,805
Shelter to the pure
and good!

434
00:45:59,934 --> 00:46:01,107
Momma.

435
00:46:07,249 --> 00:46:08,477
Momma!

436
00:46:11,289 --> 00:46:13,317
I have to pee, Momma!

437
00:46:13,948 --> 00:46:15,121
Momma!

438
00:46:31,433 --> 00:46:33,700
Did you feel
the darkness go away?

439
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:58,494
Sam.

440
00:47:00,161 --> 00:47:01,167
You're awake?

441
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,138
No.

442
00:47:04,138 --> 00:47:05,402
Sam.

443
00:47:06,704 --> 00:47:07,800
Sam!

444
00:47:09,003 --> 00:47:10,011
Yes.

445
00:47:11,482 --> 00:47:12,882
We need to leave the house.

446
00:47:13,515 --> 00:47:14,675
Goodnight, Nolan.

447
00:47:15,516 --> 00:47:17,352
I'm serious.

448
00:47:17,352 --> 00:47:18,921
- Sam!
- Shh.

449
00:47:24,527 --> 00:47:27,028
How do you wanna leave?

450
00:47:27,028 --> 00:47:29,859
The Evil will catch us as soon
as we take off the rope.

451
00:47:29,859 --> 00:47:30,961
We know the forest.

452
00:47:30,961 --> 00:47:32,492
If we look after each other,

453
00:47:32,492 --> 00:47:34,068
we might have
a chance to outrun it.

454
00:47:34,833 --> 00:47:36,499
What about Momma?

455
00:47:36,499 --> 00:47:38,732
We'll come back for her
once we find something to eat.

456
00:47:40,038 --> 00:47:41,741
Momma knows what's right for us.

457
00:47:41,741 --> 00:47:43,605
I don't think she does anymore.

458
00:47:44,942 --> 00:47:46,315
Did you see her?

459
00:47:46,315 --> 00:47:47,917
She's starving, too.

460
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:50,920
She always
figures something out.

461
00:47:52,216 --> 00:47:53,956
For once,
we have to help.

462
00:47:55,416 --> 00:47:57,583
By disobeying her?

463
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,522
Will you really
let go of the rope?

464
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:08,102
I can let go of the rope,

465
00:48:09,399 --> 00:48:11,468
but I can't let go
of my brother.

466
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:25,218
It's too dangerous.

467
00:48:27,148 --> 00:48:28,551
I'm sorry.

468
00:49:52,742 --> 00:49:54,868
This is a very special tool.

469
00:49:56,547 --> 00:49:57,574
It's called a camera.

470
00:50:00,979 --> 00:50:02,650
What does it do?

471
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:03,844
Takes pictures.

472
00:50:06,717 --> 00:50:10,488
It captures what it sees,
with this little eye.

473
00:50:13,155 --> 00:50:15,128
You aim it,

474
00:50:15,128 --> 00:50:18,223
then you push this button
right here and...

475
00:50:20,561 --> 00:50:22,566
A real-life picture comes out.

476
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:29,408
Like this one.

477
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:31,608
This was me...

478
00:50:33,078 --> 00:50:34,380
from the old world.

479
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,014
Is that really you?

480
00:50:38,014 --> 00:50:39,418
Hey, hey, careful.

481
00:50:43,388 --> 00:50:45,523
I was a different person
back then.

482
00:50:53,063 --> 00:50:54,070
Or this one.

483
00:50:59,468 --> 00:51:01,308
I took it outside on the porch.

484
00:51:03,413 --> 00:51:04,740
Sam.

485
00:51:08,884 --> 00:51:11,080
- This is us?
-Mm-hmm.

486
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,578
And this is Koda.

487
00:51:12,578 --> 00:51:14,585
Yep.

488
00:51:15,917 --> 00:51:18,527
You can take a picture
of anything you want.

489
00:51:18,527 --> 00:51:20,292
But a good picture

490
00:51:20,292 --> 00:51:22,725
shows more than
what the camera's looking at.

491
00:51:24,592 --> 00:51:26,930
It shows a special moment,

492
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:28,737
frozen in time.

493
00:51:28,737 --> 00:51:30,667
They can even show a feeling.

494
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:33,175
Like love.

495
00:51:39,748 --> 00:51:40,743
Where's Poppa?

496
00:51:42,577 --> 00:51:44,643
He was holding the camera.

497
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,287
Do you have a picture of him?

498
00:51:47,149 --> 00:51:49,056
Mm-mm.

499
00:51:49,056 --> 00:51:51,017
These are the only two
I chose to keep.

500
00:51:53,656 --> 00:51:55,894
And there's one more
in there, too.

501
00:51:55,894 --> 00:51:56,858
I've been saving it.

502
00:51:57,534 --> 00:51:58,497
For when?

503
00:52:01,431 --> 00:52:02,699
Look for the right moment.

504
00:52:03,531 --> 00:52:05,468
Maybe you'll find one

505
00:52:05,468 --> 00:52:07,776
that reminds us
what we're living for.

506
00:52:07,776 --> 00:52:09,772
Even if it's something small.

507
00:52:10,982 --> 00:52:13,149
'Cause some moments in life
are hard.

508
00:52:14,645 --> 00:52:18,011
But when we remember
why we're holding on,

509
00:52:18,821 --> 00:52:20,288
we get strong again.

510
00:52:28,962 --> 00:52:30,166
This right here

511
00:52:31,464 --> 00:52:33,796
is about to be
one of those hard moments.

512
00:52:40,305 --> 00:52:42,338
We've been through some brutal,

513
00:52:42,338 --> 00:52:44,438
brutal winters, haven't we?

514
00:52:44,438 --> 00:52:45,874
But nothing like this one.

515
00:52:46,817 --> 00:52:48,010
Everything in the garden,

516
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:49,141
gone.

517
00:52:50,579 --> 00:52:52,353
The roots are waterlogged.

518
00:52:55,092 --> 00:52:57,083
The animals,
they ain't come back yet.

519
00:52:58,563 --> 00:52:59,657
We got water.

520
00:53:00,424 --> 00:53:02,198
But that'll last us maybe

521
00:53:02,897 --> 00:53:04,291
a couple weeks.

522
00:53:04,291 --> 00:53:05,498
Maybe a month.

523
00:53:10,068 --> 00:53:11,163
But soon...

524
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:15,937
our bodies

525
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:18,874
are gonna start shutting down.

526
00:53:23,281 --> 00:53:24,583
And we're gonna die.

527
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:35,726
So, we only got one option.

528
00:53:40,297 --> 00:53:41,369
And that's Koda.

529
00:53:42,363 --> 00:53:43,498
What?

530
00:53:43,498 --> 00:53:45,370
We can salt the meat.

531
00:53:45,370 --> 00:53:47,040
Maybe it'll last us
a month or so

532
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,036
- before it's spoiled.
- No!

533
00:53:51,474 --> 00:53:52,613
I know you love him.

534
00:53:52,613 --> 00:53:53,774
We all do.

535
00:53:53,774 --> 00:53:55,712
But he nearing
the end of his life,

536
00:53:55,712 --> 00:53:58,347
and he... he ain't caught us
nothing in months.

537
00:53:58,347 --> 00:53:59,679
We can eat more frogs.

538
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:01,450
That's not gonna be enough.

539
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:02,550
I'll eat the bark, the bugs.

540
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:03,750
I don't mind it, Momma. I swear.

541
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:05,059
- Nolan.
- Maybe it's safe to leave.

542
00:54:05,059 --> 00:54:06,689
I was out there
without a rope on.

543
00:54:06,689 --> 00:54:08,259
The Evil coulda touched me,
but it didn't.

544
00:54:08,259 --> 00:54:09,922
'Cause it chose not to.

545
00:54:09,922 --> 00:54:11,927
It wants you to doubt me.
And look...

546
00:54:13,136 --> 00:54:14,700
that's exactly
what you're doing.

547
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,903
What if you're wrong? What if
the world is still out there?

548
00:54:16,903 --> 00:54:18,532
This is the world!

549
00:54:18,532 --> 00:54:20,307
There's nothing out there!

550
00:54:20,307 --> 00:54:23,041
It's either the house
or the Evil. That's it!

551
00:54:23,041 --> 00:54:24,571
No. This is evil.

552
00:54:24,571 --> 00:54:26,811
Eating family is evil!

553
00:54:26,811 --> 00:54:29,574
If we can't feed ourselves,
how are we gonna feed the dog?

554
00:54:29,574 --> 00:54:30,979
You wanna die?

555
00:54:30,979 --> 00:54:33,921
I don't wanna die, but I don't
wanna see my friend die!

556
00:54:33,921 --> 00:54:35,583
But this is not fair!

557
00:54:35,583 --> 00:54:37,821
All he's done is protect us!

558
00:54:40,797 --> 00:54:41,825
Let's ask Samuel.

559
00:54:43,758 --> 00:54:44,998
Of course he'll do what you say.

560
00:54:44,998 --> 00:54:47,028
He can talk for hisself.

561
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:50,504
Samuel?

562
00:54:56,339 --> 00:54:57,770
We have to.

563
00:54:57,770 --> 00:54:59,741
I hate you! I hate both of you.

564
00:54:59,741 --> 00:55:02,109
I hate this house!
I hate this house!

565
00:55:03,449 --> 00:55:04,881
Come on, Koda.

566
00:55:12,556 --> 00:55:15,287
Momma, I can do it if you want.

567
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:21,032
No.

568
00:55:33,717 --> 00:55:34,680
No.

569
00:55:37,019 --> 00:55:38,444
No!

570
00:55:38,444 --> 00:55:40,150
No. No!

571
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:43,048
No! No! No!

572
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:45,627
Koda! Koda!

573
00:55:45,627 --> 00:55:46,824
No!

574
00:55:47,589 --> 00:55:49,797
No! Momma, please!

575
00:55:49,797 --> 00:55:51,325
Please, no!

576
00:55:51,325 --> 00:55:52,566
Koda!

577
00:55:54,528 --> 00:55:55,668
Koda!

578
00:55:56,365 --> 00:55:57,373
Please!

579
00:56:14,123 --> 00:56:15,457
You're a good dog.

580
00:56:16,221 --> 00:56:17,589
I thank you

581
00:56:17,589 --> 00:56:20,220
for taking good care of us.

582
00:56:35,036 --> 00:56:37,446
You're a good dog.

583
00:57:27,296 --> 00:57:28,860
Momma.

584
00:57:31,495 --> 00:57:32,625
Nolan.

585
00:57:32,625 --> 00:57:33,634
It's not real.

586
00:57:36,302 --> 00:57:37,264
Listen to me.

587
00:57:40,944 --> 00:57:42,740
You need to see.

588
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:45,613
You need to see there's
nothing to be scared of!

589
00:57:45,613 --> 00:57:47,739
That's what it wants you
to think, baby. Don't do it!

590
00:57:47,739 --> 00:57:49,311
No! Don't do it.

591
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:51,118
No. No.

592
00:57:51,118 --> 00:57:53,318
Nolan! Open this door.

593
00:57:53,318 --> 00:57:54,314
Nolan!

594
00:57:56,322 --> 00:57:57,586
Open the door.

595
00:57:57,586 --> 00:57:59,187
Nolan!

596
00:58:01,361 --> 00:58:04,291
Nolan, I... I lied.

597
00:58:04,291 --> 00:58:07,430
I didn't tell you everything.
I brought the Evil here.

598
00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:09,196
The Evil is real!

599
00:58:09,196 --> 00:58:11,931
And if it touches me
and gets inside the house,

600
00:58:11,931 --> 00:58:14,098
it's gonna make me kill you!

601
00:58:14,098 --> 00:58:15,467
Open the door.

602
00:58:16,241 --> 00:58:17,304
Please!

603
00:58:18,147 --> 00:58:19,977
Open the fucking door!

604
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:25,686
Nolan!

605
00:58:26,385 --> 00:58:27,347
Momma!

606
00:58:38,533 --> 00:58:40,327
Bad little goat.

607
00:58:43,498 --> 00:58:45,638
Bad little goat.

608
00:58:45,638 --> 00:58:49,473
Bad little goat,
caught sitting in my chair.

609
00:58:51,541 --> 00:58:53,173
Let's see that tushy,

610
00:58:53,173 --> 00:58:56,081
and I'll make it
so you can't sit anywhere.

611
00:58:56,081 --> 00:58:57,383
It's here!

612
00:58:57,383 --> 00:58:58,884
It's here!

613
00:58:59,616 --> 00:59:01,222
Momma!

614
00:59:03,323 --> 00:59:04,651
Damn it. What the hell?

615
00:59:06,722 --> 00:59:08,025
Bad!

616
00:59:08,458 --> 00:59:11,730
Bad!

617
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:16,572
Bad little goat,
putting poison in my food.

618
00:59:17,205 --> 00:59:19,201
Bad little goat.

619
00:59:19,810 --> 00:59:21,533
Bad!

620
00:59:22,869 --> 00:59:24,202
I told you,

621
00:59:24,202 --> 00:59:27,374
I'm gonna make you
eat your babies.

622
00:59:29,977 --> 00:59:31,719
You'll never get in.

623
00:59:33,483 --> 00:59:34,656
No!

624
00:59:53,505 --> 00:59:54,467
Momma!

625
00:59:59,916 --> 01:00:00,847
Momma?

626
01:00:02,316 --> 01:00:03,809
Wake up, Momma.

627
01:00:03,809 --> 01:00:05,115
Momma, wake up!

628
01:00:11,794 --> 01:00:13,926
It's okay, Momma.
I'm tying the ropes together.

629
01:00:16,794 --> 01:00:18,029
It's okay, Momma. It's okay.

630
01:00:18,695 --> 01:00:19,866
Momma, please.

631
01:00:24,365 --> 01:00:26,769
O blessed house
of ancient wood.

632
01:00:26,769 --> 01:00:29,510
Shelter to the pure and good.

633
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:33,105
We'll keep you bright
and never roam.

634
01:00:33,105 --> 01:00:35,508
Heaven is here, within our home.

635
01:00:38,118 --> 01:00:40,486
Momma, please.

636
01:00:40,486 --> 01:00:42,457
The house has us now, Momma.

637
01:00:42,457 --> 01:00:45,320
You can wake up.
Please, Momma, wake up.

638
01:00:46,361 --> 01:00:47,589
I need you.

639
01:00:47,589 --> 01:00:49,293
Please, Momma.

640
01:00:53,268 --> 01:00:55,765
O blessed house of ancient wood.

641
01:00:55,765 --> 01:00:58,539
Shelter to the pure and good.

642
01:00:58,539 --> 01:01:01,441
We'll keep you bright
and never roam.

643
01:01:01,441 --> 01:01:03,371
Heaven is here, within our home.

644
01:01:04,741 --> 01:01:06,715
Momma, please.

645
01:01:09,185 --> 01:01:10,543
Please, Momma.

Koda!

01:02:52,179 --> 01:02:53,580
Koda!

658
01:02:54,354 --> 01:02:55,654
Koda!

659
01:02:55,654 --> 01:02:57,452
Come back!

660
01:02:57,984 --> 01:02:59,558
Koda!

661
01:03:45,706 --> 01:03:48,267
I made some pine needle tea.

662
01:03:48,267 --> 01:03:49,801
It'll help with your hunger.

663
01:03:52,646 --> 01:03:54,179
Was that you out there?

664
01:03:57,386 --> 01:03:58,513
Out where?

665
01:04:00,982 --> 01:04:02,220
I saw you,

666
01:04:03,425 --> 01:04:05,683
in the woods,

667
01:04:05,683 --> 01:04:08,721
laughing at me for not
being able to save her.

668
01:04:12,097 --> 01:04:13,759
I think
you were dreaming.

669
01:04:17,571 --> 01:04:18,874
Touch the wood.

670
01:04:22,707 --> 01:04:23,670
Touch it.

671
01:04:30,718 --> 01:04:34,016
O blessed house of ancient wood.

672
01:04:34,016 --> 01:04:36,922
Shelter to the pure and good.

673
01:04:36,922 --> 01:04:40,253
We'll keep you bright
and never roam.

674
01:04:40,253 --> 01:04:42,854
Heaven is here, within our home.

675
01:04:51,207 --> 01:04:52,138
Okay.

676
01:04:52,737 --> 01:04:53,700
Now drink.

677
01:04:56,940 --> 01:04:58,144
You need some air.

678
01:05:06,621 --> 01:05:08,385
I won't let you die.

679
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:03,104
Help!

680
01:07:04,505 --> 01:07:05,931
Help!

681
01:07:08,707 --> 01:07:10,045
Hello!

682
01:07:22,215 --> 01:07:23,784
Help!

683
01:07:40,476 --> 01:07:41,703
Excuse me!

684
01:07:43,105 --> 01:07:44,277
Hi, there.

685
01:07:45,275 --> 01:07:47,247
Sorry to intrude. I just, uh...

686
01:07:48,046 --> 01:07:50,282
I was hiking, and I...

687
01:07:50,282 --> 01:07:52,546
I thought I heard someone
screaming for help.

688
01:07:52,546 --> 01:07:54,551
That wasn't you,
by any chance, was it?

689
01:07:55,987 --> 01:07:57,222
I...

690
01:07:57,222 --> 01:07:59,591
I thought my ears
were playing tricks on me.

691
01:08:02,493 --> 01:08:04,355
Wow, I didn't think
anyone was out here.

692
01:08:04,355 --> 01:08:05,595
This is, uh...

693
01:08:07,832 --> 01:08:08,796
Ah.

694
01:08:15,138 --> 01:08:16,111
Are you okay?

695
01:08:20,947 --> 01:08:22,480
What's your name, son?

696
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:25,450
Nolan.

697
01:08:28,085 --> 01:08:29,355
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.

698
01:08:30,186 --> 01:08:31,654
- Nolan.
- Nolan.

699
01:08:33,025 --> 01:08:34,492
Hi, Nolan. I'm Cole.

700
01:08:35,929 --> 01:08:37,088
It's nice to meet you.

701
01:08:38,127 --> 01:08:39,090
So, uh...

702
01:08:41,102 --> 01:08:43,303
Where your folks at?
They around?

703
01:08:45,432 --> 01:08:47,137
My momma's dead.

704
01:08:47,137 --> 01:08:49,034
Oh, I'm very sorry to hear that.

705
01:08:51,372 --> 01:08:52,708
How did she pass?

706
01:08:54,016 --> 01:08:56,341
My brother's sick.
He needs food.

707
01:08:56,341 --> 01:08:57,446
Okay.

708
01:08:57,446 --> 01:08:59,715
Well, I've got some food
in my pack.

709
01:09:01,623 --> 01:09:03,290
You know,

710
01:09:03,290 --> 01:09:05,987
Nolan, I've got a truck
about five miles from here,

711
01:09:05,987 --> 01:09:07,854
- and I could take you
and your brother...
-Get back!

712
01:09:07,854 --> 01:09:10,662
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay. Okay, okay.

713
01:09:10,662 --> 01:09:11,661
Whoa.

714
01:09:12,028 --> 01:09:12,992
Okay.

715
01:09:13,403 --> 01:09:14,463
Uh...

716
01:09:14,463 --> 01:09:17,101
Look, I don't mean
you boys any harm.

717
01:09:17,101 --> 01:09:18,866
Nolan here says you're sick.

718
01:09:19,842 --> 01:09:22,009
- We're not stupid.
- Sam.

719
01:09:22,009 --> 01:09:24,970
I didn't say
you were stupid. I just...

720
01:09:24,970 --> 01:09:27,681
I just thought someone
was in trouble. That's it.

721
01:09:27,681 --> 01:09:28,946
You killed my momma.

722
01:09:28,946 --> 01:09:30,180
No, son. I...

723
01:09:30,180 --> 01:09:32,449
I don't know your momma. Okay?

724
01:09:32,449 --> 01:09:34,484
Look, this was just...
this was a mistake.

725
01:09:34,484 --> 01:09:36,153
I'm sorry. I'm gonna go.
I'm gonna leave now,

726
01:09:36,153 --> 01:09:37,286
- all right?
- Don't move.

727
01:09:37,286 --> 01:09:40,652
I ju... Okay. Just calm down.

728
01:09:40,652 --> 01:09:42,057
What if he's a real person?

729
01:09:42,057 --> 01:09:43,264
We were happy.

730
01:09:45,768 --> 01:09:48,025
Listen to me, okay?

731
01:09:48,025 --> 01:09:50,337
I'm just gonna turn,
I'm just gonna go back.

732
01:09:50,337 --> 01:09:52,466
I'm gonna go back from where
I came from, all right?

733
01:09:52,466 --> 01:09:54,741
- Just...
- I said, "Don't move!"

734
01:09:57,505 --> 01:09:59,740
Look, everything's fine.

735
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:01,172
-Just let him go.
- Everything's okay.

736
01:10:02,179 --> 01:10:03,383
Let him go, Sam.

737
01:10:06,214 --> 01:10:07,178
Please.

738
01:10:08,382 --> 01:10:09,356
It's over.

739
01:10:10,692 --> 01:10:11,622
She's gone.

740
01:10:15,630 --> 01:10:16,792
No!

741
01:10:20,393 --> 01:10:21,566
Sam...

742
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:32,379
Help me!

743
01:10:34,273 --> 01:10:35,943
Help me!

744
01:10:39,282 --> 01:10:40,417
Nolan, don't.

745
01:10:40,417 --> 01:10:42,590
- He said he has food.
- It's a trick.

746
01:10:42,590 --> 01:10:44,125
Help me!

747
01:11:44,682 --> 01:11:45,848
<i>911.
What's your emergency?</i>

748
01:11:49,447 --> 01:11:50,457
<i>Sir?</i>

749
01:11:51,322 --> 01:11:52,789
<i>Sir, can you hear me?</i>

750
01:11:53,863 --> 01:11:55,090
<i>Can you tell me...</i>

751
01:11:59,132 --> 01:12:00,962
<i>Sir...</i>

752
01:12:08,838 --> 01:12:10,741
<i>Sir, tell me where you are.</i>

753
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:31,894
Huh.

754
01:12:50,917 --> 01:12:51,984
Mm.

755
01:13:07,364 --> 01:13:08,535
It's from the man.

756
01:13:10,872 --> 01:13:12,033
He's dead.

757
01:13:14,910 --> 01:13:16,807
That wasn't a man.

758
01:13:18,142 --> 01:13:19,106
Try it.

759
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:21,273
Did you let go?

760
01:13:22,146 --> 01:13:23,110
No.

761
01:13:24,218 --> 01:13:25,749
I touched him with the rope on.

762
01:13:25,749 --> 01:13:28,148
He wouldn't have let me
if he was the Evil, right?

763
01:13:29,387 --> 01:13:31,390
You still won't learn.

764
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:33,791
You're falling for it
all over again!

765
01:13:34,555 --> 01:13:35,826
Just try it.

766
01:13:40,329 --> 01:13:41,936
No.

767
01:13:41,936 --> 01:13:44,531
Maybe there's no Evil.

768
01:13:44,531 --> 01:13:45,935
Momma lied to us.

769
01:13:47,772 --> 01:13:50,642
We're not the only ones left
in the world.

770
01:13:50,642 --> 01:13:52,376
If we thought there was
nothing out there for us,

771
01:13:52,376 --> 01:13:53,807
then we wouldn't
wanna leave her.

772
01:13:53,807 --> 01:13:55,445
She killed herself
to keep us safe,

773
01:13:55,445 --> 01:13:57,114
and you still won't believe it!

774
01:13:57,114 --> 01:13:58,486
Just try it!

775
01:14:00,617 --> 01:14:02,248
You'll see that it's real!

776
01:14:03,323 --> 01:14:05,526
It'll make you feel better!

777
01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:09,662
I promise.

778
01:14:12,462 --> 01:14:13,796
Once upon a time,

779
01:14:13,796 --> 01:14:15,836
there were two brothers
who trusted each other.

780
01:14:15,836 --> 01:14:17,428
She loved you!

781
01:14:18,798 --> 01:14:20,332
She loved you.

782
01:14:21,836 --> 01:14:23,940
And I'm so sorry for what I did.

783
01:14:28,611 --> 01:14:29,979
But we're not safe.

784
01:14:33,119 --> 01:14:35,422
We're dying.

785
01:14:35,422 --> 01:14:37,448
At least then we'll be
with Momma again.

786
01:14:38,889 --> 01:14:41,122
Maybe that'll be enough
for you this time.

787
01:17:03,798 --> 01:17:04,771
Hello?

788
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:09,644
Who's in there?

789
01:17:10,946 --> 01:17:11,877
Koda?

790
01:17:18,052 --> 01:17:19,016
Hello?

791
01:17:37,368 --> 01:17:38,332
Momma?

792
01:17:53,651 --> 01:17:55,316
Hello?

793
01:17:58,854 --> 01:18:00,827
I'm looking for my dad.

794
01:18:02,430 --> 01:18:03,989
He asked me to wait by the car,

795
01:18:03,989 --> 01:18:05,161
but he never came back.

796
01:18:09,503 --> 01:18:11,101
Do you mind lowering that?

797
01:18:16,176 --> 01:18:17,107
Thanks.

798
01:18:18,511 --> 01:18:20,044
How did you get here?

799
01:18:22,078 --> 01:18:24,213
I followed his footsteps
in the mud.

800
01:18:25,788 --> 01:18:29,185
He's tall, black hair,
a bit of gray on the sides?

801
01:18:30,885 --> 01:18:32,089
Have you seen him?

802
01:18:39,766 --> 01:18:41,802
Why is that rope
around your waist?

803
01:18:44,701 --> 01:18:46,136
To keep me safe.

804
01:18:46,966 --> 01:18:48,072
From what?

805
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:56,278
Where did you get
that flashlight?

806
01:18:59,650 --> 01:19:00,887
That's my dad's.

807
01:19:02,257 --> 01:19:03,791
It was a mistake.

808
01:19:05,117 --> 01:19:06,756
I didn't mean to.

809
01:19:06,756 --> 01:19:07,927
What are you talking about?

810
01:19:08,658 --> 01:19:09,797
Where is he?

811
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:15,731
What did you do?

812
01:19:15,731 --> 01:19:17,464
What did you do to him?

813
01:19:18,904 --> 01:19:20,500
I thought
he was the Evil.

814
01:19:22,144 --> 01:19:23,239
No, wait!

815
01:19:27,108 --> 01:19:29,179
I thought he was the Evil!

816
01:19:30,317 --> 01:19:31,978
Come back!

817
01:19:46,927 --> 01:19:47,868
Come back!

818
01:19:54,101 --> 01:19:56,140
The rope... Oh, no.

819
01:20:03,648 --> 01:20:05,251
Please! Come back!

820
01:20:14,395 --> 01:20:15,357
I know she's real.

821
01:22:07,107 --> 01:22:08,107
Aah!

822
01:22:47,613 --> 01:22:48,543
Sam!

823
01:23:00,724 --> 01:23:01,820
Sam!

824
01:23:27,553 --> 01:23:28,748
Sam!

825
01:23:37,391 --> 01:23:38,758
Nolan!

826
01:23:40,368 --> 01:23:41,332
Sam?

827
01:23:42,601 --> 01:23:43,565
Sam!

828
01:23:45,232 --> 01:23:46,271
Nolan!

829
01:23:53,711 --> 01:23:54,675
Sam!

830
01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:00,714
Sam!

831
01:24:02,381 --> 01:24:03,453
Where are you?

832
01:24:15,535 --> 01:24:16,532
No!

833
01:24:56,004 --> 01:24:56,968
Sam?

834
01:25:30,008 --> 01:25:31,970
Huh?

835
01:25:34,683 --> 01:25:35,809
It's not real.

836
01:25:38,015 --> 01:25:38,977
It's not real.

837
01:26:06,382 --> 01:26:07,346
Sam.

838
01:26:18,485 --> 01:26:19,754
Why did you cut my rope?

839
01:26:46,851 --> 01:26:47,782
Sam.

840
01:26:50,085 --> 01:26:51,049
Sam.

841
01:27:07,799 --> 01:27:10,101
O blessed house of ancient wood.

842
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:14,043
Shelter to the pure and good.

843
01:27:15,906 --> 01:27:18,709
We'll keep you bright
and never roam.

844
01:27:18,709 --> 01:27:20,947
Heaven is here, within our home!

845
01:27:32,797 --> 01:27:33,960
Stop it, Sam!

846
01:27:37,639 --> 01:27:40,131
Sam! Sam!

847
01:27:41,576 --> 01:27:42,507
Sam!

848
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:45,675
Sam! Sam!

849
01:27:47,747 --> 01:27:48,678
Sam!

850
01:28:01,761 --> 01:28:03,958

01:30:34,348 --> 01:30:35,911
I missed you so much.

876
01:30:37,776 --> 01:30:38,782
You're not her.

877
01:30:40,418 --> 01:30:42,278
I saw what you did to Sam.

878
01:30:42,278 --> 01:30:44,122
You saw what he really was.

879
01:30:44,122 --> 01:30:45,690
I just helped him see it.

880
01:31:14,746 --> 01:31:16,490
Look at what you did.

881
01:31:18,621 --> 01:31:21,525
You destroyed your whole family.

882
01:31:21,525 --> 01:31:23,354
And I didn't even
have to touch you.

883
01:31:26,330 --> 01:31:27,657
I didn't mean to.

884
01:31:27,657 --> 01:31:29,293
It's okay.

885
01:31:29,293 --> 01:31:31,296
You don't have
to be scared anymore.

886
01:31:35,472 --> 01:31:36,934
You're not my momma!

All you got to do...

894
01:31:56,491 --> 01:31:57,762
is let go.

01:32:01,396 --> 01:32:02,426

Did you imagine it?

912
01:33:07,195 --> 01:33:08,162
Yes.

913
01:33:09,730 --> 01:33:11,867
Tell us about it.

914
01:33:11,867 --> 01:33:14,374
I thought about
our birth in the house,

915
01:33:14,374 --> 01:33:17,134
and how safe
it keeps us every day.

916
01:33:17,134 --> 01:33:19,539
And I felt
the darkness float away.

917
01:33:23,011 --> 01:33:25,647
When we remember
why we're holding on,

918
01:33:25,647 --> 01:33:27,445
and who we holding on for...

919
01:33:33,953 --> 01:33:35,456
...we get strong again.

920
01:33:36,594 --> 01:33:38,792
The Evil
can't touch me here,

921
01:33:38,792 --> 01:33:40,958
dawn to night and year to year.

922
01:33:45,669 --> 01:33:48,970
O blessed house of ancient wood.

923
01:33:48,970 --> 01:33:51,175
<i>Shelter to the pure and good.</i>

924
01:33:51,175 --> 01:33:53,443
Never let go.

925
01:33:53,443 --> 01:33:54,512
We'll keep you bright

926
01:33:54,512 --> 01:33:56,447
and never roam.

927
01:33:56,447 --> 01:33:58,443
Heaven is here, within our home.

928
01:34:10,261 --> 01:34:11,995
I love you, Momma!

929
01:36:10,817 --> 01:36:13,552
My brother.
I need to find my brother.

930
01:36:13,552 --> 01:36:14,819
- You're safe now.
- My brother.

931
01:36:14,819 --> 01:36:16,412
- But we can't leave him.
- You're safe now.

932
01:36:16,412 --> 01:36:17,985
- Just breathe.
- No! Where is he?

933
01:36:17,985 --> 01:36:19,086
- Just breathe now.
- Where is he?

934
01:36:19,086 --> 01:36:21,258
Just breathe. It's okay.
He's right here.

935
01:36:25,958 --> 01:36:27,834
Sam. Sam.

936
01:36:30,129 --> 01:36:31,929
I'm here. Hey, Sam.

937
01:36:31,929 --> 01:36:33,202
I'm here, Sam.

938
01:36:33,834 --> 01:36:34,808
I'm here.

939
01:36:37,673 --> 01:36:38,636
We're free.

940
01:37:07,131 --> 01:37:08,204
We're free.

941
01:37:17,813 --> 01:37:19,182
