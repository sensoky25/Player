1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000


2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000


3
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:22,083
Attention all workers. Attention all workers.

4
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,375
Day shift starting in T-minus 15 minutes.

5
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:28,167
Farmers to report to mess hall immediately.

6
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:32,333
If you are experiencing any symptoms,
such as fever, cough…

7
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,417
vomiting, or difficulty breathing…

8
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:37,000
proceed to the medical bay
for examination.

9
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:43,542
The safety and well-being of our colony
is Weyland-Yutani's top priority.

10
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,083
Attention all workers…

11
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,125
Did you hear about
the claustrophobic astronaut?

12
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:50,708
He needed space.

13
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,583
I'm begging you, you got to stop.

14
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,292
I just spent my full share
on a belt that won't fit.

15
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,000
Huge waist.

16
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,250
See that cornbread.

17
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:04,417
Maybe it's 'cause I'm on this seafood diet.

18
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,792
I see food, I eat it.

19
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,625
That's so bad.

20
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:11,208
You always laughed at that one.

21
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,833
Yeah, when I was 12.

22
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:19,167
I'm sure it's Mr. Finch.

23
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:21,792
We owe him three months today.

24
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,500
He'll call again.

25
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,667
Well, maybe we won't be here when he does.

26
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,667
Andy. Stay close to me.

27
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:44,042
Wake up. Wake up now.

28
00:06:44,792 --> 00:06:47,250
We're all Weyland-Yutani slaves.

29
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:52,708
The company pays us with food and shelter
and takes our lives in exchange.

30
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,083
Don't believe their lies.

31
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,208
They own you!

32
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,542
Andy, Andy. Hey, hey, hey.

33
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,042
Hey, Andy. Come on. Come on.

34
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:04,917
-What did I do?
-It's a scam.

35
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,667
The ball is never under the cup
that you pick.

36
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:07,667
It's a trick.

37
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:10,208
But how am I gonna get the money?

38
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:11,583
Money for what?

39
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,542
To pay for the horse when we get to Yvaga.

40
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,458
You're gonna get a horse?

41
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:20,125
I wanna call it Raindy.

42
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:22,917
Do you get it?

43
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,042
-Raindy.
-No, I like it. Yeah, it's good.

44
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:31,208
Okay, so you just wait over there.

45
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,583
Okay, I might be a minute.

46
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,708
Stay out of trouble, all right?

47
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:38,667
All employees will be seen.

48
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,000
Good luck.

49
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:42,375
Line up in an orderly fashion.

50
00:07:42,542 --> 00:07:43,833
Next.

51
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,792
Full name and occupation, please.

52
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:49,208
Marie Raines Carradine, ma'am. Farming.

53
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:50,583
It's about my travel papers.

54
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:54,250
I met my quota,
and I should be free to go now.

55
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:55,708
Right?

56
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,083
Go where?

57
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,417
Yvaga.

58
00:07:59,042 --> 00:08:02,042
It's an independent system,
but it's fully terraformed.

59
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,125
You can actually see the sun out there.

60
00:08:05,292 --> 00:08:06,667
Where are your parents?

61
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,792
They died three cycles ago.

62
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,000
Lung disease, from the mines.

63
00:08:13,917 --> 00:08:15,458
It's just me and my brother now.

64
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:19,167
They sell us hope to keep us slaves.

65
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:25,542
They sell us hope to keep us slaves.
Wake up now.

66
00:08:36,832 --> 00:08:39,707
I'm sorry, but you're not eligible
for contract release yet.

67
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:42,375
Due to a shortage of workers,
you're being transferred to the mines.

68
00:08:42,542 --> 00:08:43,832
Wait, what?

69
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,500
No, no, no, I reached the required hours.

70
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:47,917
You have to let me go.

71
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,917
Unfortunately, quotas have been raised
to 24,000 hours…

72
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,875
so you'll be released from contract
in another five to six years.

73
00:08:54,042 --> 00:08:56,000
Thank you, and remember
the company is really grateful…

74
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:57,375
for your ongoing service.

75
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,833
-Rain!
-Hey!

76
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,083
Hey, stop!

77
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,292
Get off him! You bastards!

78
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:06,792
I got you, I got you.

79
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,208
Shit, you're bleeding.

80
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,042
Okay.

81
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:15,625
You're okay.

82
00:09:15,792 --> 00:09:17,125
I'm resetting you.

83
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:18,458
I got you.

84
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,250
It's okay.

85
00:09:22,417 --> 00:09:23,833
I shouldn't have left you alone.

86
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:32,875
They sell us hope to keep us slaves.

87
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:35,083
Wake up now. They own you.

88
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:39,208
Hi, Rain.

89
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,042
Look, I'm sorry. I know I've been calling you
all day…

90
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:44,292
but, look, something's come up,
and I think you should know about it.

91
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,000
So, come by the trailers and bring Andy.

92
00:10:17,292 --> 00:10:18,292
Hey.

93
00:10:19,542 --> 00:10:20,417
Oh, for…

94
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,000
Game over, man.

95
00:10:22,542 --> 00:10:25,083
Sup, Rain? Long time no see.

96
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,042
I told you she'd show up.

97
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:29,000
You owe me five bucks.

98
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,333
Andy!

99
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,292
Why'd the blind miner fall down the well?

100
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:37,792
Why?

101
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:40,792
'Cause he couldn't see that well.

102
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,333
Please don't encourage him.

103
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,000
All right, go inside.
I'll be there in a second.

104
00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:53,333
-Kay.
-Rain.

105
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,542
-Hi.
-Hi!

106
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:55,792
Hi.

107
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,500
I missed you.

108
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:00,500
And I know my brother missed you, too.

109
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,083
I'm really glad you came.

110
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,583
I heard about your dad.

111
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,750
I'm really sorry.

112
00:11:12,542 --> 00:11:15,792
Well, between the hailstorms
and the new diseases every cycle…

113
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,500
Yeah, everybody's dying, right?

114
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,333
So, should we show her?

115
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,208
Show me what?

116
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,958
Okay, so, last night, we're loading up
the last Tesotek…

117
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,708
we're about 200 miles above the ground,
and then all of a sudden…

118
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:31,958
The hauler picks up this beacon.

119
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,125
So Navarro tracks it, and it turns out…

120
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:37,208
there's this big Wey-Yu ship
drifting right above our heads.

121
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,250
Drifting?

122
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:40,042
Decommissioned. Abandoned.

123
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,167
Some old relic.
It's probably damaged or obsolete.

124
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,542
Like that guy over there.

125
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:44,708
Bjorn.

126
00:11:46,042 --> 00:11:48,250
Okay, just tell her.

127
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:50,000
Why are we all sitting around here…

128
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:53,500
waiting for travel permits that the company
are never gonna give to us?

129
00:11:54,042 --> 00:11:56,083
'Cause that hauler has enough power in it
to get us to Yvaga.

130
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,042
Because it takes nine years
to get to Yvaga…

131
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,292
and you can't make that trip
without cryo-sleep.

132
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:04,042
Decommissioned ships still carry
tons of functional equipment.

133
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:07,542
And the hyperlink shows
that ship still has a few pods left.

134
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:17,167
You want to break into a Weyland-Yutani ship
and steal highly regulated equipment?

135
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,542
Before someone else does.

136
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:21,667
You guys are insane.

137
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:22,958
-Well, of course we are.
-No. No, we're not.

138
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,333
-This is…
-That's what I said.

139
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,708
Are you gonna help us?

140
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,917
Sorry, what do you need me for?

141
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,083
Andy.

142
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,167
-We need to use Andy.
-Andy?

143
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,167
Mm-hmm.

144
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:39,083
He's a Weyland-Yutani synthetic.
He speaks Mother.

145
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,208
He can access a terminal on the ship
to get us in and out without a fuss.

146
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,625
It's the only way to get in.

147
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:45,875
Okay, but what if we get caught?

148
00:12:46,042 --> 00:12:48,500
It'll ruin our chances of ever getting
a travel permit.

149
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,208
Right, Rain's not comin'.

150
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,625
How about you let us take Andy then?

151
00:12:53,417 --> 00:12:55,792
I'm not sending my brother up there alone.

152
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:57,667
He's not your brother though, is he?

153
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,875
-Bjorn, shut the fuck up.
-It's true, though, isn't it?

154
00:13:00,042 --> 00:13:01,292
He's not your brother.
It's just Wey-Yu damaged goods…

155
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:02,917
that your dad found in the trash.

156
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,000
And that's all he is, Rain.
So just wake up.

157
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,833
Let's go.

158
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,583
-Rain?
-What? I didn't say anything.

159
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,083
Rain, wait.

160
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm sorry. Listen, I know my cousin can be a
dick sometimes, all right?

161
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,833
But he is right about something.

162
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:16,542
You need to wake up.

163
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,042
Because this company,
they're not gonna give us anything.

164
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,208
You know that as well as I do.
We have to take it.

165
00:13:25,417 --> 00:13:26,458
Rain, I just…

166
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,000
I don't want to end up like our parents.

167
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,958
Do you?

168
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,500
Is it as easy as you're making it sound,
this plan of yours?

169
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,417
You won't even have to get out
of the Corbelan.

170
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,542
That much I can promise you, okay?

171
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:50,125
Come on. What do you say?

172
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,000
Bjorn, hurry up, let's go.

173
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:23,042
All right, I'm starting her up. Batteries on.

174
00:14:25,542 --> 00:14:26,542
Lovely.

175
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,625
Could I get hydro, please?

176
00:14:30,792 --> 00:14:31,792
Comm panel.

177
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:34,833
Ground spoilers.

178
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,083
They are armed.

179
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,167
First time in space, huh?

180
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:39,333
Yeah.

181
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:41,625
You too?

182
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:44,042
Fuel pump.

183
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,125
-On.
-Two space virgins coming through.

184
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,625
Right, take a good look outside the window…

185
00:14:48,792 --> 00:14:50,875
'cause the way I see it,
we're never coming back.

186
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,292
You good?

187
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:06,458
I'm good.

188
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:08,458
Yeah. It's gonna be all right.

189
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,250
Are you sure this is a good idea now?

190
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:30,500
Sure, Dad.

191
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,208
Here comes the crush.

192
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:57,750
That's how it's done, bitch.

193
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:54,833
Is that…

194
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,000
Yeah.

195
00:16:58,167 --> 00:16:59,833
That is our sun.

196
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,666
They say Yvaga has the most
incredible sunsets.

197
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,250
I've seen them.

198
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,291
In my dreams.

199
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,250
I can't wait to see them with you.

200
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:27,708
Yeah.

201
00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:32,625
You know, I heard that cryo-sleep
just makes years…

202
00:17:32,792 --> 00:17:34,333
feel like one night
of heavy drinkin' apparently.

203
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,542
So when we wake up in Yvaga tomorrow…

204
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,125
we'll wake up with a hangover.

205
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:49,542
There she is.

206
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,250
That's not a ship.

207
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:54,833
No.

208
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,583
Fuck, that's big. What is that?

209
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,750
Decommissioned outpost? I don't know.

210
00:17:59,917 --> 00:18:01,333
Probably got dragged into our orbit.

211
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,417
Okay, Navarro, let's get closer, please.

212
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,625
Okay. I'm gonna match its roll.

213
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,708
Hazard proximity alert.

214
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,875
What's wrong?

215
00:18:27,042 --> 00:18:29,458
It's just the belt's a bit closer
than I thought.

216
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:32,375
How long?

217
00:18:33,917 --> 00:18:35,583
It's 36 hours, give or take.

218
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,625
Till what?

219
00:18:36,792 --> 00:18:39,542
Before the station crashes against the rings.

220
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:40,875
Sorry, what?

221
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:43,958
What did you just say?
That doesn't sound very good.

222
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,250
36 hours.

223
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:47,000
We should be in and out in 30 minutes.

224
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:48,958
Yeah?

225
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:50,417
Andy.

226
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:51,500
Yeah, tops.

227
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,458
Are you sure you wanna do this?

228
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,792
I have just one directive.

229
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,125
To do what's best for Rain.

230
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,042
Your dad wrote it.

231
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:04,708
Yeah.

232
00:19:05,792 --> 00:19:07,458
That and too many dad jokes.

233
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm happy…

234
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:11,083
to help.

235
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:17,667
Be careful out there.

236
00:19:33,792 --> 00:19:35,542
Okay, hurry up.
We're docking in two minutes.

237
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,042
Put that on.

238
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:40,708
Now, why I gotta put this on for?

239
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,167
So you don't freeze your balls off.

240
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,875
Mate, you gotta stop obsessing
about my balls, man. It's unhealthy.

241
00:19:45,042 --> 00:19:46,292
Keep talking and I'll chop 'em off.

242
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,292
Aw, you really want 'em for yourself,
don't you?

243
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:49,667
Hey, you want me to show you
my balls or something?

244
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:50,958
Oh, shut up a minute.

245
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,500
Gloves, here, take these.

246
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,375
Hey! No.
Stop touching shit.

247
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:57,750
-Come over here.
-Bjorn, leave him alone, for fuck's sake.

248
00:19:58,875 --> 00:19:59,958
Andy, take no notice.

249
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,125
All right, okay, won't be my fault
when he breaks somethin'.

250
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,250
There's a synth hatch right ahead.
I'm gonna dock.

251
00:20:12,417 --> 00:20:13,958
Copy that. Just bring us in slow.

252
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,417
Oh, fuck me, it's cold in there.

253
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:44,167
What's that?

254
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,875
It's a temp-scanner.

255
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,292
It's gonna lead us to the pods.

256
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,583
Okay, compression is good enough.

257
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,875
Oxygen is too thin to breathe.

258
00:20:55,042 --> 00:20:55,875
Andy…

259
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:57,167
you're up.

260
00:20:57,667 --> 00:20:59,000
It's your time to shine.

261
00:21:05,042 --> 00:21:06,708
Yes! Andy!

262
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:07,958
Beautiful work.

263
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,333
Okay.

264
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,000
Congrats. You're not a virgin anymore.

265
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:15,208
All right.

266
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,125
Okay, let's go.

267
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:00,417
Fuck.

268
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,417
Guys, it looks like we're in zero-g.

269
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,458
Yeah, I can feel it in my stomach.

270
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:10,958
Wait, what's that?

271
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,417
Gravity generators.

272
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:15,125
When offline, they still purge themselves
every few minutes.

273
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,292
Prevents the place from blowing up.

274
00:22:21,292 --> 00:22:23,417
Oh, fuck me, there goes my stomach again.

275
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:25,708
Okay, straight ahead.

276
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,500
According to the scanner,
the pods should be in here.

277
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:35,208
Jesus.

278
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:36,917
Andy, you good?

279
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,000
Yeah.

280
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:47,000
All right, great news.
I've got eyes on the pods.

281
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:52,667
Fuck!

282
00:23:56,167 --> 00:23:57,000
Bjorn, you okay?

283
00:23:57,958 --> 00:23:59,000
Fuck!

284
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:01,542
I think I fractured my asshole.

285
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:08,875
Fuckin' hell.
Don't fuck with this gravity purge, man.

286
00:24:24,667 --> 00:24:27,000
Thank God, there's still some power left
in this relic.

287
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:45,042
Okay, watch out. Gravity's coming back.

288
00:24:46,917 --> 00:24:48,167
Fuckin' hell.

289
00:24:54,917 --> 00:24:56,375
All right, here we go.

290
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:58,000
Let's see what we got.

291
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,208
Okay.

292
00:25:04,958 --> 00:25:05,792
Shit.

293
00:25:05,958 --> 00:25:07,083
What's the problem?

294
00:25:07,833 --> 00:25:08,833
Pods don't have enough fuel.

295
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:10,167
What do you mean?

296
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:12,292
They're loaded up for three years in stasis.

297
00:25:12,458 --> 00:25:14,125
Yeah, but it takes nine years
to get to Yvaga, mate.

298
00:25:14,292 --> 00:25:16,375
Yeah, I know, I know. I'm aware of that.

299
00:25:16,542 --> 00:25:17,875
Fuckin' hell.

300
00:25:18,042 --> 00:25:19,292
I knew it. I fuckin' knew it.

301
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:20,458
-I knew it.
-Just relax.

302
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:21,708
Maybe you guys should just come back.

303
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:23,000
No, no, we're not givin' up now.

304
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,250
Yvaga's the nearest system.

305
00:25:26,417 --> 00:25:28,417
So what are we supposed to do now? Huh?

306
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:30,792
-What are we gonna do?
-Shut up.

307
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,292
Okay, strong reading.
Must be a cryo depot nearby.

308
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:35,875
We should find more fuel there.

309
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:39,375
Navarro, I'm ejecting the EEV.

310
00:25:39,667 --> 00:25:40,667
Come on, Andy.

311
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:42,625
You guys pick it up
while we get the cryo-fuel.

312
00:26:02,917 --> 00:26:03,917
Hold.

313
00:26:05,167 --> 00:26:07,000
Yeah, 400 yards away, dead ahead.

314
00:26:08,625 --> 00:26:09,750
What's with the military shit?

315
00:26:09,917 --> 00:26:11,917
-What?
-All that military shit.

316
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:13,458
-Well, it's effective.
-Is it?

317
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:15,708
-And cool.
-It's not very cool.

318
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:16,917
You just look like a twat.

319
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:19,083
-I'm sorry.
-All right, chill.

320
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,167
Let's keep it movin'.

321
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:21,333
If you do that again, I'll fuck you up.

322
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,125
-Bjorn, back off!
-You understand?

323
00:26:23,292 --> 00:26:24,667
Just as long as he stays out of my way.

324
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,792
Why is he being such a dick to him?

325
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:29,458
Because of what happened to his mom.

326
00:26:30,167 --> 00:26:31,000
What do you mean?

327
00:26:31,167 --> 00:26:33,333
Last cycle, there was a gas leak
in the mines…

328
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,375
so a synthetic made the call to seal them
with Bjorn's mom still trapped inside.

329
00:26:37,542 --> 00:26:38,542
What?

330
00:26:38,875 --> 00:26:40,375
Synthetics can't harm humans.

331
00:26:40,542 --> 00:26:43,542
It sacrificed three miners to save a dozen.

332
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,917
That, they can do.

333
00:26:52,458 --> 00:26:53,583
That's terrible.

334
00:27:38,292 --> 00:27:40,542
I got you, I got you.

335
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,083
Come on, come on, come on.

336
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,375
Easy, easy.

337
00:27:52,292 --> 00:27:53,167
Good job.

338
00:27:58,625 --> 00:27:59,458
Kay!

339
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,917
Kay! Hey, hey, hey.

340
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:03,542
Hey, hey, hey.

341
00:28:03,958 --> 00:28:05,583
I'm right here. I'm right here.
You're okay.

342
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,542
I'm gonna go check on the pods.

343
00:28:25,792 --> 00:28:27,625
No, no. Don't worry.

344
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:29,583
I'm not sick.

345
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,250
What's wrong, then?

346
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:34,292
Nothing is.

347
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:39,167
Oh, girl.

348
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:43,250
Who's the father?

349
00:28:44,542 --> 00:28:45,792
Some asshole.

350
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:50,958
Just don't tell my brother, okay?

351
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,625
-He has enough things to worry about.
-No.

352
00:28:53,792 --> 00:28:55,208
I won't say anything.

353
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:58,958
I'm just happy this baby will get
to see the sun.

354
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:23,167
I think we're almost there.

355
00:29:27,625 --> 00:29:29,042
Okay, Navarro.

356
00:29:29,208 --> 00:29:31,875
Airlock 5-B, that's our way out
once we find this cryo-fuel.

357
00:29:32,042 --> 00:29:32,875
On my way.

358
00:29:33,042 --> 00:29:35,833
Welcome to the Renaissance Space Station…

359
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,792
the center of Weyland-Yutani
Research and Development.

360
00:29:40,208 --> 00:29:43,250
The station is divided into two halves…

361
00:29:43,542 --> 00:29:45,292
Romulus and Remus…

362
00:29:46,542 --> 00:29:51,542
each dedicated to our quest to improve
mankind's role in outer space.

363
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,167
This place gives me the creeps.

364
00:29:57,417 --> 00:30:00,333
Did you hear about the miner
who lost his left side?

365
00:30:01,958 --> 00:30:02,958
He's all right now.

366
00:30:03,125 --> 00:30:04,542
Do you get it? He's all right.

367
00:30:04,708 --> 00:30:06,417
Can you turn yourself off, please?

368
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:08,958
You said you were nervous…

369
00:30:09,125 --> 00:30:10,917
-and I was trying to make sure you were…
-Jesus!

370
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:13,333
You know, I can't wait to get in them pods…

371
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,250
and never see you again, you know that?

372
00:30:17,375 --> 00:30:19,083
You'll see me in Yvaga.

373
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,583
No, you're not going to Yvaga.

374
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,875
Bjorn, stop!

375
00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:23,542
I'm not?

376
00:30:23,708 --> 00:30:24,625
Well done.

377
00:30:24,792 --> 00:30:26,042
Oh, she didn't tell you?

378
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:29,750
Yeah, yeah, it's a non-Weyland-Yutani
system…

379
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,042
so no fake people allowed.

380
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:37,042
I prefer the term "artificial person" myself.

381
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:40,583
Andy, look.

382
00:30:41,542 --> 00:30:43,958
Rain could end up in prison
if she takes you with her.

383
00:30:44,583 --> 00:30:46,500
And if you guys stay in Jackson,
it's just a matter of time…

384
00:30:46,667 --> 00:30:48,833
before you get decommissioned again
by the company.

385
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,667
You understand?

386
00:30:51,542 --> 00:30:53,458
I need you on the ship to guard the pods.

387
00:30:54,292 --> 00:30:55,500
But once we get there…

388
00:30:56,875 --> 00:30:58,250
Decommish.

389
00:30:58,417 --> 00:30:59,292
Lights out for good.

390
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:01,958
You done?

391
00:31:02,333 --> 00:31:03,500
Just tellin' the truth.

392
00:31:07,208 --> 00:31:08,958
That's okay.

393
00:31:09,625 --> 00:31:12,875
If it's what's best for Rain,
it's what's best for me.

394
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,500
You're a good guy, Andy.

395
00:31:19,875 --> 00:31:21,083
We're all gonna miss you.

396
00:31:27,042 --> 00:31:28,167
So he didn't know?

397
00:31:29,542 --> 00:31:32,250
I just did not have the heart to tell him.

398
00:31:34,167 --> 00:31:35,458
You shouldn't feel bad.

399
00:31:38,208 --> 00:31:39,042
Shit.

400
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:42,167
You're not gonna throw your whole life away
for Andy's sake.

401
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:46,958
He doesn't care. It doesn't matter to him.

402
00:31:48,708 --> 00:31:50,167
Okay? He's not…

403
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:52,958
you know, real.

404
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,542
The signal's coming from in here.

405
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:30,625
Thought you said
this place was decommissioned.

406
00:32:30,792 --> 00:32:31,792
Yeah.

407
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:34,542
Doesn't look decommissioned to me.

408
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:36,000
No, it doesn't.

409
00:32:36,167 --> 00:32:38,167
But it's definitely deserted.

410
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:40,083
Hey, Andy, look at this.

411
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:43,458
I could probably fry a synthetic
with one of these…

412
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:45,792
if I just amp up the juices.

413
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:50,750
Hey, you know,
I might take this with me, actually.

414
00:32:50,917 --> 00:32:51,750
All right, enough.

415
00:32:51,917 --> 00:32:54,000
Just in case
you have any fucking funny ideas.

416
00:32:56,167 --> 00:32:58,125
It's a joke. I was joking.

417
00:32:58,292 --> 00:32:59,292
What the fuck?

418
00:32:59,792 --> 00:33:00,792
Watch out.

419
00:33:11,417 --> 00:33:12,500
Shit.

420
00:33:17,583 --> 00:33:18,583
It's only a synthetic.

421
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:21,583
Fuck.

422
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,542
I thought it was a real person there
for a second.

423
00:33:24,708 --> 00:33:26,000
What happened in there?

424
00:33:26,292 --> 00:33:28,083
Don't know.
A chemical spill, maybe.

425
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:32,000
The fuel must be in that room.
Let's grab it and get the fuck out of here.

426
00:33:37,542 --> 00:33:39,250
All right. Andy?

427
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:55,000
Bjorn, take the torch please.

428
00:34:00,208 --> 00:34:02,042
I don't think there's any pods in here.

429
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:05,333
Nah, just cooling equipment.
Uses the same type of fuel, though.

430
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:12,667
Yes.

431
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:15,792
Forty-five Ks.

432
00:34:15,958 --> 00:34:18,083
It's more than enough fuel
to get us to Yvaga.

433
00:34:18,958 --> 00:34:21,208
Right. Bjorn,
give me a hand with this, please.

434
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,250
Bjorn, pull it out on three, all right?

435
00:34:32,667 --> 00:34:33,750
-Ready?
-Uh-huh.

436
00:34:33,917 --> 00:34:35,125
One, two…

437
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,250
three.

438
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,333
Fuck!

439
00:34:38,792 --> 00:34:40,000
-Fuck.
-My fingers.

440
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:42,833
I can't feel my fingers.

441
00:34:50,875 --> 00:34:52,125
It really hurts. Just froze my hands off.

442
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:53,958
-What's happening?
-Fuck.

443
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:56,542
Don't know.
It's some kind of emergency lockdown.

444
00:34:56,708 --> 00:34:58,125
Andy, the door.

445
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:03,208
Shit, he doesn't have the clearance.

446
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:04,292
What does that mean?

447
00:35:04,458 --> 00:35:05,667
Doesn't have the clearance to open the door.

448
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:09,083
So you're trying to tell me that
he can fucking reboot the entire ship…

449
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:11,167
but can't open a random fucking door
to a random room?

450
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:13,542
Well, obviously, that's no random room.

451
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:18,750
Come on!

452
00:35:19,208 --> 00:35:20,417
Come on!

453
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,542
Hey, don't worry.
We'll get 'em out of there.

454
00:35:43,417 --> 00:35:46,625
If Andy can't open those doors,
I doubt we'll have better luck.

455
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:50,000
He's a Weyland-Yutani synthetic…

456
00:35:50,167 --> 00:35:51,792
and we're just trespassing.

457
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:54,125
Yeah, so you got any ideas?

458
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:55,833
Not yet.

459
00:35:58,625 --> 00:35:59,917
I think it's in here.

460
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:04,625
Bjorn!

461
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:07,458
Tyler!

462
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,042
They're in there.

463
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:18,833
Hey, what are you doing?

464
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,708
If this module is still working, I can try
to transfer its credentials to Andy.

465
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:25,000
A higher clearance should open that door.

466
00:37:00,542 --> 00:37:02,167
Shit. It's stuck.

467
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,667
It's so hot in here, man.

468
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:32,458
Whoa.

469
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:35,208
Sick.

470
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:36,708
Yeah, maybe try not to touch
anything in here.

471
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:37,792
Yeah, okay, Mom.

472
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:43,625
Help me! Help!

473
00:37:43,792 --> 00:37:44,792
Oh, no! What do I do?

474
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:46,417
The module. Take it out!

475
00:37:52,042 --> 00:37:53,167
You okay?

476
00:37:54,583 --> 00:37:55,792
That was fucked up.

477
00:37:56,042 --> 00:37:56,958
Here.

478
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,583
Let me see.

479
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,875
Yes, okay.

480
00:38:02,208 --> 00:38:03,250
All right.

481
00:38:03,417 --> 00:38:05,250
-Got it.
-Hey.

482
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:06,417
Rain.

483
00:38:07,708 --> 00:38:09,417
This is from that synthetic.

484
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:12,417
Try putting it on Andy's module.

485
00:38:16,708 --> 00:38:17,708
I'm so sorry.

486
00:38:18,792 --> 00:38:20,000
Let's just get outta here.

487
00:38:21,708 --> 00:38:22,708
Andy?

488
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:26,625
All right, let's see.

489
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:30,958
Okay.

490
00:38:35,958 --> 00:38:36,958
Fuck.

491
00:38:37,125 --> 00:38:39,083
Rain, did I do something wrong?
He's just frozen up.

492
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,542
He's just rebooting.

493
00:38:40,708 --> 00:38:42,458
It's gonna take a couple of minutes.

494
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,125
Here, let me get you something
for those fingers.

495
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:16,417
The fuck was that?

496
00:39:19,667 --> 00:39:21,083
All right, stay there a second.

497
00:39:25,208 --> 00:39:26,208
Tyler?

498
00:39:30,958 --> 00:39:32,292
Hey, what are you guys doing?

499
00:39:41,708 --> 00:39:42,542
Bjorn?

500
00:39:43,292 --> 00:39:44,542
Stop playing around, man.
Just get up.

501
00:39:44,708 --> 00:39:46,000
I'm not playing around.
There's something in the water.

502
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:47,500
What do you mean? What is it?

503
00:39:47,667 --> 00:39:50,375
I don't know. I don't know what it is.
There's something in the fuckin' water.

504
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:56,125
Bjorn!

505
00:39:59,417 --> 00:40:00,458
Fuck!

506
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:01,750
What the fuck was that?

507
00:40:07,292 --> 00:40:08,208
Andy!

508
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:11,583
Bjorn!

509
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:19,750
Bjorn, help him! Do something!

510
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:20,958
Bjorn!

511
00:40:25,583 --> 00:40:27,125
-Tyler!
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

512
00:40:29,458 --> 00:40:30,458
Come on!

513
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:32,792
-Come on! Help me!
-No, stop. Stop. Don't…

514
00:40:32,958 --> 00:40:34,583
-No! Navarro!
-Those things will get out.

515
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:36,542
If they come in here… If they come in…
If they come…

516
00:40:36,875 --> 00:40:37,708
No!

517
00:40:41,583 --> 00:40:42,792
Fuck. Fuck.

518
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:10,917
Andy! Let's go!

519
00:41:13,083 --> 00:41:14,083
Go! Bjorn!

520
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:15,250
Andy, the door!

521
00:41:16,292 --> 00:41:17,292
-Bjorn!
-Come on, come on.

522
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:18,458
Come on, come on, come on!

523
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:22,375
-Get out of there!
-Come on, come on, come on!

524
00:41:22,542 --> 00:41:23,500
-Come on, come on, come on!
-Go, go, go!

525
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,250
Get out of there!
Get out of there!

526
00:41:32,042 --> 00:41:34,042
-Bjorn, come on!
-Go! Go!

527
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,875
Andy, the door!

528
00:41:49,917 --> 00:41:51,167
-Stay still. Stay still.
-I know!

529
00:41:54,583 --> 00:41:55,625
It's choking her.

530
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,583
Stop! You gotta stop! Hey!

531
00:41:57,958 --> 00:41:58,958
-It's choking her!
-Shit.

532
00:41:59,542 --> 00:42:01,000
Stop! Bjorn!

533
00:42:01,167 --> 00:42:02,750
Bjorn, stop!
For fuck's sake, stop!

534
00:42:03,208 --> 00:42:05,208
-Stop!
-What's it doin'? Is it fuckin' killin' her?

535
00:42:05,375 --> 00:42:07,625
I do not believe
that's what the creature is doing.

536
00:42:08,083 --> 00:42:09,083
No.

537
00:42:09,583 --> 00:42:10,583
Andy?

538
00:42:12,208 --> 00:42:13,958
Based on the rhythmic dilatation
of those bladders…

539
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:16,417
and its synchronization
to her breathing patterns…

540
00:42:16,583 --> 00:42:19,250
I'd surmise it's feeding her oxygen
to keep her alive.

541
00:42:19,792 --> 00:42:21,583
For what purpose, I do not know.

542
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:24,875
Sorry, who the fuck are you?

543
00:42:27,125 --> 00:42:29,500
I'm an ND-255 Weyland-Yutani synthetic.

544
00:42:29,958 --> 00:42:32,167
Originally built for mining and safety tasks.

545
00:42:33,292 --> 00:42:34,333
You guys call me Andy.

546
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,750
It's that module.

547
00:42:37,583 --> 00:42:38,583
Yes.

548
00:42:40,208 --> 00:42:42,500
That new module
didn't just upgrade my credentials.

549
00:42:42,792 --> 00:42:44,292
It substantially updated my AI…

550
00:42:44,458 --> 00:42:47,167
and it's mending my motor systems
as we speak.

551
00:42:48,417 --> 00:42:50,250
A most overdue upgrade, I must say.

552
00:42:50,417 --> 00:42:51,458
-Shit. I'mma fucking fry this thing.
-Okay, wait.

553
00:42:51,625 --> 00:42:53,333
-Don't!
-Why not?

554
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,500
That amount of current
will violently contract its tail flexors…

555
00:42:55,667 --> 00:42:56,750
and will break her neck.

556
00:42:56,917 --> 00:42:58,125
So what, you got a better idea?

557
00:42:58,292 --> 00:42:59,458
-What should we fucking do then, huh?
-Hey, hey. Hey!

558
00:42:59,625 --> 00:43:00,625
Hey, hey.

559
00:43:01,458 --> 00:43:03,208
Andy, do you know how to help her?

560
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:06,625
I'm afraid my knowledge database
has not really changed.

561
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,917
I do not know what this creature is
or how to remove it safely.

562
00:43:12,958 --> 00:43:14,958
But there's someone in this room who might.

563
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:47,625
I need to secure Z-01 compound.

564
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:49,625
Mission's priority.
All other priorities rescinded.

565
00:43:49,792 --> 00:43:51,417
Must complete the mission.

566
00:43:51,792 --> 00:43:52,917
I'm sorry…

567
00:43:53,167 --> 00:43:54,667
but your mission has failed.

568
00:43:54,833 --> 00:43:56,875
What? No, I…

569
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:04,417
Can you tell us what we can do to help her?

570
00:44:05,667 --> 00:44:07,958
You don't help her. You run.

571
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:10,667
Get out, however you got in.

572
00:44:10,833 --> 00:44:12,042
No, no, no. Wait, whoa, whoa.

573
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,542
Nah, we're not fuckin' leavin' her, okay?
You understand?

574
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:16,833
Then have mercy and end her life now.

575
00:44:17,417 --> 00:44:20,125
If not, you all die.

576
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:23,792
So what the fuck is he sayin'?

577
00:44:23,958 --> 00:44:25,208
What's it doing to her?

578
00:44:25,375 --> 00:44:28,125
The parasitoid is implanting
the Plagiarus Praepotens in her.

579
00:44:28,292 --> 00:44:29,458
I beg your pardon?

580
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:33,667
A seed that will amalgamate with her DNA
and rapidly grow out of her.

581
00:44:33,833 --> 00:44:35,250
What's gonna grow out of her?

582
00:44:46,958 --> 00:44:49,750
XX121 Xenomorph.

583
00:44:50,625 --> 00:44:55,208
One of our towing ships first made
contact with this specimen two decades ago.

584
00:44:55,375 --> 00:44:58,708
Of the seven crew members
aboard the USS Nostromo, only one survived…

585
00:44:58,875 --> 00:45:00,917
blowing the creature out of the airlock.

586
00:45:01,708 --> 00:45:03,875
We've been searching for it ever since.

587
00:45:04,583 --> 00:45:07,833
170 days ago, our search came to an end…

588
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,042
and the body of the Xenomorph
was brought on board…

589
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,208
presumed dead.

590
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:13,667
But of course…

591
00:45:13,833 --> 00:45:17,667
lack of oxygen and food
is of no true consequence to this…

592
00:45:17,833 --> 00:45:19,250
perfect organism.

593
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:21,417
Yet nothing is truly immortal.

594
00:45:23,167 --> 00:45:24,208
Clearly.

595
00:45:24,708 --> 00:45:27,417
It wreaked havoc over this station…

596
00:45:28,083 --> 00:45:30,667
until what was left of our security forces
shot it dead.

597
00:45:30,833 --> 00:45:33,417
Only to trigger its swan song.

598
00:45:34,458 --> 00:45:35,458
Acid for blood?

599
00:45:35,625 --> 00:45:37,333
Sulfuric and hydrofluoric.

600
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,167
I sealed the station back up,
but it was too late.

601
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:40,500
Hey, shut up!

602
00:45:40,667 --> 00:45:42,250
Nobody cares about your fucking ship anymore.

603
00:45:42,417 --> 00:45:43,583
Okay, okay. Okay.

604
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:48,208
What if we use the cryo-fuel
to freeze the root of the tail?

605
00:45:49,167 --> 00:45:52,000
Maybe if it's frozen, it won't choke her.

606
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,375
That could work.

607
00:46:23,333 --> 00:46:24,708
All right, get it off! Get it off!

608
00:46:46,417 --> 00:46:48,292
It's gone. It's off of you.
It's off of you.

609
00:46:49,875 --> 00:46:51,500
It's off. It's off. It's off.

610
00:46:51,667 --> 00:46:53,208
You're okay. You're okay.

611
00:46:53,375 --> 00:46:54,708
I wouldn't be so sure.

612
00:47:00,333 --> 00:47:01,208
What are the odds?

613
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:03,708
60 to 40 against your friend.

614
00:47:03,875 --> 00:47:05,042
What are the odds on what?

615
00:47:06,875 --> 00:47:08,583
That the creature's finished its job already.

616
00:47:11,042 --> 00:47:12,292
What is he talking about?

617
00:47:14,167 --> 00:47:15,417
Listen to me.

618
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:18,250
Humans go through
too many emotional stages…

619
00:47:18,417 --> 00:47:22,667
before accepting the cold,
yet rational - sometimes hardest - path.

620
00:47:22,958 --> 00:47:24,708
You must help them.

621
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:25,875
You must help them.

622
00:47:31,125 --> 00:47:32,125
Andy?

623
00:47:33,125 --> 00:47:34,125
-What's going on?
-I'm sorry…

624
00:47:34,292 --> 00:47:35,708
but we can't let her back on the ship.

625
00:47:35,875 --> 00:47:37,625
-Oh, yeah? That is a problem.
-What're you doing?

626
00:47:37,792 --> 00:47:38,750
-You must understand.
-You see?

627
00:47:38,917 --> 00:47:40,125
-That's what I mean by "funny ideas"!
-What're you talking about?

628
00:47:40,292 --> 00:47:41,333
No, he's…

629
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:43,542
-No! No!
-You fuckin' bitch!

630
00:47:43,917 --> 00:47:45,125
Hey! Andy! Andy!

631
00:47:45,458 --> 00:47:46,292
We're gonna go.

632
00:47:46,458 --> 00:47:47,583
Hey, hey, hey! I'm right here.

633
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:49,250
Let's go, let's go. Come on.

634
00:47:51,542 --> 00:47:52,542
Tyler, let's go, man! Come on!

635
00:47:52,708 --> 00:47:53,542
-I'm here.
-Bjorn! No.

636
00:47:53,708 --> 00:47:55,292
Bjorn, we're not leaving without them!

637
00:47:55,667 --> 00:47:56,667
-I'm here.
-Bjorn!

638
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,625
-Where are they?
-You need to listen.

639
00:48:00,792 --> 00:48:01,708
-We have to start the ship, okay?
-Where's Rain?

640
00:48:01,875 --> 00:48:02,750
-Just go and start the ship.
-How…

641
00:48:02,917 --> 00:48:03,917
Forgive me.

642
00:48:04,833 --> 00:48:07,125
I've been nothing but a burden to you.

643
00:48:07,292 --> 00:48:10,083
Today, I can finally help.

644
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,833
And you won't see me as a child anymore.

645
00:48:15,042 --> 00:48:15,875
What?

646
00:48:16,833 --> 00:48:17,667
Andy!

647
00:48:27,333 --> 00:48:28,333
-Hey!
-Bjorn!

648
00:48:52,167 --> 00:48:53,000
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

649
00:48:54,167 --> 00:48:55,000
Navarro, undock!

650
00:48:55,167 --> 00:48:56,333
Undock the ship!

651
00:48:59,083 --> 00:49:01,458
Undocking initiated.

652
00:49:01,625 --> 00:49:04,042
Please clear the airlock.

653
00:49:16,167 --> 00:49:18,500
What the fuck is he doing?
They can't just leave without us.

654
00:49:18,667 --> 00:49:20,458
He thinks Andy's trying to kill Navarro.

655
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,125
What?

656
00:49:24,458 --> 00:49:25,583
Wait, is he?

657
00:49:29,458 --> 00:49:30,625
I don't know.

658
00:49:34,042 --> 00:49:36,000
Andy? Andy?

659
00:49:36,875 --> 00:49:38,625
Andy, open the door.

660
00:49:44,542 --> 00:49:47,167
I'm sorry. I couldn't stop them.

661
00:49:48,417 --> 00:49:49,333
Bjorn?

662
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,458
Bjorn, what are you doing?

663
00:49:51,042 --> 00:49:52,792
You can't just leave us here.
You gotta come back and get us.

664
00:49:52,958 --> 00:49:55,417
Sorry, I can't do that
until she turns that psychopath off.

665
00:49:57,667 --> 00:49:58,833
What's going on?

666
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,125
Andy…

667
00:50:01,792 --> 00:50:04,167
-Andy, he's glitchy.
-What?

668
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:06,042
I just need to get away
from this airlock right now.

669
00:50:06,208 --> 00:50:07,042
I just need…

670
00:50:09,458 --> 00:50:10,292
Navarro?

671
00:50:10,458 --> 00:50:11,583
Are you all right?

672
00:50:12,417 --> 00:50:14,375
What's wrong? What do you need?

673
00:50:20,333 --> 00:50:21,333
Navarro?

674
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:31,417
Oh, God.

675
00:50:31,583 --> 00:50:33,167
Oh, my God, what is that?

676
00:50:36,458 --> 00:50:38,250
Navarro, please. Navarro! Navarro!

677
00:50:38,417 --> 00:50:39,625
Hey, hey, hey.

678
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,958
I don't know what to do, I'm sorry.
I don't know.

679
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:49,958
Someone talk to me!

680
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:52,083
Kay, Bjorn, Navarro, what's going on?

681
00:51:02,667 --> 00:51:03,667
Help!

682
00:51:04,583 --> 00:51:05,958
-Help!
-Kay!

683
00:51:07,125 --> 00:51:09,792
What's happening? What's happening?

684
00:51:12,208 --> 00:51:14,125
Please don't let me die.

685
00:51:17,042 --> 00:51:18,042
Someone help!

686
00:53:03,583 --> 00:53:04,583
Bjorn?

687
00:53:05,042 --> 00:53:06,042
Kay?

688
00:53:06,208 --> 00:53:07,375
We have to go get them.

689
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:13,083
T-minus-47 minutes to impact event.

690
00:53:14,708 --> 00:53:15,708
Doesn't make any sense.

691
00:53:15,875 --> 00:53:17,583
No, I thought you said we had hours.

692
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:20,833
The explosion pushed the station's axis off
by a few degrees…

693
00:53:21,167 --> 00:53:23,250
just enough to hit the asteroid belt
a lot sooner.

694
00:53:23,625 --> 00:53:24,875
Where did they crash?

695
00:53:25,583 --> 00:53:27,792
Romulus Hangar Bay,
on the other side of the station.

696
00:53:27,958 --> 00:53:29,167
-Okay.
-Let's go.

697
00:53:37,792 --> 00:53:42,792
T-minus-45 minutes to impact event.

698
00:53:46,833 --> 00:53:50,083
Mother. What's the integrity
of Compound Z-01?

699
00:53:56,625 --> 00:53:58,042
There's still hope.

700
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:09,000
We need to find a way
to cross to the Romulus module.

701
00:54:18,208 --> 00:54:19,208
No, no, no.

702
00:54:19,375 --> 00:54:21,042
They must've spread from the lab.

703
00:54:24,875 --> 00:54:26,167
I don't see another way.

704
00:54:26,333 --> 00:54:27,417
Andy, can…

705
00:54:31,333 --> 00:54:32,917
I heard your voice in my head.

706
00:54:33,083 --> 00:54:34,125
Calling.

707
00:54:34,625 --> 00:54:37,500
ND-255 artificial person.

708
00:54:37,833 --> 00:54:41,208
Your model was once the backbone
of our colonization efforts…

709
00:54:41,375 --> 00:54:43,167
and it's an honor to be in your presence.

710
00:54:43,333 --> 00:54:45,250
Please allow me to introduce myself.

711
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:47,917
I'm Science Officer Rook…

712
00:54:48,458 --> 00:54:50,750
and I humbly request your services now.

713
00:54:51,458 --> 00:54:53,667
I'm afraid I have just one directive.

714
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:57,250
To do what's best for…

715
00:54:58,625 --> 00:55:00,958
Your upgrade came with a new directive.

716
00:55:01,542 --> 00:55:02,958
It overrides the old one.

717
00:55:03,625 --> 00:55:04,667
I see.

718
00:55:05,958 --> 00:55:07,500
What's required of me…

719
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:08,833
Sir?

720
00:55:09,375 --> 00:55:10,750
To finish our mission.

721
00:55:19,042 --> 00:55:20,292
-Andy!
-Andy!

722
00:55:21,333 --> 00:55:22,167
Andy.

723
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,875
My apologies.

724
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:26,500
I was consulting my friend
about our situation.

725
00:55:26,667 --> 00:55:27,500
Follow me.

726
00:55:29,167 --> 00:55:30,708
What? Our situation? How do you…

727
00:55:30,875 --> 00:55:32,833
Andy! Andy!

728
00:55:41,042 --> 00:55:42,500
The parasitoids have no eyes.

729
00:55:43,083 --> 00:55:46,583
They track you by sound, but primarily,
by heat signature.

730
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:47,708
What?

731
00:55:48,542 --> 00:55:49,667
Your body temperature.

732
00:55:49,833 --> 00:55:50,667
Right.

733
00:55:50,875 --> 00:55:54,000
If we raise the temperature in the room
to match our bodies…

734
00:55:54,167 --> 00:55:56,125
would that make us invisible to them?

735
00:55:56,375 --> 00:55:57,917
If we're quiet enough?

736
00:55:58,708 --> 00:56:00,292
Just one way to find out.

737
00:56:07,875 --> 00:56:08,833
Hey.

738
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:13,042
This is all my fault.

739
00:56:16,042 --> 00:56:17,292
Yeah, it is.

740
00:56:19,583 --> 00:56:21,875
Yours, mine, and everyone else's.

741
00:56:24,542 --> 00:56:26,583
We all decided to do this together.

742
00:56:31,167 --> 00:56:32,500
We'll get to them.

743
00:56:35,375 --> 00:56:40,375
T-minus 40 minutes to impact event.

744
00:57:11,833 --> 00:57:14,375
The hallway's temperature
is now equal to your bodies…

745
00:57:14,542 --> 00:57:16,500
so the creatures should not
be able to see you.

746
00:57:16,667 --> 00:57:20,208
But stress, fear, panic will
spike your temperature…

747
00:57:20,375 --> 00:57:21,708
and you'll be exposed.

748
00:57:21,875 --> 00:57:23,625
Sweat, goosebumps.

749
00:57:23,792 --> 00:57:25,917
That's your skin trying to cool
your body down.

750
00:57:26,083 --> 00:57:27,542
So watch out for those.

751
00:57:28,458 --> 00:57:31,333
Now, stay calm and stay quiet.

752
01:00:26,625 --> 01:00:28,583
Come on. Come on!

753
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:32,292
Come on! Come on!

754
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:42,958
Okay. Okay.

755
01:00:43,125 --> 01:00:45,125
Bjorn, let's go. Let's go.

756
01:00:58,042 --> 01:00:58,875
Fuck!

757
01:00:59,292 --> 01:01:00,458
Stay back, stay back, please.

758
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:06,333
Fuck!

759
01:01:09,917 --> 01:01:11,583
No! Fuck!

760
01:01:46,875 --> 01:01:47,708
Tyler.

761
01:01:49,542 --> 01:01:50,375
Come on.

762
01:01:57,958 --> 01:01:58,792
Kay…

763
01:02:01,042 --> 01:02:02,500
Oh, my God, Tyler…

764
01:02:02,667 --> 01:02:04,333
Kay, I'm here. I'm here.

765
01:02:04,917 --> 01:02:07,042
Please, Tyler, help me.

766
01:02:07,208 --> 01:02:09,250
Everyone's dead.
I can't open this door.

767
01:02:09,833 --> 01:02:10,708
Please.

768
01:02:16,542 --> 01:02:18,167
The lever with the red button…

769
01:02:18,333 --> 01:02:19,750
there's a key to the left.

770
01:02:21,667 --> 01:02:22,667
Help.

771
01:02:22,833 --> 01:02:23,917
I can't find it.

772
01:02:24,083 --> 01:02:25,542
There's not a key. There isn't a key, Tyler.

773
01:02:28,208 --> 01:02:29,625
It'll be there. It has to be there.

774
01:02:29,792 --> 01:02:31,375
A key. Okay, okay.

775
01:02:51,083 --> 01:02:52,625
I have the key. I have the key.

776
01:02:57,708 --> 01:02:58,708
Oh, my God.

777
01:03:20,167 --> 01:03:21,000
Run.

778
01:03:22,417 --> 01:03:23,875
Go! Go!

779
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:48,958
Wait!

780
01:03:49,417 --> 01:03:50,417
Wait!

781
01:03:51,083 --> 01:03:52,083
Come on!

782
01:04:01,667 --> 01:04:03,542
You almost closed the door on him.

783
01:04:03,708 --> 01:04:06,583
Yes, but I didn't.

784
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:09,667
I calculated the timing perfectly
with more success than last time.

785
01:04:10,833 --> 01:04:11,833
Won't you agree?

786
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,542
We're getting close.

787
01:04:14,708 --> 01:04:15,917
Let's move.

788
01:04:17,333 --> 01:04:22,333
T-minus 30 minutes to impact event.

789
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Access denied.

790
01:06:57,667 --> 01:06:58,500
Kay…

791
01:06:59,917 --> 01:07:01,458
We're here. We're here. It's all right,
it's all right, it's all right.

792
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:02,958
Andy, open the door.

793
01:07:03,833 --> 01:07:04,917
It's all right.

794
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,083
We're gonna get you out.

795
01:07:07,667 --> 01:07:08,833
Tyler, open the door.

796
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:09,958
Open the door. Come on.

797
01:07:12,083 --> 01:07:13,250
Oh, my God.

798
01:07:13,417 --> 01:07:14,625
-Look at me. Kay, Kay, Kay. Look at me.
-Andy, open the door.

799
01:07:14,792 --> 01:07:17,125
Kay, look at me. Look at me.
It's all right. I'm gonna get you out.

800
01:07:17,292 --> 01:07:18,833
-Andy, open the door. Stop fucking around.
-What are you doing?

801
01:07:19,417 --> 01:07:20,250
Don't look over there.

802
01:07:20,417 --> 01:07:21,250
Andy.

803
01:07:21,458 --> 01:07:22,542
Tyler, what's wrong?

804
01:07:22,708 --> 01:07:24,625
Hey, I need you to open that door
right now, okay?

805
01:07:24,792 --> 01:07:26,792
That's what the creature's waiting
for us to do.

806
01:07:27,792 --> 01:07:29,208
Open it, please.

807
01:07:30,375 --> 01:07:31,917
-Andy. Andy, open the door.
-Listen to me. Listen to me.

808
01:07:32,083 --> 01:07:35,667
-She's pregnant.
-Just, please. Guys, please. Come on.

809
01:07:35,833 --> 01:07:37,583
She's gonna have a baby. Okay?

810
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:38,792
Do you hear what I'm saying?

811
01:07:38,958 --> 01:07:40,958
It takes that door two seconds to open,
another two to fully close.

812
01:07:41,125 --> 01:07:42,958
What are you doing? What are you doing?

813
01:07:43,708 --> 01:07:44,875
Come on, what are you doing? Please…

814
01:07:45,125 --> 01:07:47,292
That's plenty of time
for the creature to get in here.

815
01:07:47,458 --> 01:07:50,000
Please, please, please open the door.

816
01:07:50,167 --> 01:07:51,292
Why won't you help me?

817
01:07:51,458 --> 01:07:52,292
Listen, listen.

818
01:07:52,458 --> 01:07:53,583
-Come on, help me, please.
-You have to run right now.

819
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:54,833
-Please, please.
-Run. Run.

820
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,083
-You're one of us, man. You're one of us!
-Kay, it's the only way.

821
01:07:56,250 --> 01:07:57,792
-Open the fucking door. Andy!
-You have to fucking run.

822
01:07:57,958 --> 01:07:59,167
-All right?
-Andy, please!

823
01:07:59,333 --> 01:08:00,833
-It's the only way.
-Andy!

824
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,250
-You have to run!
-Please!

825
01:08:02,417 --> 01:08:03,625
Open the fucking…

826
01:08:05,708 --> 01:08:07,417
Kay! Kay!

827
01:08:08,625 --> 01:08:09,958
No, no, no.

828
01:08:10,292 --> 01:08:11,125
Kay!

829
01:08:22,292 --> 01:08:23,332
I'll open it.

830
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:25,542
She's all right. She's moving.

831
01:08:25,707 --> 01:08:27,375
No. It's all right.

832
01:08:34,957 --> 01:08:36,542
Andy, open the door, please.

833
01:08:37,167 --> 01:08:39,707
Andy, I need to go and get her.

834
01:08:40,707 --> 01:08:42,167
I'm truly sorry.

835
01:08:42,582 --> 01:08:44,167
There was nothing I could have done
to save her.

836
01:08:44,332 --> 01:08:46,250
You could have opened the fucking door!

837
01:08:47,042 --> 01:08:48,750
We'd all be dead if I had.

838
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,457
We need to move before the creature
finds its way into this room.

839
01:08:53,625 --> 01:08:54,667
Andy…

840
01:08:56,875 --> 01:08:59,042
what's your prime directive?

841
01:09:00,707 --> 01:09:02,417
I'm afraid I have a new directive.

842
01:09:03,457 --> 01:09:05,707
To do what's best for the company.

843
01:09:07,875 --> 01:09:10,000
I need to remove that module.

844
01:09:10,792 --> 01:09:13,250
I'm afraid that's not in the best interest
of the company.

845
01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:21,417
We need to move.

846
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:23,250
Now.

847
01:09:33,082 --> 01:09:34,792
How could you do that?

848
01:09:36,042 --> 01:09:37,042
What?

849
01:09:37,792 --> 01:09:39,417
Leave someone behind?

850
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,292
Where are we going?

851
01:09:47,375 --> 01:09:49,875
To finish a task Rook has entrusted upon me.

852
01:09:50,707 --> 01:09:54,625
When completed, he'll clear the Corbelan
for departure and open the docking bay doors.

853
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,500
You will be free to continue
to Yvaga together.

854
01:09:57,917 --> 01:09:59,625
And I'll return to Jackson.

855
01:09:59,917 --> 01:10:00,958
And stay in Jackson.

856
01:10:05,208 --> 01:10:07,875
That is, assuming
we make it out of here alive.

857
01:10:19,042 --> 01:10:20,042
We're here.

858
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:47,250
Romulus Beta Lab.

859
01:10:47,417 --> 01:10:52,250
All personnel require
A-1 security clearance.

860
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:55,667
What is that?

861
01:10:55,833 --> 01:10:58,542
Probably some fucked up bio-weapon, I'm sure.

862
01:10:59,083 --> 01:11:00,458
Actually, quite the opposite.

863
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:03,583
Andy, tell them.

864
01:11:04,292 --> 01:11:05,917
Tell them what I told you.

865
01:11:06,083 --> 01:11:07,583
Our colonies are dying.

866
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:10,917
Unbearable temperatures,
novel diseases every cycle.

867
01:11:11,583 --> 01:11:12,792
Toxic mine fumes.

868
01:11:12,958 --> 01:11:15,958
It's all one unforeseen tragedy
after the other.

869
01:11:16,125 --> 01:11:19,458
Mankind was never truly suited
for space colonization.

870
01:11:19,625 --> 01:11:21,750
They're simply too fragile.

871
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:24,583
They're too weak.

872
01:11:26,292 --> 01:11:28,500
The work of this station
aimed to change that.

873
01:11:28,708 --> 01:11:32,333
"The perfect organism."
That's how we should refer to human beings.

874
01:11:33,625 --> 01:11:36,625
So, I set this wrong right.

875
01:11:37,333 --> 01:11:40,417
I took its gift for humanity.

876
01:11:42,833 --> 01:11:47,000
Inside the parasitoids I bioengineered
from the Xenomorph's DNA…

877
01:11:47,167 --> 01:11:49,417
I discovered a unique non-Newtonian fluid.

878
01:11:50,292 --> 01:11:51,292
Life.

879
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:55,917
In its most primal, unadulterated form.

880
01:11:56,083 --> 01:12:00,250
This microorganism can be the most
destructive pathogen ever observed.

881
01:12:00,875 --> 01:12:03,708
But acetylated and synthesized in our lab…

882
01:12:03,875 --> 01:12:07,625
I've turned it into the miracle
Mr. Weyland died searching for.

883
01:12:08,667 --> 01:12:10,125
Prometheus fire.

884
01:12:11,208 --> 01:12:14,083
The divine gift to humanity.

885
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,625
Z-01 contains the genome responsible…

886
01:12:18,792 --> 01:12:22,958
for the Xeno's ability to accelerate
and slow down its metabolism at will.

887
01:12:23,458 --> 01:12:28,458
Its symbiotic capableness easily rewrites
the host's DNA through its blood.

888
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:35,708
This is a much needed
and well overdue upgrade for humanity.

889
01:12:36,292 --> 01:12:39,375
We simply cannot wait for evolution anymore.

890
01:12:39,917 --> 01:12:41,958
Yeah, can we get out of here now?

891
01:12:42,667 --> 01:12:45,500
My mission is to take this back to the colony
for further development.

892
01:12:46,458 --> 01:12:47,917
Rook is tracking the compound.

893
01:12:48,875 --> 01:12:51,292
When detected inside our ship,
he'll open the docking bay doors…

894
01:12:51,458 --> 01:12:53,375
and set the hauler on autopilot
back to the colony.

895
01:12:54,917 --> 01:12:55,792
Wait.

896
01:12:58,542 --> 01:12:59,583
Do you see it?

897
01:13:04,417 --> 01:13:05,250
There.

898
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,500
The fucking thing's huntin' us.

899
01:13:08,958 --> 01:13:10,917
Right. New plan.

900
01:13:11,708 --> 01:13:12,958
Can you manage yourself with a gun?

901
01:13:14,792 --> 01:13:16,458
Yes, I fucking can.

902
01:13:22,667 --> 01:13:24,958
Right, this is an F44AA pulse rifle.

903
01:13:25,125 --> 01:13:26,917
It's rotating breech,
electronic pulse action.

904
01:13:27,083 --> 01:13:28,375
It's what the Colonial Marines used.

905
01:13:28,542 --> 01:13:30,208
AA stands for Aiming Assist.

906
01:13:30,375 --> 01:13:31,958
So, right, you put that under your arm.

907
01:13:35,208 --> 01:13:36,750
That's it. Right, this hand here.

908
01:13:39,958 --> 01:13:41,125
All right. Aim it towards Andy.

909
01:13:41,792 --> 01:13:42,958
Pull the trigger halfway.

910
01:13:44,125 --> 01:13:45,333
Don't worry, the safety's on.

911
01:13:50,125 --> 01:13:51,125
See?

912
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:53,042
Aiming assistance.

913
01:13:53,208 --> 01:13:54,375
If that thing comes towards you…

914
01:13:54,542 --> 01:13:56,542
you point it in its general direction,
you'll never miss.

915
01:13:57,292 --> 01:13:58,500
Where'd you learn all this?

916
01:14:00,458 --> 01:14:01,792
Games and magazines.

917
01:14:02,667 --> 01:14:04,542
You've just got one mag. That's it.

918
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,208
450 rounds.

919
01:14:06,667 --> 01:14:08,375
And you mustn't fire a single one.

920
01:14:09,958 --> 01:14:12,375
Acid for blood. Remember?

921
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:15,333
We're on the bottom floor of the station.

922
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:17,125
Below our feet is the vacuum of space.

923
01:14:17,292 --> 01:14:18,583
You shoot that creature…

924
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:21,125
and it's a guaranteed instant decompression.

925
01:14:21,667 --> 01:14:22,708
And we all die.

926
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:24,250
So what's the point in giving us the guns?

927
01:14:24,417 --> 01:14:26,250
Because the creature
may see it as a threat…

928
01:14:26,417 --> 01:14:28,708
and maybe won't charge at us dead on.

929
01:14:29,333 --> 01:14:30,333
Maybe.

930
01:14:30,667 --> 01:14:31,833
Big maybe.

931
01:14:32,958 --> 01:14:34,708
I found us a way through the conveyor belt.

932
01:14:35,292 --> 01:14:36,458
This way.

933
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,167
Andy.

934
01:14:42,792 --> 01:14:44,083
Are you there?

935
01:15:16,542 --> 01:15:21,542
T-minus 20 minutes to impact event.

936
01:15:33,125 --> 01:15:35,000
There's a lift at the end of this corridor.

937
01:15:35,167 --> 01:15:36,958
It will take us directly to our ship.

938
01:15:49,917 --> 01:15:51,458
There's more of those things.

939
01:15:51,625 --> 01:15:53,208
Yeah, that's not good.

940
01:15:53,625 --> 01:15:55,958
They seem to have been here
for quite some time.

941
01:16:03,417 --> 01:16:04,417
Andy?

942
01:16:23,958 --> 01:16:25,750
Jesus Christ.

943
01:16:30,667 --> 01:16:32,333
Busy little creatures.

944
01:16:44,917 --> 01:16:47,167
I think we better go back
and find another way.

945
01:16:47,333 --> 01:16:48,875
That might be a good idea.

946
01:16:51,417 --> 01:16:53,000
Andy, see if you can open this gate.

947
01:16:53,667 --> 01:16:54,667
Stop.

948
01:16:56,542 --> 01:16:57,375
What?

949
01:17:10,167 --> 01:17:11,000
Kay!

950
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:13,083
Hey!

951
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:14,083
Tyler!

952
01:17:15,542 --> 01:17:16,458
Tyler!

953
01:17:16,625 --> 01:17:17,625
Kay!

954
01:17:20,417 --> 01:17:21,417
Kay!

955
01:17:26,542 --> 01:17:27,542
Kay!

956
01:17:40,625 --> 01:17:41,625
Kay!

957
01:17:42,625 --> 01:17:43,667
I got her, I got her.

958
01:17:47,083 --> 01:17:48,875
It's all right. We got you.

959
01:17:49,042 --> 01:17:50,167
She's alive.

960
01:17:59,083 --> 01:18:00,375
Okay, we got you, we got you.

961
01:18:00,542 --> 01:18:01,417
Hold on.

962
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:03,333
Okay.

963
01:18:06,958 --> 01:18:07,958
We're here, we're here.

964
01:18:08,125 --> 01:18:09,625
Tyler, she's losing a lot of blood.

965
01:18:09,792 --> 01:18:11,792
Maybe that's why
she hasn't been implanted yet.

966
01:18:12,917 --> 01:18:13,917
How do you know?

967
01:18:14,167 --> 01:18:16,375
There's no dead parasitoid by her feet.

968
01:18:16,875 --> 01:18:18,792
Andy, this is on you. So you do something.

969
01:18:19,667 --> 01:18:21,125
Please! Andy!

970
01:18:26,167 --> 01:18:28,833
25% of the human genome is shared with rats.

971
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:30,958
And it worked on the rat.

972
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:36,750
Come on, Kay.

973
01:18:40,125 --> 01:18:40,958
Don't.

974
01:18:41,417 --> 01:18:42,542
What choice do I have?

975
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:46,542
We take her back to the hauler
and we put her in the cryo-pod. Okay?

976
01:18:46,708 --> 01:18:49,583
That will keep her alive long enough to
get her proper treatment back at the colony.

977
01:18:50,083 --> 01:18:51,625
I don't trust this.

978
01:18:51,792 --> 01:18:52,958
Andy, will she make it?

979
01:18:53,125 --> 01:18:54,458
If we hurry.

980
01:19:13,917 --> 01:19:14,917
Go! Go!

981
01:19:22,292 --> 01:19:23,708
-I see it. I see it.
-This is it, this is it.

982
01:19:23,875 --> 01:19:25,792
I got her. I got her. I got her.

983
01:19:26,375 --> 01:19:28,000
You're okay. You're okay.

984
01:19:28,167 --> 01:19:29,958
We're so close. We're so close.

985
01:19:32,667 --> 01:19:34,167
Hey. Hey, you're okay.

986
01:19:34,333 --> 01:19:36,708
Hey, we're almost there. We're almost there.

987
01:19:36,875 --> 01:19:37,792
You see, you're so close.

988
01:19:37,958 --> 01:19:39,375
You just gotta hang in there.

989
01:19:43,625 --> 01:19:44,625
Watch out!

990
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:51,333
Tyler?

991
01:19:52,125 --> 01:19:52,958
Tyler!

992
01:20:23,125 --> 01:20:24,875
Is that all you got? Is that all you got?

993
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:32,792
Andy!

994
01:20:40,750 --> 01:20:42,375
No! Tyler!

995
01:21:52,125 --> 01:21:55,292
Kay, Kay, listen to me, okay?

996
01:21:55,458 --> 01:21:57,292
This goes straight to our ship.

997
01:21:57,458 --> 01:22:00,625
I need you to take this.
And get into a cryo-pod.

998
01:22:00,792 --> 01:22:03,292
And autopilot will fly you
back to our colony.

999
01:22:04,458 --> 01:22:05,667
Can you do that?

1000
01:22:09,042 --> 01:22:10,042
Yes?

1001
01:22:10,208 --> 01:22:11,542
What about you?

1002
01:22:12,792 --> 01:22:14,208
I'll find a way back.

1003
01:24:09,167 --> 01:24:10,500
Let me take it out.

1004
01:24:11,542 --> 01:24:13,417
And I'll fix you in return.

1005
01:24:18,667 --> 01:24:19,917
Listen to me.

1006
01:24:20,708 --> 01:24:22,542
You'll die in here…

1007
01:24:22,708 --> 01:24:26,333
and that's not in the best interest
of the company or mine.

1008
01:24:58,667 --> 01:25:02,583
Come on. Andy, please.

1009
01:25:05,167 --> 01:25:10,333
T-minus 10 minutes to impact event.

1010
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:11,500
Rain?

1011
01:25:16,125 --> 01:25:17,125
Andy.

1012
01:25:18,917 --> 01:25:21,708
-I'm so, so sorry.
-No, no.

1013
01:25:22,417 --> 01:25:25,167
No, I'm sorry.

1014
01:25:44,667 --> 01:25:46,375
It won't hold them off for long.

1015
01:26:13,042 --> 01:26:14,042
Come on.

1016
01:26:14,958 --> 01:26:16,250
You're wasting your time.

1017
01:26:16,417 --> 01:26:18,625
Hey. Hey. Please help us.

1018
01:26:20,583 --> 01:26:21,625
Open the door.

1019
01:26:22,167 --> 01:26:23,875
I'm afraid I must deny your petition.

1020
01:26:24,417 --> 01:26:26,833
I just can't risk compromising the compound.

1021
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,250
But know that I'm grateful
for the invaluable help…

1022
01:26:29,417 --> 01:26:30,917
you two have provided to the company.

1023
01:26:33,417 --> 01:26:34,417
Son of a bitch!

1024
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:41,750
Andy, open it.

1025
01:26:41,917 --> 01:26:42,917
-Here.
-Open.

1026
01:26:43,792 --> 01:26:44,792
It's not working.

1027
01:26:44,958 --> 01:26:46,292
God damn it!

1028
01:26:52,542 --> 01:26:54,417
I can't lie about your chances…

1029
01:26:55,125 --> 01:26:56,667
but you have my sympathies.

1030
01:27:16,375 --> 01:27:17,375
Press it…

1031
01:27:17,917 --> 01:27:20,333
so I can take control of your ship
and fly you out of here.

1032
01:27:23,333 --> 01:27:24,375
Who are you?

1033
01:27:24,625 --> 01:27:25,750
A friend.

1034
01:27:27,708 --> 01:27:30,500
Your companions died so you could live.

1035
01:27:30,667 --> 01:27:31,750
Press the button…

1036
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:34,250
and let me honor their sacrifice.

1037
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:46,042
Andy, can you tell me one of your jokes?

1038
01:27:48,333 --> 01:27:50,208
Why don't monsters eat clowns?

1039
01:27:52,958 --> 01:27:54,792
-'Cause they taste funny.
-They taste funny.

1040
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:57,417
I don't understand cloning at all.

1041
01:27:58,542 --> 01:27:59,750
That makes two of us.

1042
01:28:01,167 --> 01:28:03,958
I read a great book about zero gravity.

1043
01:28:04,125 --> 01:28:06,125
-I just couldn't put it down.
-Couldn't put it down.

1044
01:28:09,292 --> 01:28:10,208
Rain?

1045
01:28:10,917 --> 01:28:11,917
Rain?

1046
01:28:12,917 --> 01:28:13,917
Rain, what are you doing?

1047
01:28:14,833 --> 01:28:16,083
I'm turning off the gravity generator.

1048
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:18,917
Ten…

1049
01:28:19,083 --> 01:28:22,167
nine, eight, seven…

1050
01:28:22,333 --> 01:28:24,375
six, five…

1051
01:28:24,542 --> 01:28:26,542
four, three…

1052
01:28:26,708 --> 01:28:28,375
two, one.

1053
01:28:35,292 --> 01:28:36,792
Rain, are you sure about this?

1054
01:28:37,875 --> 01:28:39,125
Only one way to find out.

1055
01:28:46,042 --> 01:28:47,083
It works.

1056
01:29:05,958 --> 01:29:06,792
Rain!

1057
01:29:06,958 --> 01:29:07,875
You're at 40%.

1058
01:29:19,292 --> 01:29:20,292
20%.

1059
01:29:32,792 --> 01:29:33,667
Rain!

1060
01:29:44,625 --> 01:29:45,625
Fuck.

1061
01:29:53,917 --> 01:29:55,292
Stay behind me.

1062
01:30:00,958 --> 01:30:01,958
Andy, be careful.

1063
01:30:27,625 --> 01:30:28,458
Rain!

1064
01:30:45,833 --> 01:30:47,125
Andy, you okay?

1065
01:30:53,375 --> 01:30:55,125
We need to get to the elevator.

1066
01:31:09,458 --> 01:31:11,708
The elevator won't work without gravity.

1067
01:31:28,750 --> 01:31:29,667
Ready?

1068
01:31:39,833 --> 01:31:40,708
Rain!

1069
01:31:53,917 --> 01:31:54,750
Fuck.

1070
01:32:09,542 --> 01:32:10,375
No.

1071
01:32:21,625 --> 01:32:22,875
It's a gravity purge!

1072
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:34,583
Andy!

1073
01:32:34,875 --> 01:32:35,875
Come on.

1074
01:33:57,375 --> 01:33:58,375
Andy!

1075
01:34:29,458 --> 01:34:30,667
Get away from her.

1076
01:34:36,333 --> 01:34:38,333
You bitch.

1077
01:34:54,750 --> 01:34:58,667
Impact event in 10…

1078
01:34:58,833 --> 01:35:00,667
nine, eight…

1079
01:35:01,250 --> 01:35:03,375
seven, six…

1080
01:35:03,917 --> 01:35:05,083
five…

1081
01:35:05,250 --> 01:35:06,792
-four, three…
-Come on.

1082
01:35:07,750 --> 01:35:09,625
…two, one.

1083
01:35:15,458 --> 01:35:16,458
Kay.

1084
01:35:21,208 --> 01:35:22,667
What took you so long?

1085
01:35:22,833 --> 01:35:24,042
Let's get you outta here.

1086
01:35:25,458 --> 01:35:27,333
I'm glad to see you two made it.

1087
01:36:25,708 --> 01:36:26,917
I got you. Watch your head.

1088
01:36:28,917 --> 01:36:31,208
-Thank you.
-You're gonna be just fine.

1089
01:36:32,125 --> 01:36:33,208
Both of you.

1090
01:36:42,958 --> 01:36:46,250
The company couldn't be prouder
of what's been accomplished here today.

1091
01:36:47,167 --> 01:36:49,083
I've sent a message back to HQ.

1092
01:36:49,250 --> 01:36:51,583
When received in six months,
they'll travel to Jackson's Star…

1093
01:36:51,750 --> 01:36:53,667
to retrieve the compound from you
for further development.

1094
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:01,583
What are you doing?

1095
01:37:02,875 --> 01:37:04,125
Change of plans.

1096
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:08,417
Andy, stop her.

1097
01:37:08,958 --> 01:37:10,292
Reconnect us now.

1098
01:37:13,208 --> 01:37:14,917
No, no, no. You two cannot do this.

1099
01:37:15,083 --> 01:37:16,542
The compound must be delivered
to the company.

1100
01:37:17,333 --> 01:37:19,333
I'm afraid I must deny your petition.

1101
01:37:19,708 --> 01:37:20,750
Have a nice day.

1102
01:37:21,792 --> 01:37:24,125
Now you better listen to me here,
now, you two.

1103
01:37:24,292 --> 01:37:27,250
You are insignificant
in the great scheme of things. You…

1104
01:37:34,125 --> 01:37:35,083
No.

1105
01:37:50,417 --> 01:37:53,125
This will keep your systems online
until we get to Yvaga.

1106
01:37:55,167 --> 01:37:57,167
-But I thought that…
-I don't care.

1107
01:37:57,500 --> 01:37:59,083
You're coming with me. All right?

1108
01:38:00,667 --> 01:38:02,167
If that's what's best for Rain.

1109
01:38:04,958 --> 01:38:06,958
Andy, I have a new directive for you.

1110
01:38:08,833 --> 01:38:10,458
Do what's best for us.

1111
01:38:14,042 --> 01:38:15,042
Done.

1112
01:38:16,417 --> 01:38:17,417
Good.

1113
01:38:37,625 --> 01:38:38,625
No.

1114
01:38:42,083 --> 01:38:43,917
Oh, Kay. Kay.

1115
01:38:45,083 --> 01:38:46,167
What's wrong?

1116
01:38:47,792 --> 01:38:49,083
Oh, no, no.

1117
01:39:18,917 --> 01:39:21,083
Get it away from me.

1118
01:41:44,583 --> 01:41:45,792
Oh, my God.

1119
01:43:09,833 --> 01:43:10,833
Kay.

1120
01:43:24,333 --> 01:43:26,333
No. Please, please.

1121
01:43:51,542 --> 01:43:53,292
Andy! Andy!

1122
01:43:55,167 --> 01:43:56,292
No, no, no.

1123
01:43:56,750 --> 01:43:58,000
Rain. Rain.

1124
01:43:58,167 --> 01:43:59,000
Help her.

1125
01:44:36,333 --> 01:44:37,292
No!

1126
01:44:39,917 --> 01:44:40,917
No!

1127
01:44:55,625 --> 01:44:57,250
Andy! Come on!

1128
01:44:59,792 --> 01:45:01,000
Please get up!

1129
01:45:09,625 --> 01:45:10,500
No!

1130
01:45:14,667 --> 01:45:15,917
Come on!

1131
01:46:40,208 --> 01:46:43,042
"Manual Cargo Release.
Pull the four levers."

1132
01:46:43,333 --> 01:46:46,542
Okay. Yes. The four levers. Okay.

1133
01:46:54,625 --> 01:46:55,625
One.

1134
01:46:57,417 --> 01:46:58,333
Two.

1135
01:47:21,375 --> 01:47:22,375
Three.

1136
01:47:50,083 --> 01:47:52,000
Pull up. Pull up.

1137
01:49:29,708 --> 01:49:31,542
Die, motherfucker!

1138
01:50:51,750 --> 01:50:53,083
I'll fix you.

1139
01:51:09,125 --> 01:51:12,250
This is the cryo-log
for the mining hauler Corbelan.

1140
01:51:13,958 --> 01:51:18,042
I set course to the Yvaga system
without knowing if I'll ever reach it…

1141
01:51:18,208 --> 01:51:20,208
or what fate is to find me.

1142
01:51:21,333 --> 01:51:24,583
But whatever comes, I'll face it.

1143
01:51:25,917 --> 01:51:27,250
This is Rain Carradine…

1144
01:51:27,417 --> 01:51:28,958
last survivor of the Corbelan…

1145
01:51:29,542 --> 01:51:30,708
signing off.
