1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000

3
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,417
Okay. How about...

4
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,250
a rocket dog with space chips?

5
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,458
Spaghetti with meteors?

6
00:01:18,417 --> 00:01:20,125
Galactic grape cup?

7
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:24,667
Elio, you have to eat something.

8
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:28,292
You remember what your mom
used to order for you?

9
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,417
Major Solís, what are you doing here?

10
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,583
Hey! Yeah, I'm with my nephew.

11
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:39,417
I'm trying to get him to eat.

12
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,542
Oh, right. Your nephew.

13
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:47,208
I heard about your brother and his wife.
I'm so sorry.

14
00:01:47,292 --> 00:01:48,292
Thank you.

15
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,708
We're managing.

16
00:01:50,792 --> 00:01:53,333
What about the astronaut program?
Weren't you about...

17
00:01:53,417 --> 00:01:55,042
No. Not anymore.

18
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:57,708
The timing just isn't right.

19
00:01:57,792 --> 00:01:58,792
Of course.

20
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:02,792
But it's been great spending time
with my new roommate.

21
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:03,875
Right, buddy?

22
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:05,792
Oh, no.

23
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,667
Hello from the children of Planet Earth.

24
00:02:59,917 --> 00:03:01,583
Since the dawn of time,

25
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:04,708
humans have gazed at the stars
and wondered...

26
00:03:05,292 --> 00:03:06,750
are we alone?

27
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,250
Voyager is our attempt to find out.

28
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:14,125
This intrepid explorer is on a mission,

29
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:17,875
traveling farther than any human
has ever gone,

30
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:21,875
to the distant reaches of the cosmos
and beyond.

31
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:26,958
Voyager will never see those
who made it again.

32
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:31,083
It will drift on, solitary and alone.

33
00:03:31,917 --> 00:03:33,667
But maybe one day,

34
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,500
distant worlds will receive its message

35
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,125
and Voyager will complete its mission,

36
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:42,542
proving we aren't so alone after all.

37
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,792
Elio! Elio!

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,375
Elio...

39
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,875
Are you hurt? What happened?

40
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,083
What happened?

41
00:03:57,167 --> 00:03:59,250
Is life really out there, Tía Olga?

42
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,333
What?

43
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:02,833
Come on.

44
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,542
You can't run away like that, Elio.

45
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,083
I should like to extend the greetings of
the government and the people of Canada.

46
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,583
Hello from the children of Planet Earth.

47
00:05:28,917 --> 00:05:29,917
Oh, wait.

48
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:38,208
Okay.

49
00:06:04,917 --> 00:06:05,917
Elio!

50
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:12,958
Hey.

51
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:16,667
Are you Elio?

52
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,375
Who wants to know?

53
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:21,333
You put flyers up for a Ham radio club?

54
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:24,250
I am Elio Solís,

55
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:27,542
president and leader of the Ham Radio Club

56
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,417
of this beach.

57
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,667
Cool. I'm Bryce.

58
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,458
Great, cool, awesome. Did you bring it?

59
00:07:33,042 --> 00:07:36,250
Oh, yeah. It's my dad's ham radio,
but I have my own call sign.

60
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,917
It's PXLOL,

61
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,750
which sometimes
makes people I talk to laugh.

62
00:07:41,292 --> 00:07:42,375
How far have you called?

63
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,917
On Friday I talked to...

64
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:46,917
Ohio.

65
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:51,167
If I can pair these together,
I can double their reach.

66
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,625
Okay, you can go now.

67
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,208
Go? Wait.

68
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:55,583
Where's everyone else?

69
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:59,125
Unfortunately, most of our members
came down with...

70
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,167
amnesia and forgot to come,

71
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,958
but I'll see you at the next meetup
in three months!

72
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:04,375
-What's up, Bryce?
-Hey.

73
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,375
One, two...

74
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,417
You almost messed up there.

75
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,500
Hey.

76
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,167
Oh, yeah.

77
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,750
-Swoosh!
-Nice.

78
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,917
This is Caleb. He wanted to come too.

79
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:19,875
Hey. What's with the hat?

80
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,583
Like I said, the meetup's been postponed.
Shingles is no joke.

81
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:26,167
I thought it was amnesia.

82
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,250
Oh, my gosh, you're right. It's spreading.

83
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,458
-You better go before you catch it. Bye!
-Yo, what's up with this guy?

84
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:31,750
Dude, chill.

85
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,042
He's the kid whose parents died.

86
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,625
Hey, that's classified information.

87
00:08:34,707 --> 00:08:37,042
As leader of this radio club, I hereby...

88
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,375
Did you do that?

89
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:42,082
No.

90
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:43,875
-Is this supposed to happen?
-Don't. Stop it!

91
00:08:44,542 --> 00:08:46,208
Hello? Hello? Can you hear me?

92
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:47,542
-Let me see that.
-Don't touch that.

93
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:50,083
-I was just looking at it.
-I have to respond.

94
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:51,000
-Let go!
-Quit it.

95
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,167
No!

96
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,500
Yo, that was not my fault.

97
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,083
I didn't mean to...

98
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:00,625
Oh, come on.

99
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,958
You suborbital, gaseous...

100
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,583
waste of mass!

101
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:07,042
Activate supernova blast!

102
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,250
Get off of me, you freak.

103
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,375
-Come on, guys, stop!
-He bit me!

104
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,958
Hey, what are you doing?

105
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,625
Unbelievable!

106
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:20,458
Fighting on the beach, skipping school?

107
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:22,667
Am I going to have to put
a tracker on you?

108
00:09:23,167 --> 00:09:24,167
Now your eye.

109
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:28,417
The doctor said not to touch it
for two weeks.

110
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,708
Elio!

111
00:09:29,792 --> 00:09:30,875
You meant starting now.

112
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,500
This is serious! What were you thinking?

113
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:36,083
I was minding my own business,
taking in the night air

114
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:38,958
-and suddenly these ruffians attacked me.
-No, no, no.

115
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:42,000
Look at me in the eye and for once,
tell me the truth.

116
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,167
No. I'm not learning Elioese.

117
00:09:49,917 --> 00:09:50,875
Major Solís.

118
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,458
You going to the seminar tonight?

119
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:55,458
There'll be a speaker from
the Astronaut Selection Program.

120
00:09:56,542 --> 00:09:57,875
No. No, no.

121
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,208
Something came up.

122
00:09:59,292 --> 00:10:02,083
Oh, is this the nephew
we've heard so much about?

123
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:03,250
Yes, that's him.

124
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,708
-Gloodle!
-Stop it!

125
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:09,292
I don't know if this is boundary testing,
or sleep regression, or...

126
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,000
Which one of these is you?

127
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:16,000
I don't know, but I think that one is you.

128
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:20,917
Okay, I've got one last meeting.

129
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,875
So, I need you to sit here

130
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,583
and not move or speak

131
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:27,125
or injure yourself for 10 minutes.

132
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,958
I have enough to deal with already.

133
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,292
What's with this emergency meeting?

134
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,500
Oh, you didn't hear?

135
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,833
Melmac thinks he found aliens.

136
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,000
This ought to be good.

137
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,708
All right, Mr. Melmac, let's hear it.

138
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,333
Major...

139
00:10:53,042 --> 00:10:54,542
Major Solís, earlier today,

140
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:57,625
I found this signal
coming from interstellar space.

141
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:09,917
Melmac, please.

142
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,500
-It's late...
-Wait, wait, wait.

143
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,125
Listen closely.

144
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,042
Hello, Planet Earth.

145
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,417
Hello, Planet Earth.

146
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,500
In 1977, NASA launched the...

147
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,083
-The Golden Record.
-The Golden Record! Yes.

148
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:26,208
-The what?
-The Golden Record, sir,

149
00:11:26,292 --> 00:11:27,792
was Earth's message in a bottle.

150
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,458
Hello from the children of Planet Earth.

151
00:11:30,542 --> 00:11:31,458
Don't you see?

152
00:11:31,542 --> 00:11:32,958
Hello, Planet Earth.

153
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:36,000
I think someone in interstellar space
found our message

154
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,250
and is sending it back to us as a reply!

155
00:11:39,042 --> 00:11:40,292
-Melmac...
-Major...

156
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,750
-Melmac...
-Major!

157
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,292
We can't just leave it like this,
we have to respond.

158
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:47,125
I've already rerouted every satellite
to send the signal back.

159
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,083
Sure, it might cause
a few system failures.

160
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,083
Whoop. Sorry.
Maybe a small electrical fire,

161
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:54,625
but it would be worth it
for first contact!

162
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:59,500
I have everything cued up and ready to go.
Just say the word!

163
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:03,292
If someone or something
is calling out to Earth,

164
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:06,667
who on Earth do you want taking that call?

165
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,875
You...

166
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:13,833
should go home.

167
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:15,708
-Take a week.
-Take two weeks.

168
00:12:15,792 --> 00:12:17,292
No. You got to believe me.

169
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,875
Major, please! They're out there!

170
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,125
Major!

171
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,083
Unhand me!

172
00:12:21,167 --> 00:12:24,500
May I remind everyone
that we are orbital analysts.

173
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:27,833
We track space debris,
not rogue UFO signals.

174
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,500
Let's just...

175
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,708
Let's just take five.

176
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:34,000
It's been a long night.

177
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,250
What a nutjob.

178
00:12:50,792 --> 00:12:54,125
This is Elio Solís of the planet Earth.

179
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,792
I come in peace...

180
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,583
and I'm super excited to join you.

181
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:01,750
I'm creative, hardworking...

182
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,417
shredded.

183
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,958
So please come and get me.
I'll be waiting.

184
00:13:06,042 --> 00:13:07,167
Okay, bye. Love you.

185
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:11,958
Yes.

186
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,292
Yes!

187
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:16,833
Yes!

188
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,083
Oh, no.

189
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:29,208
Time is of the essence. They could be here
any minute. I got to pack!

190
00:13:29,292 --> 00:13:32,875
I take full responsibility,
but, I mean, you have kids, right?

191
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,667
I'll be out of your way soon. Don't worry.

192
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,708
-Just need a few snacks for the road.
-Elio!

193
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:37,792
Sorry, ma'am. What was that?

194
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,125
Which will you miss the least? ¿Fuego?

195
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,458
-Fuego. Yeah.
-I understand.

196
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:42,458
Should I bring forks,
or would they think they're weapons?

197
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:44,333
Not worth the risk! I'll bring spoons.

198
00:13:44,417 --> 00:13:46,417
Nice, peaceful spoons.

199
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,083
-Where's my good cape?
-You too, ma'am.

200
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:49,750
-It's not in the wash, is it?
-Thank you.

201
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:51,542
-Here it is!
-Elio...

202
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,792
Blue or green?
Which one says, "Take me with you,"

203
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:54,875
but not in a desperate way?

204
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,292
Elio, stop! Please!

205
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:01,458
Aliens are not coming for you.

206
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:02,625
But that guy said...

207
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,792
You're out of control. You got in a fight.

208
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,083
You shut down power to the whole base

209
00:14:07,167 --> 00:14:09,083
and I almost lost my job!

210
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,917
We have to try something different.

211
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,292
Boarding school?
You're trying to get rid of me.

212
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:20,667
No, this is just their sleepaway camp.
It's just a couple of weeks.

213
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,917
I can't go. They're coming tonight.

214
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,875
You need to make friends or just a friend.

215
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,167
I don't care about friends.
I need to meet aliens.

216
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,250
Why?

217
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:31,000
Because there's 500 million
habitable planets out there

218
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:34,292
and one of them's got to want me!
Because obviously you don't!

219
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,250
Of course, I do! We're family!

220
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,958
You're not my family!

221
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,417
Your life isn't up there, Elio.

222
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,958
It's down here.

223
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:14,458
I can't deal with this.

224
00:15:14,542 --> 00:15:16,833
I don't know if anybody
can deal with this.

225
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,458
When I drop him off tomorrow,

226
00:15:20,542 --> 00:15:22,583
I'm going to see if they can enroll him
in the fall.

227
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,750
I know,

228
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:29,667
but this just isn't
how I thought my life would be.

229
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:35,875
It's an ancient human theme.

230
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,125
You can find it
in virtually every culture,

231
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,625
in religion, folklore, superstition

232
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,083
and now in science.

233
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:46,750
The search for life elsewhere
is remarkable in our age,

234
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:49,583
because this is the first time
that we can actually do something

235
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:51,083
besides speculation.

236
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,958
We can send spacecraft to nearby planets.

237
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:57,417
We can use large radio telescopes

238
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,125
to see if there is any message
being sent to us lately...

239
00:16:02,042 --> 00:16:05,375
and it touches to the deepest
of human concerns.

240
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:07,833
Are we alone?

241
00:16:28,542 --> 00:16:30,125
No contact! No contact!

242
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:33,875
You know I went here too,
when I was a kid.

243
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,625
You might not believe me right now...

244
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,375
but this will be good for you.

245
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,458
-Counselor Truman, could I have a word?
-Of course, Major.

246
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:57,958
We got in so much trouble...

247
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,292
because of you.

248
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,042
Yeah. Thanks a lot.

249
00:17:02,917 --> 00:17:04,791
-Better watch your back.
-Yeah.

250
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,833
He's going to be so freaked out!

251
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:21,583
Follow my lead.

252
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,708
Quiet. Quiet.

253
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,875
We're not going to hurt him, right?
Just scare him a little?

254
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:27,958
Come on, it'll be funny.

255
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:32,750
Shut up! You'll wake him up. Come on.

256
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,167
Quiet, quiet!

257
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,583
Greetings, Earthling.

258
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:40,417
We come in peace!

259
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:42,708
Where did he go?

260
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:52,125
Athena 5, there is a decommissioned
satellite headed your way.

261
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm calculating a new flight path for you.
Standby.

262
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:56,542
Go ahead, Montez.

263
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,958
Minus 53, plus 32, roll seven.

264
00:17:59,042 --> 00:18:00,417
Yeah, copy that.

265
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,083
Sorry about the scare.

266
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:05,208
There's been a lot
of satellite interference today.

267
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,542
Roger that. Athena 5, over and out.

268
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,458
Elio!

269
00:18:52,542 --> 00:18:55,125
-Come out, come out, wherever you are!
-Elio!

270
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,792
-Don't you want to hang out with us?
-I thought you wanted to meet some aliens.

271
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,250
Come on, it'll be fun.

272
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:03,708
He's out here somewhere.

273
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,958
Come on, Space Boy!
We know you're out there.

274
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,750
Gotcha!

275
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,000
You found me.

276
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,083
This is payback.

277
00:19:57,167 --> 00:19:59,458
It's okay. You don't need to pay me back.

278
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:01,708
Wait. What is that?

279
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,208
Hope you like how it tastes.

280
00:20:04,292 --> 00:20:05,458
There's something back there.

281
00:20:05,542 --> 00:20:06,542
Look!

282
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:09,792
You're so dead, Solís.

283
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,208
Hey, hold on.

284
00:20:12,042 --> 00:20:13,042
Wait.

285
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:07,917
Please.

286
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:15,042
Yes!

287
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,625
Yes!

288
00:21:17,792 --> 00:21:20,250
It's happening! It's really happening.

289
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,542
I knew it! I knew it!

290
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,417
Yes!

291
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,250
Yes, yes, yes!

292
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,167
Thank you!

293
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,833
Yes! Yeah!

294
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:05,458
Hi.

295
00:22:07,167 --> 00:22:11,417
I knew it! I knew aliens were looking
for me. You saved my life!

296
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,792
I promise I'll pull my weight
on this spaceship?

297
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,500
Is this a spaceship?
Anyway, where should we start?

298
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:18,667
Probes? Samples?

299
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,000
I've got plenty.

300
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,833
Testing, testing, testing.

301
00:22:26,917 --> 00:22:28,667
Can you understand me now?

302
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,917
Yes. Wow.

303
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,250
It is a pleasure to meet you.

304
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:34,958
I am Ooooo, a liquid supercomputer.

305
00:22:35,042 --> 00:22:36,625
Allow me to adjust your gravity.

306
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,583
-Oh, no, no, no. I'm fine.
-Gravity on.

307
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:45,375
A welcome glass of glorp,
compliments of the Communiverse.

308
00:22:46,167 --> 00:22:47,458
Thank you.

309
00:22:47,542 --> 00:22:48,917
Wait. The what?

310
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:07,292
Welcome to the Communiverse,

311
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:10,625
a pangalactic organization
of the advanced species of the cosmos.

312
00:23:11,667 --> 00:23:15,542
The greatest minds of the universe come
here to share knowledge, innovation...

313
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:17,375
And recipes!

314
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:18,292
Welcome!

315
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:19,583
-Welcome!
-Lovely.

316
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:21,542
Greetings, Ambassadors!

317
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:24,750
Absolutely ecstatic
to make your acquaintance.

318
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:28,417
You've run dry.
Let me top you off, old brick.

319
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:30,125
Thank you.

320
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:33,667
Yes. One cerebellum, four lobes...

321
00:23:34,542 --> 00:23:36,042
and a medulla.

322
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:38,333
Do you mind if I take a little peek inside
and see?

323
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,375
Questa, don't mindread him,
you've just met him.

324
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:43,167
So sorry about that.

325
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,833
I am Questa of Gom.

326
00:23:45,917 --> 00:23:48,250
Helix of Falluvinum.

327
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:49,625
Tegmen of Tegmeg.

328
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:51,042
And you are?

329
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:56,333
Elio Solís of, uh... Earth!

330
00:23:56,417 --> 00:24:00,667
A toast to our new candidate,
Elio Solís of Uh-Earth.

331
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,167
-There he is!
-Elio Solís!

332
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,417
Look, it's Elio!

333
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,625
It's a new candidate!

334
00:24:07,167 --> 00:24:08,583
Salutations!

335
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:09,667
I love your eye!

336
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,958
We search the universe
for like-minded souls and new species

337
00:24:15,042 --> 00:24:19,333
and we think you're an excellent candidate
for Communiverse membership.

338
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,833
You mean I could stay here?

339
00:24:21,917 --> 00:24:24,750
If all the members agree, then, yes.

340
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:29,708
You'll be one of us and be
the proud bearer of one of these.

341
00:24:29,792 --> 00:24:33,000
Now come, everyone's eager to meet you.

342
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:43,583
Each of us brings our specialized
knowledge and interest to share.

343
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:44,750
Greetings, Naos!

344
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:46,167
Hello. Salutations.

345
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:50,750
Naos, here, created the Communidiscs
we all use with controls for gravity...

346
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:54,333
temperature...

347
00:24:55,292 --> 00:24:57,625
and all known languages.

348
00:24:57,708 --> 00:24:59,708
You know Elioese?

349
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,250
-Gloodle!
-Gloodle!

350
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:08,333
Gloodle!

351
00:25:08,417 --> 00:25:11,833
This is my most recent design. Try it.

352
00:25:11,917 --> 00:25:12,750
Hello.

353
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:15,500
I am the Universal Users Manual.

354
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:18,083
I contain the secrets of the universe.

355
00:25:18,167 --> 00:25:20,125
What is the meaning of life?

356
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:23,167
What lies beyond a black hole?
Is there a purpose to...

357
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,208
Who would win in a fight?

358
00:25:24,292 --> 00:25:26,750
One gorilla with a baseball bat
or ten chimps?

359
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:29,833
None who fight are true winners.

360
00:25:32,958 --> 00:25:33,958
The gorilla.

361
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,125
These little critters are mimollusks.

362
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:42,667
They use nanotechnology
to construct anything you desire.

363
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,917
Are you kidding me?

364
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,542
How dashing!

365
00:25:54,417 --> 00:25:57,792
This is the most beautiful place
I've ever seen.

366
00:25:57,875 --> 00:25:59,375
This is the bathroom.

367
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:04,958
Gets me every time.

368
00:26:05,042 --> 00:26:06,042
Bracing.

369
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:09,333
It's like I was always meant to be here.

370
00:26:09,917 --> 00:26:11,583
I knew you were looking for me.

371
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:13,542
Of course we were looking for you.

372
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:17,333
Ever since we picked up this
charming little spacecraft you sent us.

373
00:26:20,708 --> 00:26:21,792
Voyager?

374
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:23,750
We found it in an asteroid field.

375
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:25,292
Nice craftsmanship.

376
00:26:26,708 --> 00:26:27,708
Thanks?

377
00:26:32,542 --> 00:26:36,000
Curious about the species who made it,
we sent an invitation

378
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:39,542
and were delighted to receive
your planet's official reply.

379
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:44,917
This is Elio Solís of the planet Earth
and I'm super excited to join you.

380
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,833
I'm creative, hardworking, shredded.

381
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:51,667
So, please come and get me.
I'll be waiting. Okay, bye. Love you.

382
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,833
-Very touching.
-We are delighted

383
00:26:53,917 --> 00:26:56,042
to finally make your acquaintance,

384
00:26:56,125 --> 00:26:58,417
Leader of Uh-Earth.

385
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,833
Why is your face melting?

386
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:06,000
-Well...
-Ambassadors,

387
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:08,000
an urgent matter requires your attention.

388
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:09,708
It involves the other candidate.

389
00:27:09,792 --> 00:27:11,167
-Oh, him.
-Oh, dear.

390
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,583
We should hurry. Quickly now!

391
00:27:12,667 --> 00:27:13,667
Excuse us.

392
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,625
Please join us.

393
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:27,292
Your technology and my weapons
would be an unstoppable alliance.

394
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:29,917
Now, admit me to your Communiverse!

395
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:34,583
Unfortunately, Candidate Grigon,

396
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:36,875
it is our assessment that you are

397
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:38,042
not a fit.

398
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:40,208
I, Lord Grigon,

399
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:44,708
Blood Emperor of Hylurg, not a fit?

400
00:27:45,458 --> 00:27:49,167
Well, we believe in tolerance
and open-mindedness...

401
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,583
I am tolerant!

402
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:54,208
So sorry, it's not you.

403
00:27:54,292 --> 00:27:55,917
It's us.

404
00:27:57,292 --> 00:27:59,458
I thought we said it was him.

405
00:27:59,542 --> 00:28:02,417
If I cannot join the Communiverse,

406
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,417
then I shall take it by force!

407
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,542
Prepare to be conquered!

408
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:12,250
What a brute!

409
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:13,583
Why did he make a new hole?

410
00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:15,208
I suggest we run and hide.

411
00:28:15,292 --> 00:28:18,250
Yes, let's go to the edge of the cosmos
and turn off all the lights.

412
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:21,000
That includes me, right?

413
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:23,208
Oh, so sorry, candidate Solís,

414
00:28:23,292 --> 00:28:27,625
we couldn't possibly accept new members
under the current situation.

415
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:29,667
Applications are closed indefinitely.

416
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,417
-But I just got here!
-Such a shame.

417
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,125
Let's check back in a few thousand years?

418
00:28:34,208 --> 00:28:35,875
Perhaps one of us
could talk to Lord Grigon.

419
00:28:35,958 --> 00:28:36,958
-You do it!
-Not me.

420
00:28:37,042 --> 00:28:38,833
-I am shy.
-I'm busy.

421
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,667
-I have allergies.
-My battery is low.

422
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:44,417
Don't worry. I'll return you to your life
on Uh-Earth just as it was.

423
00:28:45,708 --> 00:28:47,458
Just as it was.

424
00:28:49,458 --> 00:28:50,750
No, no!

425
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:53,083
I'll do it.

426
00:28:55,542 --> 00:28:56,875
I'm the leader of Earth.

427
00:28:57,417 --> 00:28:59,333
I'm the perfect guy for the job.

428
00:29:00,042 --> 00:29:01,125
What did it say?

429
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:02,583
-How curious.
-I do not understand.

430
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:04,875
-You would talk to Lord Grigon?
-But what would you say?

431
00:29:04,958 --> 00:29:07,542
Are you an expert on conflict negotiation?

432
00:29:08,208 --> 00:29:11,583
You kidding?
My life is nothing but conflict...

433
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:14,458
and I've got the battle scars to prove it.

434
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:18,417
It would be a welcome change

435
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,833
not to flee every bully
who covets our treasures.

436
00:29:24,708 --> 00:29:25,917
Yes. What's in it for you?

437
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,875
Why would you agree
to such a dangerous mission?

438
00:29:29,542 --> 00:29:30,542
Because...

439
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:32,083
you need me.

440
00:29:32,917 --> 00:29:36,792
And at my age
it's really about giving back.

441
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:41,375
If you can make Grigon go away,
we'd make you a member on the spot.

442
00:29:42,417 --> 00:29:45,792
Then I, the leader of Earth,
am ready to serve.

443
00:29:45,875 --> 00:29:47,083
-Good. Very good.
-How impressive!

444
00:29:47,167 --> 00:29:49,125
-What courage!
-Wonderful!

445
00:29:49,208 --> 00:29:52,333
Candidate Solís, you continue to surprise.

446
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:55,750
When Grigon returns,
we shall be ready for him.

447
00:29:55,833 --> 00:29:58,375
Until then, as you say on Uh-Earth.

448
00:29:58,458 --> 00:30:00,500
Okay, bye. I love you.

449
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:02,917
Okay. Bye. I love you.

450
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,667
Don't worry. I got this.

451
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,458
You're in great hands.

452
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,167
Just one last order of business.

453
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,875
Oh, yeah, of course.

454
00:30:14,083 --> 00:30:18,083
While you negotiate with the warlord,
you'll need a temporary replacement.

455
00:30:18,167 --> 00:30:20,125
Can I trouble you for a DNA sample?

456
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:21,208
Sure. Where do you want it...?

457
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:32,583
Wow. My first probe.

458
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:37,083
World leaders, such as yourself,
can't just disappear.

459
00:30:37,167 --> 00:30:39,417
Your planet would descend into chaos.

460
00:30:40,542 --> 00:30:42,792
That's what cloning clay is for.

461
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:07,833
Is this...?

462
00:31:07,917 --> 00:31:09,417
Are you...?

463
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,500
Me?

464
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:12,250
Rock...

465
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:13,250
Paper...

466
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:14,333
Black hole!

467
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:17,375
-Space is the best!
-Space is amazing!

468
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:22,708
In you go.

469
00:31:22,792 --> 00:31:23,875
Sorry.

470
00:31:23,958 --> 00:31:25,083
It's a living.

471
00:31:25,167 --> 00:31:26,792
So, what is my motivation?

472
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:27,958
What do you mean?

473
00:31:28,042 --> 00:31:29,625
Should I change anything

474
00:31:29,708 --> 00:31:32,333
or just stick with the low self-esteem
and desperation to belong?

475
00:31:32,417 --> 00:31:35,583
What? I'm normal, just be normal.

476
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:37,000
No weird stuff, okay?

477
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:38,708
-Okay.
-Okay.

478
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:47,125
Have fun.

479
00:31:47,792 --> 00:31:51,042
Intriguing Uh-Earth custom.
The warlord awaits.

480
00:31:51,958 --> 00:31:54,917
There was just a few things
I wanted to brush up on.

481
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,625
Where was that thing that knew
everything about everything?

482
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:57,708
You mean this?

483
00:31:57,792 --> 00:32:00,875
Hello. I am the Universal Users Manual.

484
00:32:00,958 --> 00:32:03,833
Would you like to learn
the meaning of life now? It's a...

485
00:32:03,917 --> 00:32:06,625
No. I need everything you've got
on how to negotiate with the warmonger.

486
00:32:08,208 --> 00:32:09,542
Certainly.

487
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:12,458
-I have chapters on leading with empathy.
-Nope.

488
00:32:12,542 --> 00:32:13,958
-Fostering connection?
-Nope.

489
00:32:14,042 --> 00:32:15,583
Making the killer deal?

490
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,375
Yes, that one. Do you have a pen?

491
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,292
In the increasingly likely event
that you will die,

492
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:23,333
would you like to notify
your next of kin on Uh-Earth?

493
00:32:23,417 --> 00:32:24,542
No, that's okay.

494
00:32:24,625 --> 00:32:26,875
Start from a position of power.

495
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:30,542
The most important thing is to stay calm.

496
00:32:30,625 --> 00:32:32,458
Don't you tell me to stay calm!

497
00:32:32,542 --> 00:32:34,625
What is this, huh? A camp or a fight club?

498
00:32:34,708 --> 00:32:36,583
He's an innocent little boy

499
00:32:36,667 --> 00:32:39,625
and if this is what you call
building character,

500
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:42,167
then I'll take it up with your boss,

501
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:45,000
or her boss. Everyone's boss!

502
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:46,375
Unacceptable!

503
00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:51,917
I never should have left you here.

504
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,333
Yeah, they chased me
because I'm weak and small,

505
00:32:54,417 --> 00:32:57,583
but there was pizza for dinner.
So, overall, a pretty good night.

506
00:32:57,667 --> 00:32:59,333
How's the eye? Swollen?

507
00:32:59,417 --> 00:33:00,542
-Did they hurt it?
-It's fine.

508
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:02,458
I'm so sorry I didn't check in.

509
00:33:02,542 --> 00:33:05,375
-Something weird was happening.
-That's okay.

510
00:33:05,458 --> 00:33:08,417
I was tracking this crazy signal
from space...

511
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,208
Are we going home? What's for dinner?

512
00:33:12,208 --> 00:33:13,458
Mac and cheese.

513
00:33:13,542 --> 00:33:18,417
I just thought you'd be interested because
if aliens were calling from space...

514
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,125
Early morning fog and clouds
along the coast...

515
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:22,125
Elio?

516
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,792
Are we doing regular or white cheddar?
I'm starved.

517
00:33:24,875 --> 00:33:26,833
So, you don't want to talk about aliens?

518
00:33:26,917 --> 00:33:29,625
Not really. I thought it'd be better
if I just dropped it.

519
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,375
Really?

520
00:33:32,417 --> 00:33:34,500
That's... amazing.

521
00:33:35,458 --> 00:33:36,458
Good for you.

522
00:33:39,708 --> 00:33:40,708
I love this song.

523
00:33:51,292 --> 00:33:52,333
Do you see him?

524
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:55,417
Yes, and he's brought his...

525
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:57,417
compatriots.

526
00:33:57,917 --> 00:33:58,917
Jolly good.

527
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,417
Okay. Be confident.
Speak from a position of power.

528
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,708
He's here!

529
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,708
He's here. There he is.

530
00:34:05,792 --> 00:34:07,167
The man of the hour.

531
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,542
Sorry I'm late.

532
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:11,250
So, is Lord Grigon coming here?

533
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:13,833
Oh, no. You will be going out there.

534
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:16,958
Okay, bye. Love you.

535
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:20,583
What is this?

536
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,667
Red? Green?

537
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:24,292
Welcome, Captain Solís.

538
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:26,083
You have selected
a map of our coordinates.

539
00:34:26,167 --> 00:34:29,375
Cabin pressure. Shield function.
A nutritious shake. A breath mint.

540
00:34:29,458 --> 00:34:30,583
A bladder evacuation module.

541
00:34:30,667 --> 00:34:32,500
He found the mint.

542
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:36,458
You have set our destination
to your home planet.

543
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:38,083
Uh-Earth.

544
00:34:38,167 --> 00:34:39,750
Confirm or cancel?

545
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:44,792
Good luck.

546
00:34:48,833 --> 00:34:49,833
Cancel.

547
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,250
Okay, okay.

548
00:35:03,333 --> 00:35:04,292
A little to the left.

549
00:35:04,375 --> 00:35:06,542
Get your nubs at ten and two.

550
00:35:11,167 --> 00:35:13,333
What a heroic figure he cuts.

551
00:35:43,042 --> 00:35:46,625
Hi. Take me to your leader?

552
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:56,042
Okay, look him in the eye.
Stand your ground.

553
00:35:56,583 --> 00:35:58,875
You're the alpha, you're the killer.
You're...

554
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:08,375
This is who the Communiverse sends?

555
00:36:11,292 --> 00:36:14,125
You are more puny than I expected.

556
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,208
I could say the same about you.

557
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:18,958
What?

558
00:36:19,042 --> 00:36:21,625
What do you need
to leave the Communiverse alone?

559
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:25,750
Hylurgians prefer to negotiate
with screams in the air.

560
00:36:28,167 --> 00:36:29,250
Pull!

561
00:36:39,042 --> 00:36:41,167
Recoil's a little heavy.

562
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:44,083
Your turn.

563
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,625
Darn! I left my arm cannon at home.

564
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:50,833
Why don't we...?

565
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:54,625
Use one of mine.

566
00:36:54,708 --> 00:36:56,250
So nice of you.

567
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:02,083
I mean, we're both leaders and...

568
00:37:02,167 --> 00:37:03,500
Pull!

569
00:37:05,292 --> 00:37:08,458
Surely we could find something
to everyone's mutual...

570
00:37:10,833 --> 00:37:11,833
benefit.

571
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:13,625
Trick shot.

572
00:37:13,708 --> 00:37:17,542
Perhaps we are able to communicate...
Pull!

573
00:37:17,625 --> 00:37:20,208
But those Communiverse weaklings

574
00:37:20,292 --> 00:37:22,958
look at me like some kind of monster.

575
00:37:23,042 --> 00:37:24,667
How dare they reject me!

576
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,917
Well, if they don't want you,

577
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:32,917
why not find someone who does?

578
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,583
Come again?

579
00:37:34,667 --> 00:37:36,292
There's got to be a place out there

580
00:37:36,375 --> 00:37:40,208
that would love to have
a strong guy like you.

581
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:44,083
But is the Communiverse
not where the greatest leaders gather?

582
00:37:44,625 --> 00:37:46,000
Am I not great?

583
00:37:46,083 --> 00:37:47,167
Totally.

584
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:51,250
But why waste your life trying to connect
with people who don't get you?

585
00:37:51,833 --> 00:37:53,292
It's time to move on.

586
00:37:53,375 --> 00:37:55,458
Right, Gri-guy?

587
00:37:56,083 --> 00:37:57,083
Gri-guy?

588
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:01,000
Yes. What, Workko, what is it?

589
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:03,458
Your Wrath,
the princeling wants to see you.

590
00:38:03,542 --> 00:38:06,958
For the hate of the... Tell him I am busy!

591
00:38:07,042 --> 00:38:10,292
So, as we were saying,
forget the Communiverse...

592
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:11,792
You are a father, right?

593
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,083
Yeah.

594
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:15,750
It is so difficult!

595
00:38:15,833 --> 00:38:19,583
He has no concept
of the importance of my work.

596
00:38:19,667 --> 00:38:23,625
I get it. If he's too hard to handle,
then just ship him off.

597
00:38:23,708 --> 00:38:25,417
That's what I did with mine. So...

598
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,833
"Too hard to handle"?

599
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:32,625
I mean...

600
00:38:32,708 --> 00:38:35,042
You think I cannot handle my own son?

601
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:36,750
No, no, no. I don't think that...

602
00:38:36,833 --> 00:38:39,375
No! Really. Tell me what I am doing wrong!

603
00:38:40,042 --> 00:38:42,083
It's okay. I'm a bad parent too.

604
00:38:42,167 --> 00:38:44,500
-What?
-None of us know what we're doing.

605
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:46,917
We didn't even want this, right?

606
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,500
Let me remind you
who you are dealing with!

607
00:38:49,583 --> 00:38:53,625
I am Grigon, Blood Emperor of Hylurg...

608
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:58,417
scourge of the Crab Nebula
and a great father!

609
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,750
Pull!

610
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:06,875
Right, why don't
we take a little breather...

611
00:39:06,958 --> 00:39:10,125
The negotiation is over. Gronk!

612
00:39:10,208 --> 00:39:12,500
Show the prisoner to his quarters!

613
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:13,875
Prisoner? What?

614
00:39:13,958 --> 00:39:18,792
You will watch from a cell
as I destroy your beloved Communiverse!

615
00:39:18,875 --> 00:39:20,292
No, no, wait!

616
00:39:23,583 --> 00:39:25,458
He's really turned over a new leaf.

617
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:28,792
-Hey, Elio.
-Hey, Jim. How's your back?

618
00:39:28,875 --> 00:39:31,125
-Oh, you know...
-I hear ya.

619
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:32,958
Camp must've really helped.

620
00:39:33,042 --> 00:39:34,417
I guess it did.

621
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,375
But he was only there for one day.

622
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:40,417
I overheard the colonel raving about you.

623
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,833
Really? She was?

624
00:39:41,917 --> 00:39:44,708
Yeah. You've been working really hard.

625
00:39:44,792 --> 00:39:48,542
That's so good to hear.
I thought I'd never get off her bad side.

626
00:39:49,583 --> 00:39:51,625
Everyone's super impressed.

627
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,208
Wait, please. You made a mistake.

628
00:39:58,292 --> 00:40:00,042
I'm the leader of Earth!

629
00:40:35,083 --> 00:40:37,792
Gravity... off.

630
00:40:48,417 --> 00:40:50,542
Okay, that's enough! Gravity back!

631
00:40:53,792 --> 00:40:57,208
Okay. I'll just get back to Grigon.
What haven't I tried?

632
00:40:58,083 --> 00:41:01,333
"Bargaining chip"?
Like, something valuable?

633
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:02,833
Where am I going to find...?

634
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,583
Hi, there.

635
00:41:35,542 --> 00:41:38,083
I'm too young to die.
I'm too young to die.

636
00:41:38,167 --> 00:41:39,917
I'm too young to die.

637
00:41:45,125 --> 00:41:47,458
What's happening? What's happening?

638
00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:50,500
Translator disc, cool.

639
00:41:50,583 --> 00:41:52,000
-Are you going to eat me?
-What?

640
00:41:52,667 --> 00:41:55,625
I was just swaddling you
because you seemed scared.

641
00:41:55,708 --> 00:41:57,792
That's what my mom does when I get scared.

642
00:41:57,875 --> 00:42:00,375
I'm rarely unswaddled.

643
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:02,000
You're just a little kid.

644
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:05,250
So? Don't have to be rude about it.

645
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:08,875
No, no, no. Hey, come back!

646
00:42:08,958 --> 00:42:10,333
I wasn't making fun of you!

647
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:13,583
My name's Elio.

648
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:15,333
What's your name?

649
00:42:15,417 --> 00:42:17,500
You really want to know my name?

650
00:42:17,583 --> 00:42:20,583
Well, I really want to get down.

651
00:42:20,667 --> 00:42:23,708
I'm Glordon! No one's ever
asked me my name before.

652
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,500
I mean, I ask a lot of questions
all the time.

653
00:42:26,583 --> 00:42:28,958
No one ever asks me
about questions about me, though.

654
00:42:29,042 --> 00:42:30,583
Like what my favorite color is.

655
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:32,917
It's purple, if you're asking.
Are you asking?

656
00:42:39,458 --> 00:42:42,042
What's wrong with you?
That's just my carapace.

657
00:42:42,125 --> 00:42:44,042
-What?
-I'll show you.

658
00:42:52,042 --> 00:42:53,625
Ta-da!

659
00:42:55,292 --> 00:42:57,875
Every Hylurgian gets one
when they come of age.

660
00:42:57,958 --> 00:43:00,333
It's got weapons and bombs and stuff.

661
00:43:00,417 --> 00:43:01,958
Ooh, and a cup holder!

662
00:43:02,042 --> 00:43:03,458
It's bespoke.

663
00:43:04,208 --> 00:43:07,708
So, if Hylurgians took off their armor,
they'd look like you?

664
00:43:07,792 --> 00:43:09,917
Yeah, but nobody would ever do that.

665
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,208
To expose your soft, warm flesh

666
00:43:12,292 --> 00:43:15,792
would dishonor you and your whole family
for all eternity.

667
00:43:15,875 --> 00:43:17,250
I can't wait to get installed.

668
00:43:17,792 --> 00:43:19,875
I'm going to look so hot.

669
00:43:19,958 --> 00:43:22,083
Alert! A prisoner has escaped.

670
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:24,208
-Oh, no.
-Are they talking about you?

671
00:43:24,292 --> 00:43:27,375
It's a complicated political situation.
You wouldn't understand.

672
00:43:27,458 --> 00:43:29,500
-Are you a treacherous dissident?
-Where is he?

673
00:43:29,583 --> 00:43:31,000
-Check every chamber!
-Are you an assassin?

674
00:43:31,083 --> 00:43:33,167
-You two with me. Move!
-What'd you do?

675
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:34,125
Yes, sir!

676
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:36,458
Come on,
I'm really good at keeping secrets.

677
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,833
-Nothing here, sir.
-Keep looking!

678
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:40,875
The secret is...

679
00:43:41,458 --> 00:43:42,542
I'm a kid.

680
00:43:42,625 --> 00:43:44,000
What? Really?

681
00:43:44,542 --> 00:43:45,958
Mm-hmm.

682
00:43:46,042 --> 00:43:49,833
And I kind of tricked the Communiverse
into thinking I was the leader of Earth.

683
00:43:49,917 --> 00:43:51,000
-What?
-Just leave them alone

684
00:43:51,083 --> 00:43:53,292
or else I'm going to be captured out of
the only place I've ever wanted to be.

685
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:56,042
No way! You're crazy.

686
00:43:56,125 --> 00:43:59,167
I know and now Grigon's
going to blow everyone up

687
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:01,375
unless I can find a bargaining chip.

688
00:44:01,458 --> 00:44:05,167
Something he values,
but what does he even value?

689
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:09,458
Well, Dad values blood, glory,
the misery of his enemies.

690
00:44:09,542 --> 00:44:10,625
-There was this one time...
-Hold up.

691
00:44:11,167 --> 00:44:12,750
Grigon's your dad?

692
00:44:12,833 --> 00:44:15,083
I thought you knew. I look just like him.

693
00:44:15,167 --> 00:44:16,167
Check it out.

694
00:44:22,208 --> 00:44:23,583
I've been working on my back.

695
00:44:26,792 --> 00:44:30,500
Can I ask you a big favor?

696
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,750
Sure.

697
00:44:32,833 --> 00:44:34,667
Bargaining chip. Cool.

698
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:36,917
I've never been a bargaining chip before.

699
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,792
I've been a liability. A disappointment.

700
00:44:38,875 --> 00:44:41,167
-A deduction.
-Are we almost to my ship?

701
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:44,375
Not far now.
I've also been a pillow, an enigma,

702
00:44:44,458 --> 00:44:46,208
a problem, a headache.

703
00:44:47,417 --> 00:44:48,708
Little help, please.

704
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:51,167
Lately, I've just been ignored,

705
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:53,875
but now my dad's finally
going to pay attention to me.

706
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:55,875
Do your parents pay attention to you?

707
00:44:55,958 --> 00:44:57,958
Well, my Aunt Olga doesn't care.

708
00:44:58,042 --> 00:45:01,500
With me out the way
she can do what she really wants.

709
00:45:02,458 --> 00:45:04,333
Like be an astronaut or whatever.

710
00:45:04,417 --> 00:45:07,500
She gave up being an astronaut
or whatever for you?

711
00:45:07,583 --> 00:45:09,292
Wow. She must really love you.

712
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:12,292
No, no, she doesn't.

713
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:15,167
But now I'm free to join the Communiverse,

714
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:17,083
which is where I belong anyway

715
00:45:17,167 --> 00:45:18,833
and that's where you come in,

716
00:45:18,917 --> 00:45:20,500
bargaining chip.

717
00:45:25,917 --> 00:45:28,167
Wiggle, wiggle.

718
00:45:28,708 --> 00:45:31,333
Candidate Solís? Sorry to bother you.

719
00:45:31,417 --> 00:45:33,917
It's just that the Hylurgian ships

720
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,292
seem to be pointing their cannons at us.

721
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:38,375
Is this part of the negotiations?

722
00:45:38,458 --> 00:45:40,917
Oh, that's just a drill. Don't worry.

723
00:45:41,875 --> 00:45:42,875
Wiggle.

724
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:47,833
Come on.

725
00:45:47,917 --> 00:45:49,333
What are these tunnels for, anyway?

726
00:45:49,417 --> 00:45:52,542
Oh, these are the lava flumes.
They power the cannons.

727
00:45:54,375 --> 00:45:56,375
Glordon, I am not fireproof!

728
00:45:56,458 --> 00:45:58,417
-Really? Why didn't you say something?
-Glordon!

729
00:45:59,125 --> 00:46:01,667
It's okay. Just get in my mouth.

730
00:46:02,542 --> 00:46:03,917
What? No way!

731
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,125
Trust me.

732
00:46:14,125 --> 00:46:16,458
It's actually kind of comfy in here.

733
00:46:16,542 --> 00:46:19,208
It is? I've never been in there. Hold on.

734
00:46:24,208 --> 00:46:25,583
Yeah!

735
00:46:29,583 --> 00:46:30,625
Refreshing.

736
00:46:32,542 --> 00:46:33,542
You okay?

737
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:35,917
Yes!

738
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,458
Lower me down.

739
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,167
Thanks, Glordon.

740
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:44,958
It's nothing. Up top.

741
00:46:47,458 --> 00:46:50,083
How long's the flight?
Any snacks on board?

742
00:46:54,292 --> 00:46:58,208
It's Candidate Solís!
I'm sure he's bringing good news.

743
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Look out!

744
00:47:06,667 --> 00:47:08,833
I'm so excited. I'm so excited.
I'm so excited.

745
00:47:08,917 --> 00:47:10,875
-Candidate Solís?
-What's happened?

746
00:47:10,958 --> 00:47:12,958
Ooooo, open a line to Lord Grigon!

747
00:47:13,042 --> 00:47:15,083
-Of course.
-Who is this?

748
00:47:15,167 --> 00:47:16,667
Who is responsible for...

749
00:47:17,583 --> 00:47:18,542
-You!
-Yes.

750
00:47:18,625 --> 00:47:21,042
It's me! The leader of Earth.

751
00:47:21,125 --> 00:47:25,000
And the negotiation is not over
because now I've got this!

752
00:47:25,083 --> 00:47:26,000
Oh, my.

753
00:47:26,083 --> 00:47:27,333
Glordon?

754
00:47:27,417 --> 00:47:31,833
Yes, and pretty soon he's
going to be Glor-done.

755
00:47:31,917 --> 00:47:33,833
Hi, Dad. I'm a bargaining chip.

756
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:35,708
No. Say the other thing.

757
00:47:35,792 --> 00:47:37,917
Help me, Father. He overpowered me.

758
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
He's too strong. Too shredded.

759
00:47:41,083 --> 00:47:42,333
Quiet, you!

760
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:46,875
What is that unholy sound? Stop! Stop!

761
00:47:46,958 --> 00:47:48,167
Only if you swear...

762
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:50,292
On your Hylurgian honor.

763
00:47:50,375 --> 00:47:51,917
On your Hylurgian honor

764
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,042
to leave the Communiverse in peace
and never return.

765
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:57,250
My Hylurgian honor?

766
00:47:57,333 --> 00:48:00,500
Do you know what you are asking? I will...

767
00:48:04,458 --> 00:48:06,208
Stop!

768
00:48:06,292 --> 00:48:08,083
I concede!

769
00:48:10,125 --> 00:48:13,125
I swear on my honor...

770
00:48:14,417 --> 00:48:16,708
You are full of surprises.

771
00:48:16,792 --> 00:48:18,000
You have my vow.

772
00:48:19,208 --> 00:48:21,708
I will come to collect my son,

773
00:48:21,792 --> 00:48:25,417
but if even one hair
on a single nub is harmed,

774
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:28,083
you will feel my wrath.

775
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:33,208
Well done. I knew you had it in you.

776
00:48:33,292 --> 00:48:34,375
Thank you.

777
00:48:34,458 --> 00:48:39,167
Oh, I can't wait for this all to be over,
and officially welcome you into the fold.

778
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,958
I'm customizing
your membership badge right now.

779
00:48:42,042 --> 00:48:43,250
Do you like the color?

780
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:45,333
It's beautiful.

781
00:48:45,417 --> 00:48:47,250
And so well-deserved.

782
00:48:47,333 --> 00:48:50,208
But first, let's prepare
for Lord Grigon's arrival.

783
00:48:50,292 --> 00:48:51,708
Come, everyone. Chop chop.

784
00:48:54,875 --> 00:48:58,667
You guys go ahead.
I'll take care of the bargaining chip.

785
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:02,458
Very good, Candidate Solís.
Now, does anyone know a good caterer?

786
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:06,417
Oh, we did it.

787
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:09,542
Yeah. You were so cool.

788
00:49:09,625 --> 00:49:11,167
Oh, you okay?

789
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:13,958
I've never been outside before.

790
00:49:14,042 --> 00:49:15,667
It's cold here.

791
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:21,083
Wow! This thing's amazing.

792
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:23,375
Watch this. Gravity off.

793
00:49:27,875 --> 00:49:29,458
Gravity off.

794
00:49:34,208 --> 00:49:36,542
You think this is cool? Come on!

795
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,708
Your Wrath, the shuttle is ready.
Shall we depart?

796
00:49:41,792 --> 00:49:43,458
No, not yet.

797
00:49:43,958 --> 00:49:47,500
The princeling was taken
because he was vulnerable...

798
00:49:47,583 --> 00:49:50,417
exposed, soft.

799
00:49:51,083 --> 00:49:52,875
Prepare his carapace.

800
00:49:52,958 --> 00:49:55,292
But that will take time, Your Bloodness...

801
00:49:55,375 --> 00:49:59,292
Do it! We will perform Glordon's ceremony
on the Communiverse

802
00:49:59,833 --> 00:50:03,875
and they will quiver
at the full might of Hylurg!

803
00:50:06,417 --> 00:50:08,167
-Ready?
-Yes.

804
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:09,583
No.

805
00:50:09,667 --> 00:50:10,958
Okay, yes!

806
00:50:11,042 --> 00:50:12,125
On three.

807
00:50:12,208 --> 00:50:14,042
One, two...

808
00:50:14,125 --> 00:50:15,833
-Two and a half.
-Two and a half.

809
00:50:16,375 --> 00:50:17,375
Three!

810
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:25,750
-Again?
-Heck, yeah, again.

811
00:50:25,833 --> 00:50:27,917
-On three.
-One, two.

812
00:50:38,667 --> 00:50:40,042
Yeah!

813
00:51:30,667 --> 00:51:31,667
No, no.

814
00:51:33,333 --> 00:51:34,333
Noice.

815
00:51:38,583 --> 00:51:40,958
So, everyone speaks Elioese on Earth?

816
00:51:41,042 --> 00:51:42,375
Nah, just me.

817
00:51:42,917 --> 00:51:44,292
And my parents.

818
00:51:45,417 --> 00:51:47,917
Or at least they did.

819
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,667
My aunt's not into it,

820
00:51:50,333 --> 00:51:53,875
but I keep using it so I don't forget.

821
00:51:55,083 --> 00:51:58,000
Did something happen to your parents?

822
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:00,583
Yeah.

823
00:52:02,125 --> 00:52:03,125
I'm sorry.

824
00:52:03,875 --> 00:52:07,333
I know it's not the same,
but my mom's gone a lot.

825
00:52:07,417 --> 00:52:09,083
Fighting the Blood Wars.

826
00:52:09,833 --> 00:52:11,083
I miss her a ton.

827
00:52:11,875 --> 00:52:15,083
Sometimes it feels like
Dad doesn't even want me.

828
00:52:16,875 --> 00:52:17,958
I know what you mean.

829
00:52:20,875 --> 00:52:24,083
The only people who wanted me are gone.

830
00:52:25,125 --> 00:52:27,042
But I don't know.

831
00:52:29,042 --> 00:52:30,042
What if...

832
00:52:31,667 --> 00:52:34,333
What if there's nothing about me to want?

833
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,417
I thought Earth was the problem...

834
00:52:41,292 --> 00:52:42,542
but what if it's me?

835
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:46,125
Well, I like you.

836
00:52:47,167 --> 00:52:48,542
And you seem fine to me.

837
00:53:19,667 --> 00:53:20,958
He brought your carapace.

838
00:53:21,042 --> 00:53:22,375
I guess so?

839
00:53:22,458 --> 00:53:24,292
But that's good, right?

840
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:28,417
Yeah. I mean, it has a flame thrower,
a circular saw, acid gun.

841
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:32,375
I'll get to fight,
and conquer, and kill, and...

842
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:35,750
Glordon,

843
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:38,500
do you not want to get into your carapace?

844
00:53:38,583 --> 00:53:41,125
Yeah, I mean, kind of, well...

845
00:53:41,208 --> 00:53:42,833
No, no.

846
00:53:42,917 --> 00:53:46,292
I've been pretending to want it,
but I've been living a lie!

847
00:53:49,792 --> 00:53:53,250
Once I'm installed,
I'll never get to play, or swim,

848
00:53:53,333 --> 00:53:54,833
or do anything.

849
00:53:54,917 --> 00:53:56,250
It'll be the worst!

850
00:53:58,458 --> 00:54:00,375
But why didn't you say something?

851
00:54:00,458 --> 00:54:02,792
Because all Hylurgians have to do it!

852
00:54:02,875 --> 00:54:04,167
It's tradition.

853
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:05,750
And if I don't,

854
00:54:07,333 --> 00:54:09,417
my dad would hate me.

855
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,792
Glordon, you're not getting in there.

856
00:54:18,875 --> 00:54:21,583
But I don't have a choice.

857
00:54:22,167 --> 00:54:23,292
We'll figure it out.

858
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,500
I don't know how, but...

859
00:54:28,167 --> 00:54:29,167
Oh, wait.

860
00:54:30,583 --> 00:54:31,583
What?

861
00:54:33,792 --> 00:54:34,875
What are we doing?

862
00:54:34,958 --> 00:54:36,167
We're going
to give your dad what he wants.

863
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:37,333
Me?

864
00:54:37,417 --> 00:54:38,792
Well, yes, but also no.

865
00:54:39,833 --> 00:54:41,875
Cloning clay? Are you sure about this?

866
00:54:41,958 --> 00:54:43,292
Yeah. Why not?

867
00:54:43,833 --> 00:54:46,375
I don't know.
Would a clone really fool my dad?

868
00:54:46,458 --> 00:54:47,667
He's pretty smart.

869
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:50,042
It's going to work. I'll show you.

870
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:51,417
Ooooo? Ooooo?

871
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,833
-Yes?
-Can I check on my clone?

872
00:54:53,917 --> 00:54:55,292
Certainly.

873
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:57,375
That smells good, papito.

874
00:54:57,458 --> 00:54:58,542
It's a secret recipe.

875
00:54:58,625 --> 00:54:59,958
You're going to love it.

876
00:55:00,042 --> 00:55:02,000
How are you so good at everything?

877
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:10,333
Wow. I guess it does work.

878
00:55:10,417 --> 00:55:12,042
Okay, let's do it.

879
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:13,542
Yeah.

880
00:55:14,542 --> 00:55:15,458
Yeah!

881
00:55:15,542 --> 00:55:18,292
Okay. Your dad will take
your clone back to Hylurg,

882
00:55:18,375 --> 00:55:19,875
I'll become an Ambassador,

883
00:55:19,958 --> 00:55:21,792
and neither of us will have to see Hylurg,

884
00:55:21,875 --> 00:55:23,042
or stupid Earth again.

885
00:55:23,125 --> 00:55:24,583
It's a win-win-win.

886
00:55:30,042 --> 00:55:31,042
Yes.

887
00:55:35,083 --> 00:55:36,083
I'm Glordon!

888
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:38,250
Wow! Am I really that ripped?

889
00:55:38,333 --> 00:55:39,417
You, follow us.

890
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:40,625
You got it.

891
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:46,750
You'll be safe in here.
No one else can open it.

892
00:55:48,083 --> 00:55:49,750
All right, Glordon, get in the ship.

893
00:55:49,833 --> 00:55:50,792
Okay.

894
00:55:50,875 --> 00:55:52,250
I can't tell you apart.

895
00:55:52,333 --> 00:55:53,458
Yes!

896
00:55:53,542 --> 00:55:55,125
Seriously, though, which one's real?

897
00:55:55,208 --> 00:55:56,208
Me.

898
00:55:58,125 --> 00:56:00,375
Stay inside and don't make a sound.

899
00:56:02,917 --> 00:56:04,042
I'll be right back.

900
00:56:08,375 --> 00:56:09,375
Come on.

901
00:56:11,458 --> 00:56:14,375
You look so good.
I can't even tell the difference.

902
00:56:15,792 --> 00:56:17,292
I can't even tell the difference.

903
00:56:17,375 --> 00:56:18,458
I know.

904
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:21,083
Who knew yogurt is just
as yummy as butter,

905
00:56:21,625 --> 00:56:23,125
and half the cholesterol?

906
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:25,750
It's perfect.

907
00:56:27,458 --> 00:56:28,583
Let me get that for you.

908
00:56:29,375 --> 00:56:30,583
Thanks so much.

909
00:56:35,333 --> 00:56:36,875
Well, I'm going to turn in for the night.

910
00:56:36,958 --> 00:56:40,583
All right.
But first, get over here, kiddo.

911
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:45,375
Good night.

912
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:24,250
What the?

913
00:58:19,083 --> 00:58:20,792
Hi. We should probably talk.

914
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:27,792
And for my next trick, think of a number.

915
00:58:28,875 --> 00:58:29,875
Wait.

916
00:58:30,583 --> 00:58:31,708
Okay, got it!

917
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:33,458
Yes, yes, yes.

918
00:58:33,542 --> 00:58:35,750
I don't know how much longer we can stall.

919
00:58:35,833 --> 00:58:36,917
Where is Candidate Solís?

920
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,375
I'm sure he'll be here momentarily.

921
00:58:39,458 --> 00:58:42,208
I sense the number is

922
00:58:42,292 --> 00:58:44,125
-seven.
-What?

923
00:58:44,208 --> 00:58:46,042
-She's right.
-Enough!

924
00:58:46,583 --> 00:58:48,375
Where is my son?

925
00:58:49,208 --> 00:58:51,208
He's here. He's right here.

926
00:58:51,292 --> 00:58:52,333
Daddy.

927
00:58:53,042 --> 00:58:55,125
-He did not abandon us.
-He's here!

928
00:58:55,208 --> 00:58:56,750
Thank the stars.

929
00:58:56,833 --> 00:59:00,375
Lord Grigon, we return
to you Prince Glordon.

930
00:59:00,458 --> 00:59:02,542
My son. Did he harm you?

931
00:59:02,625 --> 00:59:04,792
Nope. Everyone was super nice.

932
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:10,292
Are you prepared to become
the greatest war machine in the universe?

933
00:59:10,375 --> 00:59:13,750
To make your enemies tremble
at the sight of you?

934
00:59:13,833 --> 00:59:15,458
To prove the might of the...

935
00:59:15,542 --> 00:59:16,667
Yep! Let's do it!

936
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,750
Actually, I had more to say,
but, yes, let us get on with it.

937
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:36,250
Oh, yeah.

938
01:00:42,792 --> 01:00:45,417
Witness the power of Hylurg.

939
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:47,333
Witness!

940
01:00:47,417 --> 01:00:48,625
-What a good show.
-Very impressive.

941
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:50,917
That's right.

942
01:00:52,125 --> 01:00:53,708
As you have kept your word,

943
01:00:53,792 --> 01:00:57,750
I will keep mine
and leave this place never to return.

944
01:00:57,833 --> 01:01:00,125
Hylurgians, fall back.

945
01:01:01,583 --> 01:01:03,583
Candidate Solís, you did it!

946
01:01:03,667 --> 01:01:04,833
Well done.

947
01:01:04,917 --> 01:01:06,417
What an exceptional specimen.

948
01:01:06,917 --> 01:01:08,250
You good, son?

949
01:01:08,333 --> 01:01:10,833
Oh, yeah. I can't wait to make endless war

950
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:13,125
and pillage the unworthy
and bring eternal night...

951
01:01:13,208 --> 01:01:16,750
May I have the honor of joining
the Communiverse?

952
01:01:17,417 --> 01:01:20,833
The honor would be ours, Candidate Solís.

953
01:01:20,917 --> 01:01:23,875
Or should I say, Ambassador Solís.

954
01:01:23,958 --> 01:01:25,208
You're one of us now.

955
01:01:25,292 --> 01:01:26,583
-I like you.
-Welcome!

956
01:01:39,167 --> 01:01:40,292
It was a clone.

957
01:01:40,375 --> 01:01:42,708
Where is my son?

958
01:01:42,792 --> 01:01:43,792
But...

959
01:01:44,542 --> 01:01:45,625
How could you tell?

960
01:01:45,708 --> 01:01:48,792
A father always knows.

961
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:52,750
You, read his mind.

962
01:01:52,833 --> 01:01:54,375
Find the truth.

963
01:01:54,458 --> 01:01:55,458
No.

964
01:01:56,208 --> 01:01:57,292
Unhand me!

965
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:58,458
I'm so sorry.

966
01:01:58,542 --> 01:01:59,833
No.

967
01:01:59,917 --> 01:02:00,917
No.

968
01:02:02,667 --> 01:02:05,375
No, no, no, please. No!

969
01:02:09,208 --> 01:02:11,208
What? What did you see?

970
01:02:11,292 --> 01:02:15,500
Your son is in
a diplomatic ship in the docking bay.

971
01:02:15,583 --> 01:02:17,042
Send the troops!

972
01:02:22,333 --> 01:02:23,875
Oh, more pudding, Elio?

973
01:02:23,958 --> 01:02:25,375
Why, thank you, Glordon!

974
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:35,417
Elio?

975
01:02:38,917 --> 01:02:40,875
You have selected
a map of our coordinates.

976
01:02:40,958 --> 01:02:43,083
Neck pillow. Lip balm. A breath mint.

977
01:02:43,917 --> 01:02:45,000
Destination?

978
01:02:45,083 --> 01:02:46,208
Uh, Earth.

979
01:02:46,292 --> 01:02:48,083
Confirm or cancel?

980
01:02:48,167 --> 01:02:50,250
What? Confirm?

981
01:02:58,208 --> 01:03:00,708
Ooooo, open a portal to Earth.

982
01:03:03,292 --> 01:03:04,625
What are you doing?

983
01:03:04,708 --> 01:03:07,167
Will you tell them, or must I?

984
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:09,750
Please don't.

985
01:03:10,333 --> 01:03:12,750
He is not the leader of Earth.

986
01:03:12,833 --> 01:03:15,292
-What?
-He is not the leader of anything.

987
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:17,250
He is just

988
01:03:17,333 --> 01:03:18,333
a child.

989
01:03:18,833 --> 01:03:19,833
-What?
-Oh, no.

990
01:03:19,917 --> 01:03:20,917
-I do not understand.
-No.

991
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,792
She's wrong.

992
01:03:23,417 --> 01:03:24,542
I am the leader of Earth.

993
01:03:27,833 --> 01:03:29,292
I can still help!

994
01:03:29,375 --> 01:03:31,750
Just please, please let me stay.

995
01:03:32,417 --> 01:03:33,750
He is not there!

996
01:03:33,833 --> 01:03:35,250
-What?
-But I saw him!

997
01:03:35,333 --> 01:03:36,708
We are as surprised as you.

998
01:03:36,792 --> 01:03:42,083
Arrest them all! The Communiverse
is now under Hylurgian control.

999
01:03:51,167 --> 01:03:52,625
Don't touch me.

1000
01:03:52,708 --> 01:03:54,167
We can sort this out!

1001
01:03:54,917 --> 01:03:56,750
It's his fault, not ours!

1002
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:59,625
Liar! Betrayer! Coward!

1003
01:03:59,708 --> 01:04:00,958
Leave! Now!

1004
01:04:01,833 --> 01:04:02,792
I'm so sorry.

1005
01:04:02,875 --> 01:04:03,875
You've done enough!

1006
01:04:04,917 --> 01:04:06,875
No!

1007
01:04:19,875 --> 01:04:23,542
Tear this place apart
until you find my son!

1008
01:04:51,917 --> 01:04:52,958
No.

1009
01:05:07,042 --> 01:05:08,292
Don't leave me.

1010
01:05:11,667 --> 01:05:12,792
Please.

1011
01:05:42,833 --> 01:05:44,083
Oh, I'll take that.

1012
01:05:44,167 --> 01:05:45,167
Thanks, kiddo.

1013
01:05:51,667 --> 01:05:54,125
Shoot. I left the... That...

1014
01:05:54,208 --> 01:05:56,292
-I know what it is. Be right back.
-Thank you.

1015
01:06:15,458 --> 01:06:18,250
You couldn't find it, huh?
Would you toss me those?

1016
01:06:38,292 --> 01:06:39,417
Come on!

1017
01:06:40,042 --> 01:06:41,417
Stupid flashlight!

1018
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:44,708
Sorry.

1019
01:06:48,875 --> 01:06:50,125
Are you okay?

1020
01:06:50,208 --> 01:06:52,458
No. I feel crazy!

1021
01:06:52,542 --> 01:06:57,042
I'm on the beach trying
to make contact with I don't know what.

1022
01:07:00,208 --> 01:07:01,208
I just...

1023
01:07:03,333 --> 01:07:04,542
feel so...

1024
01:07:06,125 --> 01:07:07,125
alone.

1025
01:07:09,833 --> 01:07:11,042
You wouldn't understand.

1026
01:07:22,125 --> 01:07:23,125
Actually,

1027
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:25,833
I do.

1028
01:08:04,375 --> 01:08:06,333
I didn't think you'd miss me.

1029
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:09,250
I missed you.

1030
01:08:10,292 --> 01:08:13,083
I've missed everything about you.

1031
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:18,417
But this isn't the life you wanted.

1032
01:08:21,457 --> 01:08:23,167
The only thing I want

1033
01:08:24,207 --> 01:08:25,207
is you.

1034
01:08:40,582 --> 01:08:41,582
Tía Olga!

1035
01:08:42,417 --> 01:08:44,332
Oh, hey, you're back!

1036
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:47,750
Something's going on at the base.

1037
01:08:59,707 --> 01:09:02,417
Wait. That's my spaceship.

1038
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:04,207
-Glordon's in there!
-Who?

1039
01:09:04,292 --> 01:09:05,625
My friend.

1040
01:09:05,707 --> 01:09:07,375
-You made a friend?
-Nice.

1041
01:09:07,457 --> 01:09:10,457
Yeah, and he needs our help.
You have clearance, right?

1042
01:09:10,542 --> 01:09:11,667
Not for this.

1043
01:09:13,332 --> 01:09:14,832
There's got to be some way
to get in there.

1044
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:16,167
Okay, okay. Let me think.

1045
01:09:20,082 --> 01:09:23,457
Well, if you don't need me anymore,
I will begin my decomposition process.

1046
01:09:23,542 --> 01:09:26,375
Feel free to spread me over
a plant as nutritious fertilizer.

1047
01:09:30,042 --> 01:09:31,207
Wait!

1048
01:09:37,667 --> 01:09:39,375
They mention what it is?

1049
01:09:39,457 --> 01:09:42,417
Negative. But AARO's here
and NASA's on the way.

1050
01:09:44,457 --> 01:09:47,457
Is it extraterrestrial?

1051
01:09:47,542 --> 01:09:50,832
What, like little green men?
Don't tell me you believe in that stuff.

1052
01:09:54,082 --> 01:09:55,333
Who's there?

1053
01:09:59,083 --> 01:10:00,083
It's a kid.

1054
01:10:00,167 --> 01:10:01,458
Hey, you shouldn't be here.

1055
01:10:06,083 --> 01:10:08,208
Can you help me?

1056
01:10:19,917 --> 01:10:22,750
I don't feel so good.

1057
01:10:25,125 --> 01:10:26,083
Get it off me!

1058
01:10:26,167 --> 01:10:27,500
Get it off me!

1059
01:10:30,167 --> 01:10:31,417
It's in my mouth!

1060
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:32,458
Why is it sour?

1061
01:10:32,542 --> 01:10:33,667
It's on me too!

1062
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:35,292
Help! Help!

1063
01:10:39,167 --> 01:10:40,708
Thank you for your service.

1064
01:11:25,375 --> 01:11:26,375
Glordon!

1065
01:11:32,917 --> 01:11:34,708
Is that your friend?

1066
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:36,542
Elio?

1067
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:38,750
What are you doing here?

1068
01:11:39,375 --> 01:11:40,625
What are you doing here?

1069
01:11:40,708 --> 01:11:42,458
Why didn't you stay where I told you?

1070
01:11:42,542 --> 01:11:43,792
I'm sorry.

1071
01:11:43,875 --> 01:11:47,208
I accidentally turned on the ship.

1072
01:11:51,917 --> 01:11:53,667
Glordon? Glordon.

1073
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:55,667
-Is he sick?
-His disc is broken.

1074
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:57,083
It's too cold for him here!

1075
01:11:57,167 --> 01:11:58,250
Hey!

1076
01:11:58,333 --> 01:12:00,958
Put your hands up!
Back away from the specimen.

1077
01:12:02,042 --> 01:12:04,750
I said, back away! Now!

1078
01:12:08,708 --> 01:12:10,083
You learned Elioese?

1079
01:12:13,917 --> 01:12:14,833
Hey, what are you saying?

1080
01:12:19,042 --> 01:12:20,958
-Oh, you mean "glöp."
-Stop that!

1081
01:12:24,375 --> 01:12:25,417
Gun it!

1082
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Oh, my gosh.

1083
01:12:48,625 --> 01:12:50,000
This is so...

1084
01:12:50,083 --> 01:12:51,292
Oh, my gosh.

1085
01:12:51,875 --> 01:12:54,625
Hold on, Glordon. Olga, you got to drive!

1086
01:12:54,708 --> 01:12:56,208
-But how?
-Please!

1087
01:12:56,750 --> 01:12:58,208
Welcome, guest pilot!

1088
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:01,708
Give me your jacket.

1089
01:13:03,375 --> 01:13:06,417
I'm so sorry, Glordon.
This is all my fault.

1090
01:13:09,292 --> 01:13:10,583
Don't worry.

1091
01:13:10,667 --> 01:13:12,083
I'm going to get you home.

1092
01:13:13,333 --> 01:13:14,875
Ship, get us to the Communiverse.

1093
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:18,708
Hyper-speed unavailable, path blocked.

1094
01:13:18,792 --> 01:13:20,625
What? It's totally clear.

1095
01:13:20,708 --> 01:13:23,583
I said, "Hyper-speed unavailable,
path blocked."

1096
01:13:23,667 --> 01:13:24,792
Oh, come on!

1097
01:13:31,625 --> 01:13:32,625
What?

1098
01:13:37,917 --> 01:13:38,917
We're in a debris field.

1099
01:13:39,917 --> 01:13:41,833
-Let's just get out of here.
-No!

1100
01:13:42,708 --> 01:13:45,500
-These objects are faster than bullets.
-But this is what you do.

1101
01:13:45,583 --> 01:13:46,917
From the ground.

1102
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,667
I don't know where
the debris's coming from.

1103
01:13:48,750 --> 01:13:50,667
I need altitudes, velocity...

1104
01:13:51,958 --> 01:13:54,417
If I could just contact someone
on the ground.

1105
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:56,208
But the base is on lockdown.

1106
01:13:56,292 --> 01:13:59,875
Maybe someone with a Ham radio.
I don't know!

1107
01:14:01,292 --> 01:14:02,292
Elio?

1108
01:14:03,417 --> 01:14:05,500
Bro, I bet that UFO was real.

1109
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:09,542
What if they're here for food
and the only thing they eat are hamsters?

1110
01:14:10,167 --> 01:14:11,292
I'm fine with that.

1111
01:14:19,542 --> 01:14:21,792
PXLOL, please respond.

1112
01:14:21,875 --> 01:14:23,167
PXLOL, come in!

1113
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:25,167
Hello? This is PXLOL.

1114
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:26,250
Bryce!

1115
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:28,708
This is Elio.

1116
01:14:29,542 --> 01:14:30,875
Solís?

1117
01:14:30,958 --> 01:14:32,125
I'm sorry about what happened.

1118
01:14:32,208 --> 01:14:34,542
Caleb can be a real butt sometimes.

1119
01:14:34,625 --> 01:14:37,833
It's okay, I was a butt too.

1120
01:14:38,458 --> 01:14:41,417
Look, you might not believe this,
but we're in an alien ship that just...

1121
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:44,458
That's you? Aw, man!
There's a lot of radio chatter about that.

1122
01:14:44,542 --> 01:14:46,667
Yeah, that's us.
We're trying to fly through debris,

1123
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:48,958
but we need to know where it's coming...

1124
01:14:49,042 --> 01:14:51,125
How's your math? Physics?
Are you good at physics?

1125
01:14:52,125 --> 01:14:55,125
Bryce, I really need your help.

1126
01:14:55,208 --> 01:14:56,458
Please.

1127
01:14:56,542 --> 01:14:58,625
I don't know anything about debris,

1128
01:14:59,167 --> 01:15:00,667
but I know someone who does.

1129
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:03,375
He's a legend in my radio group.

1130
01:15:03,458 --> 01:15:06,375
The boss. The eyes in the sky. He's...

1131
01:15:06,458 --> 01:15:09,083
Melmac reporting for duty!

1132
01:15:09,167 --> 01:15:11,250
I'll take it from here, PXLOL!

1133
01:15:11,333 --> 01:15:13,875
Elio, you better come back
in one piece, okay?

1134
01:15:13,958 --> 01:15:15,042
I'll tell you all about it.

1135
01:15:15,125 --> 01:15:17,458
Thank you, Melmac, I owe you a huge...

1136
01:15:17,542 --> 01:15:18,542
Never mind that, Major.

1137
01:15:18,625 --> 01:15:21,833
A Master of Ham always helps in a jam.

1138
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:24,542
Let's get you through this debris field.

1139
01:15:24,625 --> 01:15:26,500
I'm pulling up the network now. Get ready.

1140
01:15:26,583 --> 01:15:28,042
We need a fixed target.

1141
01:15:28,125 --> 01:15:29,208
Orion's belt.

1142
01:15:29,292 --> 01:15:30,792
Perfect. Drive straight toward it,

1143
01:15:30,875 --> 01:15:32,250
-and be ready to dodge.
-Okay.

1144
01:15:32,333 --> 01:15:35,167
Ship, can you project a grid?

1145
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,625
Okay. Melmac, anything out there!
Hurry, before we're out of range!

1146
01:15:40,708 --> 01:15:42,208
Okay. Large rocket body!

1147
01:15:42,292 --> 01:15:43,875
Altitude, 407 kilometers,

1148
01:15:43,958 --> 01:15:45,333
velocity, 7.66.

1149
01:15:45,417 --> 01:15:46,417
Got it.

1150
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:47,333
There.

1151
01:15:47,417 --> 01:15:48,500
Where? I don't see it!

1152
01:15:48,583 --> 01:15:49,792
Just pull back. Now!

1153
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,417
Another one!
788 kilometers, velocity, 7.46.

1154
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:57,375
-Climb fast! Now!
-Roger!

1155
01:15:59,708 --> 01:16:00,958
We are going ham.

1156
01:16:01,625 --> 01:16:02,958
You're doing great.

1157
01:16:03,042 --> 01:16:04,625
Melmac, keep them coming.

1158
01:16:04,708 --> 01:16:07,292
Major, you're leaving the com window.
Just stay on this frequency.

1159
01:16:07,833 --> 01:16:09,375
Stay... Frequency...

1160
01:16:09,458 --> 01:16:11,250
Melmac? Melmac?

1161
01:16:13,708 --> 01:16:16,208
Shields at 80%.

1162
01:16:18,667 --> 01:16:19,667
Glordon.

1163
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:21,333
Is anyone there?

1164
01:16:21,417 --> 01:16:24,458
Please, anyone?
Mayday! Mayday! Come in. Come in!

1165
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:28,458
Shields at 60%.

1166
01:16:36,958 --> 01:16:38,917
Shields at 41%.

1167
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,708
Shields at 23%.

1168
01:16:45,792 --> 01:16:48,625
Mayday! Mayday! Come in. Come in!

1169
01:16:48,708 --> 01:16:51,417
-Hello?
-Shields at 16%.

1170
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:52,958
Is anyone out there?

1171
01:16:53,958 --> 01:16:55,375
Can anyone hear us?

1172
01:17:11,250 --> 01:17:12,250
...Senegal.

1173
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,792
Bonjour.
This is Masters of Ham in Senegal.

1174
01:17:16,875 --> 01:17:18,417
Yes, yes. We read you.

1175
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:23,042
Large debris at 1,300 kilometers,
velocity, 7.2.

1176
01:17:23,125 --> 01:17:24,833
Pull back! Hard!

1177
01:17:26,333 --> 01:17:27,500
Thank you. Thank you.

1178
01:17:27,583 --> 01:17:28,917
Masters of Ham at your service.

1179
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,500
This is Giulia from Italia.

1180
01:17:30,583 --> 01:17:31,958
This is awesome!

1181
01:17:32,042 --> 01:17:34,000
-2224, velocity 6.81.
-Right.

1182
01:17:34,917 --> 01:17:36,667
This is Anoush in Armenia.

1183
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:38,167
-Velocity, 6.75.
-Right!

1184
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:39,292
Namaste.

1185
01:17:39,375 --> 01:17:40,667
-This is Vikram from Mumbai.
-Climb!

1186
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:42,667
Debris at 2,753,

1187
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:44,958
-velocity, 6.61.
-Left!

1188
01:17:45,042 --> 01:17:47,333
-This is Hoang in Vietnam.
-...velocity, 6...

1189
01:17:47,417 --> 01:17:49,208
Konnichiwa from Japan.

1190
01:17:49,292 --> 01:17:50,750
-You can do this!
-You're going to be okay.

1191
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:52,667
-You're not alone.
-Hey, come on, buddy!

1192
01:17:52,750 --> 01:17:53,667
-Go, go, go!
-Come on, kid!

1193
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:55,417
-Keep going!
-You're almost there!

1194
01:17:57,958 --> 01:18:00,167
There's one more piece! Move, move!

1195
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:01,417
-Which way?
-I don't know.

1196
01:18:17,292 --> 01:18:18,292
Path cleared.

1197
01:18:32,417 --> 01:18:33,417
Glordon?

1198
01:18:37,375 --> 01:18:39,000
Engaging hyper-speed.

1199
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:07,583
Help us. Please.

1200
01:19:08,458 --> 01:19:09,875
-Elio.
-Glordon. No!

1201
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:11,083
Get off me!

1202
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Glordon.

1203
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:27,708
Glordon, wake up.

1204
01:19:31,875 --> 01:19:32,875
No.

1205
01:19:33,875 --> 01:19:35,375
I can't lose you too.

1206
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
No!

1207
01:20:49,792 --> 01:20:51,875
Explain yourselves.

1208
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:57,750
I can't.

1209
01:20:57,833 --> 01:20:59,500
Just tell him.

1210
01:21:00,208 --> 01:21:01,792
He loves you.

1211
01:21:02,333 --> 01:21:04,208
Look how much he wanted you back.

1212
01:21:10,750 --> 01:21:13,250
I don't want to be a war machine.

1213
01:21:18,833 --> 01:21:20,208
You already know?

1214
01:21:21,083 --> 01:21:22,083
Yes.

1215
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,167
I may not always understand you,

1216
01:21:28,792 --> 01:21:30,542
but I still love you.

1217
01:21:39,042 --> 01:21:43,000
It's a loose swaddle.
I do not have your mother's touch.

1218
01:21:43,083 --> 01:21:44,333
You did great.

1219
01:21:46,542 --> 01:21:49,833
I have never uttered these words before,

1220
01:21:50,917 --> 01:21:54,750
but I am sorry.

1221
01:21:56,417 --> 01:21:57,542
Release them all.

1222
01:22:24,333 --> 01:22:27,750
Congratulations, Ambassador Solís!

1223
01:22:29,542 --> 01:22:31,583
But I lied to you!

1224
01:22:31,667 --> 01:22:35,292
And then you sacrificed yourself
to save another.

1225
01:22:35,917 --> 01:22:40,292
You behaved as admirably
as any real planetary leader.

1226
01:22:40,375 --> 01:22:42,042
And you did bring peace.

1227
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:43,792
Eventually.

1228
01:22:43,875 --> 01:22:45,917
You have earned your place here.

1229
01:22:46,625 --> 01:22:48,083
I could stay?

1230
01:22:48,167 --> 01:22:49,333
Yes, yes, yes!

1231
01:22:53,042 --> 01:22:54,208
Excellent.

1232
01:22:55,167 --> 01:22:56,833
We can hang out every day.

1233
01:23:58,458 --> 01:24:00,292
This place is amazing,

1234
01:24:00,792 --> 01:24:03,125
but Earth is...

1235
01:24:04,750 --> 01:24:05,750
home.

1236
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:08,708
I didn't give it a chance

1237
01:24:10,417 --> 01:24:11,417
but now,

1238
01:24:12,958 --> 01:24:13,958
I want to try.

1239
01:24:19,625 --> 01:24:20,667
With you.

1240
01:24:25,125 --> 01:24:26,333
Are you sure?

1241
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,042
We're family.

1242
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:41,542
This isn't goodbye.

1243
01:24:42,042 --> 01:24:44,500
It's just not yet.

1244
01:24:47,458 --> 01:24:48,625
We understand.

1245
01:24:50,375 --> 01:24:53,542
You are unique, Elio of Earth,

1246
01:24:53,625 --> 01:24:57,375
and "unique"
can sometimes feel like "alone."

1247
01:24:58,750 --> 01:25:01,125
But you are not alone.

1248
01:25:04,917 --> 01:25:05,917
Okay.

1249
01:25:06,417 --> 01:25:07,417
Bye.

1250
01:25:07,958 --> 01:25:08,958
I love you.

1251
01:25:15,333 --> 01:25:18,417
Okay. Bye. I love you.

1252
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:21,208
Okay. Bye. I love you.

1253
01:25:22,833 --> 01:25:25,417
Okay. Bye. I love you.

1254
01:25:28,042 --> 01:25:30,292
Okay. Bye. I love you.

1255
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:40,250
I love you, too.

1256
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Let's go home.

1257
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:33,417
It's an ancient human theme.

1258
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:36,000
You can find it
in virtually every culture.

1259
01:26:36,083 --> 01:26:39,833
In religion, folklore,
superstition, and, now, in science.

1260
01:26:41,250 --> 01:26:45,542
The search for life elsewhere
is remarkable in our age

1261
01:26:46,083 --> 01:26:50,750
because this is the first time that we can
actually do something besides speculation.

1262
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:59,250
We can send spacecraft to nearby planets.

1263
01:27:00,792 --> 01:27:02,833
We can use large radio telescopes to see

1264
01:27:02,917 --> 01:27:05,917
if there is any message
being sent to us lately.

1265
01:27:08,333 --> 01:27:12,042
And it touches to
the deepest of human concerns.

1266
01:27:12,875 --> 01:27:13,917
Are we alone?

1267
01:29:41,208 --> 01:29:43,375
Glordon, your disc is muted.

1268
01:29:43,458 --> 01:29:44,542
Oops, sorry.

1269
01:29:44,625 --> 01:29:47,542
Now, tell me everything.
