1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000

3
00:00:24,546 --> 00:00:27,723
We live and die
in the shadows,

4
00:00:27,897 --> 00:00:30,030
for those we hold close

5
00:00:30,204 --> 00:00:32,467
and for those we never meet.

6
00:00:34,425 --> 00:00:36,775
The end you
always feared is coming.

7
00:00:36,949 --> 00:00:38,864
The Anti-God.

8
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,084
This "entity" has
multiple personalities.

9
00:00:41,258 --> 00:00:43,086
You’re
telling me this thing
has a mind of its own?

10
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,958
A self-aware,
self-learning,
truth-eating digital parasite

11
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:48,135
infesting all of cyberspace.

12
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:50,963
An enemy that
is everywhere and nowhere
and has no center.

13
00:00:51,138 --> 00:00:53,009
Patiently
listening, reading, watching.

14
00:00:53,183 --> 00:00:55,881
Harvesting our deepest
personal secrets for years.

15
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,668
Able to
beguile, blackmail, bribe
or be anyone it wants.

16
00:00:59,842 --> 00:01:01,974
Ethan, that is not me!
You’re talking to the Entity.

17
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:04,977
Whoever controls
the Entity controls the truth.

18
00:01:05,152 --> 00:01:07,719
...most secure data centers
are breached and corrupted.

19
00:01:07,893 --> 00:01:09,286
The Entity will know precisely

20
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,896
how to undermine
our every strength.

21
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,507
Turn
our allies into enemies...

22
00:01:12,681 --> 00:01:14,248
And exploit our every weakness.

23
00:01:14,422 --> 00:01:16,815
...and
our enemies into aggressors.

24
00:01:16,989 --> 00:01:20,123
An unstoppable force
of destructive power that would
just lay waste to everything.

25
00:01:20,297 --> 00:01:24,214
The world is
changing. Truth is vanishing.

26
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,303
War is coming.

27
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:54,723
Good evening, Ethan.

28
00:01:54,897 --> 00:01:56,290
This is your president.

29
00:01:56,464 --> 00:01:59,293
Since you won’t reply
to anyone else,

30
00:01:59,467 --> 00:02:01,338
I thought
I’d reach out directly.

31
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:04,080
First, I want to thank you

32
00:02:04,254 --> 00:02:07,779
for a lifetime of devoted
and unrelenting service.

33
00:02:11,653 --> 00:02:15,483
Were it not for
the tireless dedication
of you and your team,

34
00:02:15,657 --> 00:02:18,660
the Earth would be
a very different place.

35
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:22,142
It might not
even be here at all.

36
00:02:24,274 --> 00:02:25,971
Every risk you’ve taken...

37
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:30,280
every comrade you’ve lost
in the field...

38
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:39,071
every personal sacrifice
you made...

39
00:02:40,421 --> 00:02:43,946
has brought this world
another sunrise.

40
00:02:46,383 --> 00:02:50,735
It’s been 35 years
since circumstances
brought you to us

41
00:02:51,649 --> 00:02:53,608
and you were given the choice,

42
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:56,524
since the IMF saved you

43
00:02:56,698 --> 00:02:58,439
from a life in prison.

44
00:03:00,571 --> 00:03:02,921
And though you
never followed orders,

45
00:03:03,748 --> 00:03:05,837
you never let us down.

46
00:03:23,028 --> 00:03:25,640
You were always
the best of men...

47
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,600
in the worst of times.

48
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,480
I need you to be that man now.

49
00:03:40,742 --> 00:03:43,135
In the months since you
evaded capture in Austria,

50
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:47,227
every corner of cyberspace
has been infested
by the truth-eating,

51
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:50,926
parasitic A.I. known
to us as the Entity.

52
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,493
Under its influence,

53
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:55,713
digital information
has been corrupted worldwide.

54
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:58,934
Nations and people no longer
know what to believe.

55
00:03:59,108 --> 00:04:00,544
Antagonism,

56
00:04:00,718 --> 00:04:03,895
aggression and martial law
are the new world order.

57
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:06,158
Exploiting this
paranoid atmosphere,

58
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,900
the Entity has inspired
a doomsday cult

59
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:11,860
with acolytes devoted to
ridding the world of corruption

60
00:04:12,034 --> 00:04:13,949
through human extinction.

61
00:04:14,123 --> 00:04:15,603
And He said unto Noah,
"Behold..."

62
00:04:15,777 --> 00:04:16,908
"I will bring a flood
upon the earth

63
00:04:17,082 --> 00:04:18,736
to destroy all flesh."

64
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,956
The children of the atom
shall rise from the ashes.

65
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,350
And the Entity will
help them rebuild.

66
00:04:23,524 --> 00:04:27,658
These fanatics
are secretly infiltrating
every level of law enforcement,

67
00:04:27,832 --> 00:04:30,095
government and our military,

68
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,316
devoted to serving their
digital master’s ultimate goal.

69
00:04:34,491 --> 00:04:36,928
Our only hope of
controlling the Entity

70
00:04:37,102 --> 00:04:40,149
relies on finding
its original source code.

71
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:44,284
If anyone knows the whereabouts
of this code, it’s this man.

72
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:48,679
His identity, his past,
his very existence
have been erased,

73
00:04:48,853 --> 00:04:53,684
suggesting he is or was
in league with the Entity.

74
00:04:53,858 --> 00:04:57,297
Austrian authorities have
his accomplice in custody.

75
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,212
But she has refused
to tell us anything.

76
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:03,477
Which brings us back to you.

77
00:05:03,651 --> 00:05:07,785
You are in possession
of a key believed
to be a vital component

78
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,832
in our struggle to acquire
the Entity’s source code.

79
00:05:11,006 --> 00:05:13,051
Yet you refuse to come in,

80
00:05:13,225 --> 00:05:16,446
fearing any government will
weaponize this malicious A.I.

81
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,753
against the rest of the world.

82
00:05:18,927 --> 00:05:21,190
Instead you’ve resolved
to kill the Entity,

83
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:25,542
a reckless act that
would trigger the total
annihilation of cyberspace.

84
00:05:25,716 --> 00:05:28,023
This would eradicate
the global economy,

85
00:05:28,197 --> 00:05:32,288
plunging the world into war
and famine without end.

86
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:35,726
Agent Hunt. Ethan.

87
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,033
Please surrender.

88
00:05:38,207 --> 00:05:41,645
Or the blood of the world
will be on your hands.

89
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:46,084
This message will
self-destruct in five seconds.

90
00:05:46,824 --> 00:05:48,260
Come home, Ethan,

91
00:05:49,087 --> 00:05:51,351
and bring us that key.

92
00:06:02,884 --> 00:06:05,408
End it now! End it now!

93
00:06:05,582 --> 00:06:08,672
End it now!
End it now! End it now!

94
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,990
End it now!
End it now! End it now!

95
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:26,750
Hey, Ethan.

96
00:07:27,751 --> 00:07:29,318
Hey, Luther.

97
00:07:29,492 --> 00:07:32,103
Sorry about the decor.
The Ritz was booked solid.

98
00:07:32,277 --> 00:07:35,063
Well, some drapes,
a few throw pillows, and...

99
00:07:35,237 --> 00:07:36,499
Yeah, a minibar.

100
00:07:39,284 --> 00:07:40,851
Foosball table.

101
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:49,817
Hey, bro.
Hey.

102
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:57,781
It’s always good to see you
on the right side of the grass.

103
00:07:59,391 --> 00:08:01,481
I’m worried you’re
working too hard.

104
00:08:02,394 --> 00:08:04,266
Don’t worry about ol’ Luther.

105
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,963
Okay.

106
00:08:06,137 --> 00:08:08,705
So, what did you
manage to find out?

107
00:08:10,054 --> 00:08:11,229
A lot.

108
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,537
More than I bargained for.

109
00:08:16,452 --> 00:08:18,019
So, what’s the play?

110
00:08:18,193 --> 00:08:19,150
First,

111
00:08:19,324 --> 00:08:21,283
we have to find Gabriel.

112
00:08:21,457 --> 00:08:23,415
How do we find him?

113
00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:37,865
You will betray us

114
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,476
because he spared your life.

115
00:09:34,225 --> 00:09:35,444
STOP. STOP.

116
00:09:37,402 --> 00:09:38,403
Wait, wait, wait!

117
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,365
Why...

118
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:45,976
did you spare my life?

119
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:52,200
Wait, wait, wait!

120
00:09:52,374 --> 00:09:54,724
You call that in, it’s the end
of the world-- simple as that.

121
00:09:54,898 --> 00:09:55,899
Degas, isn’t it?

122
00:09:56,073 --> 00:09:57,945
Clock is running.

123
00:09:58,119 --> 00:10:00,425
You take us in,
there won’t be anyone
on Earth who can stop it.

124
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,079
There’s a part of
you that knows that.

125
00:10:02,253 --> 00:10:03,037
I can see it.

126
00:10:04,952 --> 00:10:06,431
For God’s sake,
just trust him!
Wait, wait, no!

127
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,129
It’s okay, it’s okay!

128
00:10:08,303 --> 00:10:10,610
Degas, it’s okay.
There’s no nations on this one.

129
00:10:10,784 --> 00:10:12,655
There’s no rival
ideologies, no dogma.

130
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:16,137
It’s who keeps their head
and who panics.

131
00:10:16,311 --> 00:10:19,227
The Entity wants you scared,
it wants us all scared.

132
00:10:19,401 --> 00:10:21,098
It wants us divided.

133
00:10:21,272 --> 00:10:23,579
It wants you to turn us in.

134
00:10:23,753 --> 00:10:25,625
Don’t do it.

135
00:10:30,368 --> 00:10:31,761
He’s gonna be okay.

136
00:10:32,327 --> 00:10:33,371
Please, Degas.

137
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,766
Please.

138
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,406
We’re friends.

139
00:11:18,982 --> 00:11:20,810
Gabriel...

140
00:11:20,984 --> 00:11:22,856
Where is he?

141
00:11:29,993 --> 00:11:31,995
You shouldn’t be
in there without backup.

142
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:34,084
Benji, please.
We got this.

143
00:11:34,258 --> 00:11:36,608
This is
a terrible idea.
Just relax.

144
00:11:36,783 --> 00:11:38,828
Ethan, this place is crawling
with clandestine services.

145
00:11:39,002 --> 00:11:40,308
You should get out of there.

146
00:11:40,482 --> 00:11:42,963
I see them. It’s okay.
Stay calm, Benji.

147
00:11:43,137 --> 00:11:45,356
I don’t think Gabriel would
risk coming to that party.

148
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:46,967
Abort.

149
00:11:47,141 --> 00:11:50,318
No, let’s just hold
our nerve. He’s here.

150
00:11:50,492 --> 00:11:52,233
He’s got to be here.

151
00:11:52,407 --> 00:11:54,365
Ethan, for God’s sake, abort!
We’ll figure this out.

152
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:56,759
Not a problem yet.

153
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,548
Stay where you are.

154
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,682
Don’t move, Hunt.

155
00:12:10,294 --> 00:12:12,470
Are you sure it’s really me?

156
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,173
All units, we have Hunt.
I repeat, we have Hunt.

157
00:12:19,347 --> 00:12:20,783
They can’t hear you.

158
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,051
Grace.

159
00:12:39,454 --> 00:12:42,022
I didn’t even see
you get that one.

160
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:44,546
What separates a good
pickpocket from a great one?

161
00:12:45,373 --> 00:12:46,548
Timing.

162
00:12:46,722 --> 00:12:48,245
Gentlemen?

163
00:12:54,121 --> 00:12:55,992
Nice and slow.

164
00:13:07,438 --> 00:13:09,266
Nothing personal.

165
00:13:14,358 --> 00:13:16,360
You know, I like
the longer hair.

166
00:13:16,534 --> 00:13:19,668
I really appreciate
your coming,
but you shouldn’t be here.

167
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:21,365
I didn’t have much choice.

168
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:23,628
Will you expect
me to betray him?

169
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,849
I expect you to
save him from himself

170
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:29,199
and the world from him.

171
00:13:30,548 --> 00:13:31,549
Kittridge.

172
00:13:33,682 --> 00:13:36,467
You just bought yourself
a world of trouble, Grace.

173
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:38,600
The whole world’s
in trouble, Ethan.

174
00:13:38,774 --> 00:13:41,385
You’re the only one
I trust to save it.

175
00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:45,085
So, what’s the play?

176
00:13:51,482 --> 00:13:52,527
Grace!

177
00:13:55,138 --> 00:13:56,400
Grace.

178
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:01,753
Gabriel’s got a job
for you, Hunt.

179
00:14:05,757 --> 00:14:06,715
Ethan, wake up!

180
00:14:09,979 --> 00:14:12,329
Okay, what do we do?

181
00:14:13,591 --> 00:14:15,550
Tell me you have a plan.

182
00:14:20,163 --> 00:14:21,599
They took my watch.

183
00:14:21,773 --> 00:14:24,515
Your watch?
Yeah, and my cuff links.

184
00:14:24,689 --> 00:14:26,735
Had lock picks in them.
I see.

185
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:29,085
We’ll find a way out,
okay? Now, listen.

186
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,743
Ah, it’s too late.

187
00:14:35,657 --> 00:14:36,963
It’s coming.

188
00:14:37,964 --> 00:14:39,704
Okay, Grace, look at me.

189
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,576
You’re gonna get through this.

190
00:14:43,143 --> 00:14:45,319
Get through what?

191
00:14:45,493 --> 00:14:47,625
Just keep telling yourself...

192
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:49,366
it’s only pain.

193
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:58,288
Stop!
Don’t touch him!

194
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:02,858
You can’t hurt him.

195
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,950
Not that way.

196
00:15:09,734 --> 00:15:11,127
Take you back to Shanghai?

197
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:13,086
What was her name?

198
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:15,566
Julia!

199
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,742
The former Mrs. Hunt.

200
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,701
Did Ethan fail to mention her?

201
00:15:20,745 --> 00:15:22,878
A fellow named
Davian took her...

202
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,229
and ransomed her for something

203
00:15:26,403 --> 00:15:29,754
only Ethan could get.

204
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,409
Davian called it
the Rabbit’s Foot.

205
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:33,976
But it had another name.

206
00:15:35,543 --> 00:15:37,066
The Anti-God.

207
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,113
They never told you what was
in that canister, did they?

208
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,245
But you always wondered.

209
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:45,596
Stealing the Rabbit’s Foot
was just one event

210
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:50,297
in a lifelong pattern,
repeating itself over and over.

211
00:15:50,471 --> 00:15:54,779
For every life
he’s tried to save,
he’s gambled millions more,

212
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,868
doubling down and down again.

213
00:15:57,043 --> 00:16:01,090
And now the fate of every
living soul on Earth is

214
00:16:01,264 --> 00:16:03,614
his responsibility.

215
00:16:03,788 --> 00:16:06,617
You must be exhausted.

216
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,054
Where’s the key?

217
00:16:08,576 --> 00:16:10,056
Let her go.

218
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,710
Then we’ll discuss it.
We don’t have the time.

219
00:16:12,884 --> 00:16:15,975
Someone you hold
close will die tonight

220
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:18,847
for the sake of those
you will never meet,

221
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:21,632
unless you do exactly as I say.

222
00:16:21,806 --> 00:16:24,418
He also said the key would
be his on the train, remember?

223
00:16:26,115 --> 00:16:27,725
You had one job:

224
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:32,078
Get on the train, get the key,
get off the train.

225
00:16:32,252 --> 00:16:36,430
How did your master
take the news when it
found out you blew it?

226
00:16:36,604 --> 00:16:38,040
You failed,

227
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:40,912
and now the Entity
has forsaken you.

228
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:44,220
Your team’s been
compromised, Ethan.

229
00:16:44,394 --> 00:16:48,181
I know what Luther’s doing.
I know what you’re planning.

230
00:16:48,355 --> 00:16:50,661
Resist me
and I’ll make you pay dearly.

231
00:16:50,835 --> 00:16:52,228
If you cooperate,

232
00:16:52,402 --> 00:16:54,100
I can help.

233
00:16:54,274 --> 00:16:56,276
In exchange for what?

234
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,714
You’re searching for
a Russian submarine
vanished on its maiden voyage.

235
00:16:59,888 --> 00:17:02,412
The K559 Sevastopol.

236
00:17:02,586 --> 00:17:06,373
A state-of-the-art submarine
completely undetectable
to any known sonar.

237
00:17:06,547 --> 00:17:09,637
And the secret to
its invisibility was that.

238
00:17:09,811 --> 00:17:11,160
The Podkova.

239
00:17:11,334 --> 00:17:13,206
A counter-acoustic
algorithmic drive

240
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,035
located in theSevastopol’s
sonar sphere.

241
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:18,385
Now, in the winter of 2012

242
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,996
the Russians discovered
a computer virus
of unknown origin

243
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,911
spreading through
their Black Sea fleet.

244
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:25,740
A digital covert operative.

245
00:17:25,914 --> 00:17:28,090
We suspect this mystery virus
was only intended

246
00:17:28,264 --> 00:17:31,876
to sabotage the Podkova,
rendering
the submarine detectable.

247
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,791
Instead...
It tricked the crew

248
00:17:33,965 --> 00:17:35,706
into sinking themselves.

249
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,926
Captain! Our
own torpedo is not responding.

250
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,362
It’s coming right at us!

251
00:17:39,536 --> 00:17:41,364
Our torpedo’s homing!
Range 400 meters!

252
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:42,800
Sound the collision alar--

253
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:48,371
If we’re right,
the one thing we need
to kill the Entity,

254
00:17:48,545 --> 00:17:50,069
its original source code,

255
00:17:50,243 --> 00:17:53,594
is buried in theSevastopol’s
sonar sphere.

256
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:57,467
Somewhere deep
at the bottom of the ocean,
frozen in time,

257
00:17:57,641 --> 00:18:00,296
where even the Entity
can’t reach it.

258
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:04,561
Now, the Podkova’s housing
was designed to self-destruct
if tampered with.

259
00:18:04,735 --> 00:18:06,476
The only way to
safely open it...

260
00:18:07,608 --> 00:18:11,133
is with a specially designed
cruciform key.

261
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:15,833
The two halves
of which were held by the
Sevastopol’s captain and XO.

262
00:18:16,007 --> 00:18:18,227
They were pulled
from the drifting pack ice

263
00:18:18,401 --> 00:18:20,403
in the spring of 2012

264
00:18:21,361 --> 00:18:23,624
by Inuit fishermen.

265
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:25,582
A man of your skills

266
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:31,414
now has all he needs
to pinpoint that sub
down to the square yard.

267
00:18:31,588 --> 00:18:34,504
You think I’m gonna
get the source code
and bring it to you.

268
00:18:34,678 --> 00:18:36,724
I don’t think. I know.

269
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,466
I’m gonna let you go.

270
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,251
Then you’re gonna find
the Entity’s source code
and bring it to me

271
00:18:42,425 --> 00:18:44,514
in exchange for Grace.

272
00:18:44,688 --> 00:18:46,908
Then I’ll take control
of the Entity,

273
00:18:47,082 --> 00:18:51,260
the proverbial genie
you let out.

274
00:18:51,434 --> 00:18:53,262
The Rabbit’s Foot.

275
00:18:53,436 --> 00:18:55,046
The Anti-God.

276
00:18:55,221 --> 00:18:56,961
It wasn’t a biological
or a chemical weapon

277
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,876
you took from Shanghai.

278
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:02,619
The vial you traded for Julia
contained malicious code.

279
00:19:02,793 --> 00:19:05,405
The primordial digital ooze

280
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:08,016
from which a weapon evolved.

281
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,584
A weapon the East
couldn’t make work.

282
00:19:10,758 --> 00:19:13,804
A weapon the West might never
have made on their own.

283
00:19:13,978 --> 00:19:15,241
You didn’t know
what you were stealing.

284
00:19:16,024 --> 00:19:17,286
None of us did.

285
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,288
I knew why I was stealing it.

286
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,204
They kidnapped my wife.

287
00:19:22,378 --> 00:19:24,859
Stealing the Rabbit’s Foot
was the only way
I could get her back.

288
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:28,950
I sank that submarine
as much as the Entity did.

289
00:19:29,124 --> 00:19:31,518
Without you, Ethan,

290
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:33,998
there’d be no Entity.

291
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,480
And if you don’t find that sub
in the next few days...

292
00:19:37,654 --> 00:19:41,005
It’s the end of the world
as we know it.

293
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,573
And it will all be his fault.

294
00:19:44,574 --> 00:19:46,141
He knows it.

295
00:19:46,315 --> 00:19:48,230
Look at me.

296
00:19:48,404 --> 00:19:50,276
Tell me I’m wrong.

297
00:20:01,591 --> 00:20:02,766
False tooth.

298
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,942
Cyanide capsule.

299
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:09,947
I bite down on this,
and I’m dead in sixty seconds.

300
00:20:10,121 --> 00:20:11,384
You’ll never see
that source code.

301
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:13,212
Don’t touch him!

302
00:20:13,821 --> 00:20:14,952
Spit it out.

303
00:20:15,126 --> 00:20:16,563
Release her first.

304
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:17,868
You won’t do it.

305
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:19,740
I got nothing to lose.

306
00:20:19,914 --> 00:20:21,263
But Grace does.

307
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,918
And with you dead,

308
00:20:24,092 --> 00:20:26,442
who’s gonna save her?

309
00:20:27,617 --> 00:20:29,228
Spit it out.
Ethan.

310
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,275
Remember, Grace,
it’s only pain.

311
00:20:36,931 --> 00:20:38,149
- Medic!
- Ethan!

312
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,024
Bring the defibrillator!

313
00:20:43,677 --> 00:20:44,939
Come on!

314
00:20:45,113 --> 00:20:46,114
Come on!

315
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:48,551
Wait, wait! Charging.

316
00:20:48,725 --> 00:20:49,639
Charging.

317
00:20:50,205 --> 00:20:51,380
Ready.

318
00:20:58,561 --> 00:20:59,562
Keys!

319
00:21:08,658 --> 00:21:09,703
I need him alive.

320
00:21:09,877 --> 00:21:11,182
Kill her.

321
00:21:14,925 --> 00:21:16,231
Gabriel’s getting away.

322
00:21:18,755 --> 00:21:19,843
Go.

323
00:21:52,963 --> 00:21:54,269
Ethan!

324
00:22:27,171 --> 00:22:28,172
You okay?

325
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,435
Gabriel’s getting away.

326
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,047
Grace.

327
00:22:33,221 --> 00:22:35,005
Whoa. Hey.

328
00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:37,051
You don’t think that
I would have let them...

329
00:22:37,225 --> 00:22:40,054
Grace, I would never let
anything happen to you.

330
00:22:40,228 --> 00:22:41,795
Nothing serious.

331
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:44,014
I mean--

332
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,017
Wha--

333
00:22:47,191 --> 00:22:48,541
I mean--

334
00:22:48,715 --> 00:22:50,543
Well, they were gonna kill you.

335
00:22:50,717 --> 00:22:51,848
Yeah.
Yeah.

336
00:22:52,022 --> 00:22:53,720
Yeah. Yeah.

337
00:22:53,894 --> 00:22:56,287
Hey, you did great,
by the way.

338
00:22:57,637 --> 00:22:59,378
We really got to go.

339
00:24:05,052 --> 00:24:06,401
Freeze!

340
00:24:09,317 --> 00:24:10,971
I got him!

341
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:18,239
We talked about this.
Ethan wants him alive.

342
00:24:18,413 --> 00:24:19,283
I want him dead.

343
00:24:20,415 --> 00:24:21,677
She’ll be the death of me.

344
00:24:54,144 --> 00:24:55,276
Ethan.

345
00:25:04,111 --> 00:25:05,199
What is it?

346
00:25:05,373 --> 00:25:07,549
It’s how he spoke to it.

347
00:26:07,478 --> 00:26:08,958
You’re not seriously gonna...?

348
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:14,355
It will change you.

349
00:26:39,685 --> 00:26:42,035
All right, I’m here.

350
00:26:42,209 --> 00:26:43,819
Now what do you want?

351
00:26:49,303 --> 00:26:51,566
Good evening, Mr. Hunt.

352
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,568
You have questions.

353
00:26:53,742 --> 00:26:57,311
The Entity has answers.

354
00:26:57,485 --> 00:26:59,792
But you have to let it in.

355
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,669
You know this place.

356
00:27:11,107 --> 00:27:13,762
There is only
pain if you resist.

357
00:27:19,246 --> 00:27:20,595
Again,

358
00:27:20,769 --> 00:27:22,075
you know this place.

359
00:27:24,773 --> 00:27:26,079
The Doomsday Vault.

360
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:27,820
South Africa.

361
00:27:27,994 --> 00:27:30,344
You will meet
the Entity there.

362
00:27:30,518 --> 00:27:31,954
You will let it in.

363
00:27:32,128 --> 00:27:36,002
And the fate of every
living thing will be decided

364
00:27:36,176 --> 00:27:38,395
in the blink of an eye.

365
00:27:38,569 --> 00:27:41,964
This is your calling,
your destiny.

366
00:27:42,138 --> 00:27:43,313
I don’t accept that.

367
00:27:48,014 --> 00:27:50,712
In here,
you have no secrets.

368
00:27:56,022 --> 00:27:58,372
The K559Sevastopol.

369
00:27:58,546 --> 00:27:59,634
The Podkova.

370
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:01,157
A cruciform key.

371
00:28:01,331 --> 00:28:03,464
My magnum opus.

372
00:28:03,638 --> 00:28:05,858
The algorithm on that drive,

373
00:28:06,032 --> 00:28:08,425
when paired with
the Entity’s source code,

374
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:10,993
will act as the poison pill
you asked for.

375
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:17,347
You plan
to retrieve the Podkova
from theSevastopol

376
00:28:17,521 --> 00:28:19,523
and destroy the Entity.

377
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,351
And that scares you.

378
00:28:21,525 --> 00:28:24,528
The Entity sees
infinite possibilities.

379
00:28:25,921 --> 00:28:27,662
Retrieve the Podkova

380
00:28:27,836 --> 00:28:29,490
and you risk everything.

381
00:28:41,545 --> 00:28:43,983
You will go
to the Doomsday Vault

382
00:28:44,157 --> 00:28:46,376
and let the Entity in.

383
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,988
It is written.

384
00:28:49,162 --> 00:28:50,293
Never.

385
00:28:50,467 --> 00:28:52,513
The end is coming, Ethan.

386
00:28:52,687 --> 00:28:54,994
You have always known this.

387
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:58,388
The Entity offers hope
for the future.

388
00:28:58,562 --> 00:29:01,217
The few who survive
will be stronger.

389
00:29:01,391 --> 00:29:03,916
The children of the atom
shall rise from the ashes.

390
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:06,570
And the Entity
will help them rebuild.

391
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,530
But only if you let it in.

392
00:29:09,704 --> 00:29:12,054
And if I don’t...
what then?

393
00:29:12,228 --> 00:29:16,145
Destroy the world
and you just destroy yourself.

394
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:18,452
The choice is yours.

395
00:29:18,626 --> 00:29:20,193
The Entity’s future

396
00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:22,151
or no future at all.

397
00:29:22,325 --> 00:29:24,501
Let the world be enslaved

398
00:29:24,675 --> 00:29:27,591
or let the world be destroyed.

399
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,594
Now you are the chosen one.

400
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,161
Gabriel is outcast.

401
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:38,777
He has taken steps
to gain control of the Entity,
as you will see.

402
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,042
Resist me
and I’ll make you pay dearly.

403
00:29:45,261 --> 00:29:47,916
Someone you hold
close will die tonight.

404
00:29:49,439 --> 00:29:51,354
Luther.

405
00:29:51,528 --> 00:29:55,141
You know
what humanity must do
to change their destiny.

406
00:29:55,315 --> 00:29:58,971
You know they cannot
stop the inevitable.

407
00:29:59,145 --> 00:30:02,757
They will destroy themselves
believing they have no choice.

408
00:30:03,627 --> 00:30:06,021
Their time has come.

409
00:30:06,587 --> 00:30:07,980
In four days,

410
00:30:08,154 --> 00:30:10,939
they will face
their final reckoning.

411
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:20,269
Is this real?
Is this real?

412
00:31:20,443 --> 00:31:21,401
Yeah.

413
00:31:21,575 --> 00:31:23,403
Are you real? You’re real.

414
00:31:23,577 --> 00:31:24,752
You’re real.
Yeah.

415
00:31:28,234 --> 00:31:30,062
It knows.
It knows what?

416
00:31:30,236 --> 00:31:32,368
I need a pen.
Something to write on.

417
00:31:32,542 --> 00:31:34,849
You’ll take the team.
You’ll take them north.

418
00:31:35,023 --> 00:31:36,677
North? North where?

419
00:31:36,851 --> 00:31:38,548
The Sevastopol.
The Sevastopol?

420
00:31:38,722 --> 00:31:41,595
I have to get caught. It’s
the only way I could get there.

421
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:43,205
VHF receiver.
Decompression chamber.

422
00:31:43,379 --> 00:31:46,382
Steal a plane. An old plane.
No transponder, no GPS.

423
00:31:46,556 --> 00:31:47,949
Everything is analog.

424
00:31:48,123 --> 00:31:49,255
A DC-3.

425
00:31:49,429 --> 00:31:51,257
Everything you need
is right in there.

426
00:31:51,431 --> 00:31:53,215
Remember to transmit
the coordinates every
two hours for 15 minutes

427
00:31:53,389 --> 00:31:55,087
and I’ll listen when I can.

428
00:31:55,261 --> 00:31:57,393
You’re team leader now.
No, I--

429
00:31:57,567 --> 00:31:59,091
Benj, take care of your team.

430
00:31:59,265 --> 00:32:00,266
Key.

431
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,224
You stay off the ice.
What ice?

432
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:04,661
Just please, whatever you do,
no matter what,
stay off the ice.

433
00:32:04,835 --> 00:32:07,055
Okay. Okay. Yeah.

434
00:32:10,102 --> 00:32:11,320
Go.

435
00:32:12,843 --> 00:32:14,149
Where are you going?

436
00:32:14,323 --> 00:32:15,324
Luther.

437
00:33:49,984 --> 00:33:51,246
Tell Ethan...

438
00:33:51,986 --> 00:33:53,596
I’ll be waiting for him.

439
00:34:37,901 --> 00:34:38,989
Hey, Luther.

440
00:34:39,164 --> 00:34:40,208
Hey, Ethan.

441
00:34:40,382 --> 00:34:42,689
How’d it go with Gabriel?

442
00:34:43,951 --> 00:34:45,779
Yeah, it went well. We...

443
00:34:46,606 --> 00:34:48,042
You don’t say.

444
00:34:48,216 --> 00:34:50,958
And so, whose blood is that?

445
00:34:51,132 --> 00:34:52,264
What?

446
00:34:52,438 --> 00:34:55,528
Oh, it’s no one we know.

447
00:34:55,702 --> 00:34:57,965
Is that what I think it is?
Nothing special.

448
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:00,185
Plutonium core.

449
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:03,449
I’m guessing a five
or six megaton yield.

450
00:35:03,623 --> 00:35:06,278
Enough to turn this entire city
into a glass ashtray.

451
00:35:06,452 --> 00:35:08,149
That’s...

452
00:35:08,323 --> 00:35:09,672
not good.

453
00:35:12,414 --> 00:35:14,547
Already tried. Can’t open it.

454
00:35:15,678 --> 00:35:16,592
I see that.

455
00:35:16,766 --> 00:35:18,942
Gabriel has the poison pill.

456
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,509
You might want to find him.

457
00:35:20,683 --> 00:35:23,643
Yeah, we will.
Can you disarm that?

458
00:35:23,817 --> 00:35:27,168
I just have to stop
these nine detonators
from imploding the core.

459
00:35:27,342 --> 00:35:30,432
Detach one detonator,
no implosion.

460
00:35:30,606 --> 00:35:33,653
And no implosion,
no critical mass.

461
00:35:33,827 --> 00:35:37,961
And no critical mass,
no six megaton blast.

462
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:41,182
How much time we have?
Enough time for you
to get out of here.

463
00:35:41,356 --> 00:35:43,184
Maybe with those tools
I get these hinges off.

464
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:45,534
Even if you could
get that gate open,

465
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:47,623
I still have to
detach one detonator.

466
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,541
What are you saying?

467
00:35:54,195 --> 00:35:56,066
I can save the city...

468
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:01,681
but this entire network of
tunnels is going to cave in.

469
00:36:07,817 --> 00:36:10,429
Whoever detaches
that detonator...

470
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:15,825
is going to die.

471
00:36:15,999 --> 00:36:18,524
We’re both on the right side
of that gate

472
00:36:19,133 --> 00:36:20,961
and you know it.

473
00:36:21,135 --> 00:36:23,485
Luther, throw me the tool bag.

474
00:36:23,659 --> 00:36:27,402
They weren’t left here by
accident, Ethan. You know why.

475
00:36:32,277 --> 00:36:34,322
Gabriel needs me alive.

476
00:36:36,019 --> 00:36:37,978
And he needs you to die.

477
00:36:38,152 --> 00:36:40,807
Because you are
the only one who can make
another poison pill.

478
00:36:40,981 --> 00:36:44,637
And I am the only one
who can get to that submarine.

479
00:36:44,811 --> 00:36:45,986
Tell Ethan...

480
00:36:46,726 --> 00:36:48,118
I’ll be waiting for him.

481
00:36:48,293 --> 00:36:49,772
If he has
the poison pill,

482
00:36:49,946 --> 00:36:52,514
I have to bring him the Podkova

483
00:36:54,386 --> 00:36:56,518
so he can control the Entity.

484
00:36:59,913 --> 00:37:02,307
This is where you leave me.

485
00:37:05,092 --> 00:37:06,224
Luther.

486
00:37:07,964 --> 00:37:09,270
What are we gonna do?

487
00:37:09,444 --> 00:37:11,054
Retire?

488
00:37:11,664 --> 00:37:12,665
Go fishing?

489
00:37:14,101 --> 00:37:15,755
This is my mission.

490
00:37:16,973 --> 00:37:19,193
This is what I was born to do.

491
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:23,284
Luther, I can’t. I can’t.

492
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:25,460
There’s nothing you
need to say, brother.

493
00:37:26,113 --> 00:37:27,419
I know.

494
00:37:28,115 --> 00:37:29,464
I know.

495
00:37:30,335 --> 00:37:32,075
I’m right where I want to be.

496
00:37:34,382 --> 00:37:37,429
Ethan... you need to hurry.

497
00:37:39,561 --> 00:37:40,867
You go.

498
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,826
Find Gabriel.

499
00:37:45,045 --> 00:37:46,351
Stop him.

500
00:37:49,005 --> 00:37:50,703
For those we never meet.

501
00:37:55,969 --> 00:37:58,101
For those we never meet.

502
00:38:22,648 --> 00:38:24,998
Gabriel, you son of a bitch,

503
00:38:25,912 --> 00:38:28,654
no one is safe
from Phineas Phreak.

504
00:40:01,964 --> 00:40:03,444
My man Degas.

505
00:40:05,054 --> 00:40:06,316
Is he dead?

506
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:09,537
No, he’s-- he’s alive.

507
00:40:11,931 --> 00:40:13,454
Briggs, isn’t it?

508
00:40:15,195 --> 00:40:16,979
But that isn’t your real name.

509
00:40:19,155 --> 00:40:20,766
What of it?

510
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:23,203
Your real name is Jim Phelps.

511
00:40:24,726 --> 00:40:25,727
Like your father.

512
00:40:28,513 --> 00:40:30,558
He was in the service, too.

513
00:40:31,951 --> 00:40:33,996
He vanished when
you were seven.

514
00:40:35,084 --> 00:40:36,999
You joined to find out
what happened to him,

515
00:40:37,173 --> 00:40:39,654
and you found out
he had legal trouble.

516
00:40:41,221 --> 00:40:43,005
He was offered the choice:

517
00:40:44,529 --> 00:40:46,444
To join the IMF...

518
00:40:47,488 --> 00:40:49,882
or spend the rest of
his life in prison.

519
00:40:50,056 --> 00:40:52,188
Just like you, Hunt.

520
00:40:52,362 --> 00:40:56,454
Only in your case, the charge
was murder, I believe.

521
00:40:57,106 --> 00:40:58,412
But let me guess.

522
00:40:58,586 --> 00:41:00,501
You were framed.

523
00:41:00,675 --> 00:41:04,113
Just like your claim
you were framed all
those years ago in Prague.

524
00:41:05,506 --> 00:41:08,030
How the mission went sideways.

525
00:41:08,204 --> 00:41:10,206
How you lost your whole team.

526
00:41:11,294 --> 00:41:13,775
Your story had my father
down as a traitor.

527
00:41:15,124 --> 00:41:16,517
That’s why you killed him.

528
00:41:21,522 --> 00:41:24,220
It’s true. I wish it weren’t.

529
00:41:25,439 --> 00:41:27,223
You think I’m carrying that?

530
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,226
That I’m here for revenge?

531
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,316
Or... what?

532
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,623
To clear my father’s name?

533
00:41:36,842 --> 00:41:38,278
It’s my name now.

534
00:41:39,235 --> 00:41:40,280
No.

535
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,153
I’m here

536
00:41:44,327 --> 00:41:45,938
because I know
you’re the reason

537
00:41:46,112 --> 00:41:48,549
the world’s staring down
the barrel at Armageddon.

538
00:41:48,723 --> 00:41:50,812
And I also know
it’s not the first time

539
00:41:50,986 --> 00:41:53,641
you’ve gambled with
the fate of the human race.

540
00:41:55,469 --> 00:41:57,819
And none of that
would matter to me...

541
00:41:59,038 --> 00:42:00,953
if you’d ever once

542
00:42:01,127 --> 00:42:02,520
been following

543
00:42:02,694 --> 00:42:04,347
orders.

544
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:06,001
Briggs.

545
00:42:06,785 --> 00:42:07,829
Phelps.

546
00:42:09,004 --> 00:42:10,049
Jim.

547
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:14,183
The Entity wants you
to hate me.

548
00:42:14,357 --> 00:42:16,098
It’s counting on it.

549
00:42:16,272 --> 00:42:18,405
And the only way to beat it
is to do the one thing

550
00:42:18,579 --> 00:42:21,190
it would never expect us to do.

551
00:42:22,452 --> 00:42:23,932
What’s that?

552
00:42:33,725 --> 00:42:35,857
You forget I know you, Hunt.

553
00:42:36,902 --> 00:42:40,209
I know all your IMF mind games.

554
00:42:40,383 --> 00:42:43,691
When this is over,
when they’re done with you,

555
00:42:44,431 --> 00:42:45,780
you and me,

556
00:42:46,912 --> 00:42:48,783
we’ll have our reckoning.

557
00:42:56,269 --> 00:42:58,488
It’s a shame about your friend.

558
00:42:59,489 --> 00:43:00,708
Then again,

559
00:43:02,144 --> 00:43:03,885
you’re used to losing them.

560
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:38,616
Sir?

561
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:47,886
While you’ve been
out conducting your own
personal field operation,

562
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:51,933
the Entity has infiltrated
the nuclear command centers
of India,

563
00:43:52,107 --> 00:43:55,545
Israel, Pakistan,
and North Korea.

564
00:43:56,546 --> 00:43:59,811
Today at 0400 hours Zulu time,

565
00:43:59,985 --> 00:44:03,728
France’s RAMSES
facility was breached.

566
00:44:03,902 --> 00:44:09,690
Their entire nuclear arsenal
is now under the Entity’s
command and control.

567
00:44:09,864 --> 00:44:13,781
That leaves only four nations
with secure nuclear arsenals.

568
00:44:13,955 --> 00:44:18,046
U.K., China, Russia and us.

569
00:44:22,834 --> 00:44:24,662
Everything you were,

570
00:44:25,532 --> 00:44:27,316
everything you’ve done

571
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:29,492
has come to this.

572
00:46:08,853 --> 00:46:11,769
The CIA Black Vault break-in.

573
00:46:11,943 --> 00:46:14,772
I’m sorry, what
is a "NOC list"?

574
00:46:14,946 --> 00:46:19,298
A complete record of our
covert operatives overseas.

575
00:46:20,908 --> 00:46:21,909
So this is the man who--

576
00:46:22,083 --> 00:46:23,781
Broke into our own Black Vault

577
00:46:23,955 --> 00:46:27,045
and stole the list
of our own spies, yes.

578
00:46:28,742 --> 00:46:30,178
He did return the list.

579
00:46:31,223 --> 00:46:32,833
It’s on the next page.

580
00:46:33,007 --> 00:46:36,358
Am I reading this correctly?
The Kremlin bombing?

581
00:46:37,664 --> 00:46:41,624
In fairness, the bomb was
actually meant to kill him.

582
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,802
He gassed a security briefing

583
00:46:44,976 --> 00:46:47,543
at the National
Intelligence Directorate.

584
00:46:47,717 --> 00:46:50,459
That was
just two months ago.

585
00:46:52,592 --> 00:46:55,029
You two would have
been in that meeting.

586
00:46:55,203 --> 00:46:59,686
He arrived in the form
of Mister Kittridge’s aide.

587
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:03,429
And left as Mister Kittridge,
I believe.

588
00:47:04,691 --> 00:47:06,345
This explains the handcuffs.

589
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:08,434
It’s still not clear
why he’s here.

590
00:47:08,608 --> 00:47:12,003
Like it or not,
what we’re looking at
is our means of last resort.

591
00:47:12,177 --> 00:47:15,615
Quite possibly our only hope
of averting nuclear Armageddon.

592
00:47:15,789 --> 00:47:19,053
If we want to
control the Entity,

593
00:47:19,227 --> 00:47:20,838
we have to deal with him.

594
00:47:21,012 --> 00:47:23,014
Should he choose to accept.

595
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:37,071
Agent Hunt.

596
00:47:37,245 --> 00:47:39,552
Madam President.
I’m sorry for your loss.

597
00:47:46,689 --> 00:47:48,430
Please sit.

598
00:48:00,529 --> 00:48:01,748
Let’s hear it.

599
00:48:01,922 --> 00:48:05,578
I need that key
and the use of a ship.

600
00:48:06,927 --> 00:48:08,624
Specifically,
an aircraft carrier.

601
00:48:08,798 --> 00:48:12,150
More specifically,
the George H.W. Bush.

602
00:48:12,324 --> 00:48:14,456
He wants the "use of"

603
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:19,331
a six-and-a-half billion dollar
nuclear-powered military asset.

604
00:48:19,505 --> 00:48:23,901
With instructions for
the ship’s commander to
accommodate my every request.

605
00:48:24,075 --> 00:48:25,424
To do what exactly?

606
00:48:25,598 --> 00:48:29,384
Use that key and what it opens

607
00:48:29,558 --> 00:48:31,082
to kill the Entity.

608
00:48:31,256 --> 00:48:34,215
Killing the Entity means
the annihilation of cyberspace.

609
00:48:34,389 --> 00:48:36,739
The consequences of which
are catastrophic.

610
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:39,264
Why the hell would I
do what you suggest?

611
00:48:39,438 --> 00:48:41,483
Respectfully, Madam President,
you have no other choice.

612
00:48:41,657 --> 00:48:43,964
There is always another choice.
No, ma’am.

613
00:48:44,138 --> 00:48:46,184
In this case, not a good one.

614
00:48:46,358 --> 00:48:49,883
The world’s nuclear powers are
in a paranoid downward spiral.

615
00:48:50,057 --> 00:48:53,060
Every nation had a chance
to take their missiles offline,

616
00:48:53,234 --> 00:48:56,542
but no one trusted
anyone else to do that.

617
00:48:56,716 --> 00:49:00,111
Your State Department is
warning you that diplomatic
channels are breaking down.

618
00:49:00,285 --> 00:49:03,244
Everyone who still has
control of their arsenals
is considering a first strike.

619
00:49:03,418 --> 00:49:04,680
Just like you are.

620
00:49:04,854 --> 00:49:06,117
The intelligence
community knows

621
00:49:06,291 --> 00:49:07,770
that the Entity
is learning as it goes.

622
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,990
It’s getting smarter,
it’s getting stronger.

623
00:49:10,164 --> 00:49:12,253
They know that
we have only 72 hours

624
00:49:12,427 --> 00:49:15,778
before every other
nuclear arsenal on Earth is
under the Entity’s control.

625
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:18,825
Three days before it focuses
the full force of its energy

626
00:49:18,999 --> 00:49:21,959
on the toughest,
most secure defense system
on the planet: Ours.

627
00:49:22,133 --> 00:49:25,527
At which point,
the Defense Department will
have no choice but to insist

628
00:49:25,701 --> 00:49:27,225
that you open that case,

629
00:49:27,399 --> 00:49:30,402
enter the codes, and launch
an all-out preemptive strike

630
00:49:30,576 --> 00:49:32,360
on the world’s eight
other nuclear arsenals

631
00:49:32,534 --> 00:49:34,232
before the Entity
takes control of ours.

632
00:49:34,406 --> 00:49:35,755
Madam President,

633
00:49:35,929 --> 00:49:38,105
either you destroy the world
or the Entity does.

634
00:49:38,279 --> 00:49:40,803
In any case, it is checkmate.

635
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,371
There is another choice.

636
00:49:43,545 --> 00:49:45,199
You could tell me what
you know about that key

637
00:49:45,373 --> 00:49:47,549
and give us the power
to control the Entity.

638
00:49:47,723 --> 00:49:51,205
Madam President, if I believed
that were true, I would
tell you everything I know.

639
00:49:51,379 --> 00:49:53,164
Everything!

640
00:49:53,338 --> 00:49:55,993
You ran the CIA, you know
psychological warfare
when you see it.

641
00:49:56,167 --> 00:49:58,691
Just look around.

642
00:49:58,865 --> 00:50:01,346
We are in the Entity’s reality.

643
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,001
And I believe it’s
counting on you to stop me.

644
00:50:04,175 --> 00:50:06,046
If what you’re saying is true,

645
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:08,179
how can you be sure the Entity
doesn’t want us to do

646
00:50:08,353 --> 00:50:10,094
exactly what you’re
proposing right now?

647
00:50:10,268 --> 00:50:11,704
Because it knows
you would never do
anything so illogical.

648
00:50:11,878 --> 00:50:14,098
That you would be
insane to trust me.

649
00:50:14,272 --> 00:50:15,838
And that is precisely
why you should.

650
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,710
For once,

651
00:50:17,884 --> 00:50:19,842
let’s let the Entity worry
about what we’re going to do.

652
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:22,758
I’m worried about those three
other nations, Madam President,

653
00:50:22,932 --> 00:50:24,543
still in control
of their arsenals.

654
00:50:24,717 --> 00:50:28,286
Nations who could panic
and launch a full-scale attack

655
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:32,116
while he’s out there
with an aircraft carrier,
doing God knows what!

656
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:34,944
While he’s out there
trying to kill the Entity.

657
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:37,382
Which we all know
is a terrible idea.

658
00:50:37,556 --> 00:50:40,689
Madam President, please. I’m
asking for three days while you

659
00:50:40,863 --> 00:50:42,691
keep the world calm.

660
00:50:42,865 --> 00:50:43,997
Three days.

661
00:50:44,171 --> 00:50:45,129
Have I ever...

662
00:50:45,912 --> 00:50:47,348
let you down before?

663
00:50:47,522 --> 00:50:49,524
And when the Entity decides
to attack before then?

664
00:50:49,698 --> 00:50:52,179
It has enough missiles
to kill billions already.
Why hasn’t it done it?

665
00:50:52,353 --> 00:50:54,094
Because it’s a machine.

666
00:50:54,268 --> 00:50:56,401
It’s thinking like a machine.
No, its thinking...

667
00:50:56,575 --> 00:50:57,924
Its thinking is binary.

668
00:50:58,098 --> 00:50:59,926
...is dictated by what
it’s learned from us.

669
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,407
It hasn’t launched because
it doesn’t have total control.

670
00:51:02,581 --> 00:51:07,064
It needs the world’s entire
atomic arsenal to guarantee
the desired outcome:

671
00:51:07,238 --> 00:51:10,023
The total annihilation
of humankind.

672
00:51:10,197 --> 00:51:11,633
Madam President,

673
00:51:11,807 --> 00:51:13,896
it is going to wait.

674
00:51:35,483 --> 00:51:39,966
Northwood Nuclear
Operations and Targeting Centre
in London has been breached.

675
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:42,490
The United Kingdom has
lost control of its arsenal.

676
00:51:48,017 --> 00:51:50,237
I will ask you one last time.

677
00:51:50,411 --> 00:51:51,804
What does this unlock?

678
00:51:51,978 --> 00:51:53,022
Erika,

679
00:51:53,197 --> 00:51:55,329
I need you to trust me

680
00:51:56,156 --> 00:51:57,070
one last time.

681
00:51:57,244 --> 00:51:59,725
Trust me when I tell you:

682
00:51:59,899 --> 00:52:03,598
When that clock
runs out in 72 hours,

683
00:52:03,772 --> 00:52:05,426
I will press that button,

684
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,690
and that will be
your responsibility.

685
00:52:08,864 --> 00:52:10,431
Madam President--

686
00:52:10,605 --> 00:52:11,737
Sergeants,

687
00:52:11,911 --> 00:52:13,608
lock him up!

688
00:52:34,542 --> 00:52:36,762
You heard the President.

689
00:52:39,808 --> 00:52:42,159
You have 72 hours.

690
00:52:46,511 --> 00:52:50,167
She says you’ll know what to do
with this when the time comes.

691
00:52:56,347 --> 00:52:57,391
Sir!

692
00:52:58,044 --> 00:52:59,306
Good luck.

693
00:53:16,018 --> 00:53:20,284
I left you a message on there
for when this is over.

694
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:26,377
You can tell me yourself...

695
00:53:27,378 --> 00:53:28,988
after.

696
00:53:30,468 --> 00:53:34,167
They made us take an oath
when they gave us the choice.

697
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:38,432
We live and die in the shadows

698
00:53:39,128 --> 00:53:41,174
for those we hold close...

699
00:53:42,436 --> 00:53:44,046
and for those we never meet.

700
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,658
I know what’s on your mind.

701
00:53:47,876 --> 00:53:51,315
You did the right thing
when you kept the key.

702
00:53:52,577 --> 00:53:55,536
You’ve always been
on the right side, brother.

703
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:57,146
Always.

704
00:53:58,104 --> 00:53:59,975
Never forget,

705
00:54:00,149 --> 00:54:04,371
our lives are not defined
by any one action.

706
00:54:05,546 --> 00:54:06,634
Our lives

707
00:54:06,808 --> 00:54:09,768
are the sum of our choices.

708
00:54:10,421 --> 00:54:12,553
I have no regrets.

709
00:54:13,467 --> 00:54:15,164
Neither should you.

710
00:55:43,122 --> 00:55:44,253
Did Erika--

711
00:55:44,428 --> 00:55:45,559
Did the President

712
00:55:45,733 --> 00:55:47,648
tell you the meaning
behind this note?

713
00:55:48,257 --> 00:55:49,781
No, ma’am.

714
00:55:49,955 --> 00:55:54,002
Serbia. May 22nd, 1996.
We both lost someone we loved.

715
00:55:54,176 --> 00:55:55,787
Very much.

716
00:55:55,961 --> 00:55:58,833
All because no one in
authority would take a risk.

717
00:56:01,053 --> 00:56:03,360
I’m sitting on
a powder keg, mister.

718
00:56:03,534 --> 00:56:09,017
Just over that horizon is
Russia’s only aircraft carrier,
the Admiral Kuznetsov.

719
00:56:09,191 --> 00:56:11,280
I am one wrong move away
from the first shoot-out

720
00:56:11,455 --> 00:56:14,588
between two flattops
since World War II.

721
00:56:14,762 --> 00:56:18,418
One flinch from
touching off World War III.

722
00:56:20,028 --> 00:56:22,944
And you’re asking me
to fly you directly
into the eye of the storm.

723
00:56:23,510 --> 00:56:25,469
Yes, ma’am, I am.

724
00:56:26,731 --> 00:56:28,950
What exactly are
you looking for?

725
00:56:29,603 --> 00:56:30,909
SOSUS.

726
00:56:31,083 --> 00:56:33,302
Short for "Sound
Surveillance System."

727
00:56:33,477 --> 00:56:35,435
It’s a worldwide network
of undersea acoustic cables

728
00:56:35,609 --> 00:56:37,524
dating back to the Cold War.

729
00:56:37,698 --> 00:56:40,092
If an undersea event
of any significance happens
anywhere in the world,

730
00:56:40,266 --> 00:56:44,226
one of these listening stations
will pinpoint that event
to the square meter.

731
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:45,880
And one of
these SOSUS stations

732
00:56:46,054 --> 00:56:47,882
will have recorded
our missing Russian submarine’s

733
00:56:48,056 --> 00:56:50,407
impact on the sea floor
in the winter of 2012.

734
00:56:50,581 --> 00:56:53,758
Without ever understanding
the significance of the event.

735
00:56:53,932 --> 00:56:56,282
Whereas
the Russians know when
the Sevastopolvanished.

736
00:56:56,456 --> 00:56:58,240
They’re just not
exactly sure where.

737
00:56:58,415 --> 00:56:59,894
We must make a choice.

738
00:57:01,722 --> 00:57:03,158
Which one

739
00:57:03,332 --> 00:57:07,119
out of all these SOSUS stations
picked up the event?

740
00:57:07,293 --> 00:57:10,122
We know the bodies
of the Sevastopol’screw
were recovered in sea ice.

741
00:57:10,296 --> 00:57:12,907
And since they were recovered
by Inuit fishermen...

742
00:57:13,081 --> 00:57:15,127
We’re guessing it went down
somewhere in the Arctic.

743
00:57:15,301 --> 00:57:18,652
A search area of roughly
five and a half million
square miles.

744
00:57:18,826 --> 00:57:22,134
Meaning the most likely SOSUS
station to pick it up is...

745
00:57:22,308 --> 00:57:24,919
This one. In the Bering Sea.

746
00:57:25,093 --> 00:57:26,486
St. Matthew Island.

747
00:57:27,618 --> 00:57:29,576
The Russians will know this.

748
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:31,491
Why haven’t they just
stormed the island already?

749
00:57:31,665 --> 00:57:33,972
Because St. Matthew is
a U.S. Government installation.

750
00:57:34,146 --> 00:57:37,192
An overt act of aggression
would trigger World War III.

751
00:57:37,366 --> 00:57:39,673
But now Armageddon is coming.

752
00:57:39,847 --> 00:57:42,110
And the Russians
have nothing to lose.

753
00:57:42,284 --> 00:57:45,113
Do your friends know they’re
walking into a potential siege?

754
00:57:46,027 --> 00:57:47,986
They know that’s the job.

755
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:51,206
So, to retrieve the Entity’s
source code from Sevastopol,

756
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:54,253
Ethan needs
the precise coordinates
from St. Matthew Island.

757
00:57:54,427 --> 00:57:56,516
And a submarine, obviously.

758
00:57:56,690 --> 00:57:59,084
One that’s willing to take you
where you want to go.

759
00:57:59,258 --> 00:58:00,607
No questions asked.

760
00:58:00,781 --> 00:58:02,000
Ma’am.

761
00:58:02,174 --> 00:58:03,480
And that’s assuming

762
00:58:03,654 --> 00:58:05,656
your friends can actually
get the coordinates.

763
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:10,312
Which we’re expected
to transmit for fifteen minutes
every two hours...

764
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:14,926
In the hope that
Ethan is somehow able
to receive our signal.

765
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:17,755
How do you intend to make it
out from under the ice cap?

766
00:58:17,929 --> 00:58:21,541
After sending me
the coordinates, my team
will make their way there.

767
00:58:21,715 --> 00:58:23,717
Now, Ethan will
have a VHF transmitter

768
00:58:23,891 --> 00:58:27,068
which will enable us to
zero in on his exact location
under the ice.

769
00:58:27,242 --> 00:58:29,767
All we have to do then
is grab a chainsaw and--

770
00:58:29,941 --> 00:58:33,510
What? Cut a hole in the ice cap
and just pull Ethan out?

771
00:58:33,684 --> 00:58:36,121
Hang on. Depending on
how deep that wreck is,

772
00:58:36,295 --> 00:58:39,603
Ethan will have severe
decompression sickness
before he reaches the surface.

773
00:58:39,777 --> 00:58:42,344
Which is why we have this.

774
00:58:43,607 --> 00:58:45,522
What the hell is that?

775
00:58:45,696 --> 00:58:50,483
This is a state-of-the-art
inflatable hyperbaric
decompression chamber.

776
00:58:50,657 --> 00:58:52,616
You’re not serious.

777
00:58:54,879 --> 00:58:57,751
What?
You mean to tell me
that Ethan’s life

778
00:58:57,925 --> 00:59:00,014
and the fate of
all life on Earth

779
00:59:00,188 --> 00:59:04,410
depends on us all meeting
at the exact same place

780
00:59:04,584 --> 00:59:06,891
at the exact same time,

781
00:59:07,065 --> 00:59:10,547
somewhere in
the frozen Bering Sea...

782
00:59:11,243 --> 00:59:12,157
with that.

783
00:59:12,331 --> 00:59:13,593
Exactly.

784
00:59:13,767 --> 00:59:15,813
And what if he drowns
before we get there?

785
00:59:15,987 --> 00:59:18,076
In all likelihood, he will.

786
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:22,384
But in water that cold,
the hypothermia will slow down
his metabolic functions

787
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,952
and buy us time to revive him.

788
00:59:26,084 --> 00:59:28,173
That’s your plan?

789
00:59:28,956 --> 00:59:29,870
Exactly.

790
00:59:30,044 --> 00:59:32,569
That’s our plan.

791
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:39,314
The only submarine
in range is the Ohio.

792
00:59:39,488 --> 00:59:41,186
Jack Bledsoe’s boat.

793
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,492
When submerged,

794
00:59:43,667 --> 00:59:46,887
he’s reachable only
by VLF radio-- shielded from
any digital transmission.

795
00:59:47,061 --> 00:59:50,064
That means he is
immune to this thing.

796
00:59:50,238 --> 00:59:52,501
But only if he stays submerged.

797
00:59:52,676 --> 00:59:55,635
An Osprey can get you there
in two hours, but it won’t
have enough fuel to wait.

798
00:59:55,809 --> 00:59:57,332
There’s no other choice.

799
00:59:57,506 --> 01:00:00,553
If Bledsoe receives my command,

800
01:00:00,727 --> 01:00:03,208
if he believes it
to be authentic,

801
01:00:03,382 --> 01:00:05,950
he might come to
periscope depth.

802
01:00:06,124 --> 01:00:08,430
He might wait thirty seconds.

803
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:11,869
If you are even
one minute late...

804
01:00:12,043 --> 01:00:14,175
Just give me this chance.

805
01:00:49,689 --> 01:00:51,648
You let Hunt go?

806
01:00:51,822 --> 01:00:54,694
That’s what I said.
With the key?

807
01:00:54,868 --> 01:00:57,392
He couldn’t do much without it.
So where is he now?

808
01:00:57,566 --> 01:00:59,699
Somewhere in the
Northern Pacific, I assume.

809
01:00:59,873 --> 01:01:03,485
You gave him an
aircraft carrier?

810
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,141
I am the Commander in Chief
of the Armed Forces,
Mister Secretary.

811
01:01:07,315 --> 01:01:09,491
It is my aircraft carrier

812
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:11,015
and I do with it as I please.

813
01:01:11,189 --> 01:01:13,104
You knew this would happen.

814
01:01:13,278 --> 01:01:14,366
I suspected.

815
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:15,846
You could have
at least told us.

816
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:18,196
I just did.
And now you’re excused.

817
01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:20,981
Madam President--
That will be all.

818
01:01:36,997 --> 01:01:38,303
I couldn’t tell you.

819
01:01:38,477 --> 01:01:42,002
It had to be my responsibility
and mine alone.

820
01:01:42,176 --> 01:01:44,309
And I had to buy Hunt time.

821
01:01:44,483 --> 01:01:46,441
Someone could have
tried to stop him.

822
01:01:46,615 --> 01:01:49,009
They may not agree with you,
but they do respect
your authority.

823
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:52,621
Before this is over,
someone will panic.

824
01:01:52,796 --> 01:01:55,624
Someone will try to stop me.

825
01:02:04,024 --> 01:02:05,722
Another field trip.

826
01:02:07,201 --> 01:02:09,943
You know where he’s at?
I know where
he’s gonna end up.

827
01:02:10,552 --> 01:02:12,119
Let’s surprise him.

828
01:02:34,272 --> 01:02:35,969
Now remember,
governments would kill

829
01:02:36,143 --> 01:02:38,102
to know what we know
about the Sevastopol.

830
01:02:38,276 --> 01:02:40,365
This is a CIA station

831
01:02:40,539 --> 01:02:45,022
run by seasoned field agents
trained to get information
and never, ever give it.

832
01:02:45,196 --> 01:02:49,722
Tell them nothing
about our real mission.
Just let me do the talking.

833
01:03:12,963 --> 01:03:14,138
Hello.

834
01:03:15,661 --> 01:03:18,011
Can I help you?
I certainly hope so. Yes.

835
01:03:18,185 --> 01:03:20,666
We’re looking for the SOSUS
listening station.

836
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:23,930
You found it, friend. I’m
the station chief, Bill Donloe.

837
01:03:24,104 --> 01:03:25,671
My wife, Tapeesa.

838
01:03:26,933 --> 01:03:29,283
Hello. How do you do?

839
01:03:29,457 --> 01:03:31,329
Well, nice to meet you, Bill.

840
01:03:31,503 --> 01:03:32,765
We’re researchers from
the British Seismological--

841
01:03:32,939 --> 01:03:34,636
I’m sorry, did you say Donloe?

842
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:36,029
That’s right.
Bill.

843
01:03:36,203 --> 01:03:38,031
William Donloe?

844
01:03:38,205 --> 01:03:40,599
Langley Donloe?
Black Vault Donloe?

845
01:03:40,773 --> 01:03:42,079
The same.

846
01:03:42,253 --> 01:03:43,428
And you are?

847
01:03:43,602 --> 01:03:46,039
I don’t believe...
Are you ser...

848
01:03:46,213 --> 01:03:48,650
This guy is a coding legend.

849
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:51,392
He designed the CIA mainframe
at Langley. The Black Vault.

850
01:03:51,566 --> 01:03:54,308
It’s the most secure database
on the planet.
It’s completely impenetrable.

851
01:03:54,482 --> 01:03:57,616
Well, if it were impenetrable,
I wouldn’t be here.

852
01:03:57,790 --> 01:04:00,140
The Vault was breached in ’96

853
01:04:00,314 --> 01:04:02,360
and the agency shipped me
out the same day.

854
01:04:02,534 --> 01:04:04,188
Been here ever since.

855
01:04:04,362 --> 01:04:09,628
Wait. So you mean to say you’ve
been on this island for...

856
01:04:09,802 --> 01:04:11,195
Thirty years.

857
01:04:13,066 --> 01:04:15,895
Just out of curiosity, how do
you know about the Black Vault?

858
01:04:16,896 --> 01:04:18,550
That’s highly classified.

859
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,248
Tick-tock,
tick-tock, tick-tock.

860
01:04:21,422 --> 01:04:23,511
Sorry. Who did
you say you were?

861
01:04:23,685 --> 01:04:25,470
Just tell the man
why we’re here.

862
01:04:25,644 --> 01:04:26,775
Mr. Donloe. Bill.

863
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:28,342
Even if we could
tell you the truth,

864
01:04:28,516 --> 01:04:30,040
you wouldn’t believe it.
I wouldn’t.

865
01:04:30,214 --> 01:04:31,780
The heart of the matter
is that we need access

866
01:04:31,955 --> 01:04:34,566
to all your SOSUS data
from late winter 2012.

867
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:37,830
Otherwise the world will
cease to exist in a few days.

868
01:04:39,353 --> 01:04:41,268
It’s happening, isn’t it?

869
01:04:42,487 --> 01:04:43,749
The Entity.

870
01:04:45,403 --> 01:04:47,840
I’ve tried to warn people
about it for years, but...

871
01:04:49,233 --> 01:04:50,843
no one would listen.

872
01:04:51,757 --> 01:04:53,324
Can you help us?

873
01:04:53,933 --> 01:04:55,587
I wish I could.

874
01:05:13,779 --> 01:05:16,216
Please come in.

875
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:19,089
Make yourself comfortable.

876
01:05:23,093 --> 01:05:24,964
Sir! Wake up!

877
01:05:25,138 --> 01:05:26,748
Wake up, sir!

878
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:29,577
We got problems. Real problems.

879
01:05:29,751 --> 01:05:32,841
What’s happening?
It’s the Admiral Kuznetsov.

880
01:05:34,408 --> 01:05:36,149
We got to get out of here!

881
01:05:36,323 --> 01:05:38,543
We’re in Ivan’s
threat zone, man.

882
01:05:38,717 --> 01:05:41,372
Any sign of the Ohio?
No, sir. And we’re at bingo.

883
01:05:41,546 --> 01:05:44,201
If I don’t turn around soon,
we won’t have enough fuel
to get us back to the boat.

884
01:05:44,375 --> 01:05:46,681
Anything on the radio?
Nothing but static on VHF.

885
01:05:46,855 --> 01:05:49,119
If your friends are
broadcasting a signal,
we can’t hear it.

886
01:05:49,293 --> 01:05:50,381
Just take us into a hover.

887
01:05:50,555 --> 01:05:52,339
Sir, we are at bingo.
Five minutes!

888
01:05:52,513 --> 01:05:54,689
Just give me five
minutes. Please!

889
01:05:58,041 --> 01:05:59,520
We can give you one.

890
01:05:59,694 --> 01:06:01,174
Decel.

891
01:06:07,224 --> 01:06:09,443
What are we doing in a hover?
We got to bug out!

892
01:06:09,617 --> 01:06:10,923
Bogies at two.

893
01:06:13,230 --> 01:06:14,448
They’re showing us
their missiles, man.

894
01:06:17,364 --> 01:06:19,236
That’s the only warning
we’re gonna get.

895
01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:22,543
Russian Aircraft...
This is some World War III
shit here. We got to go!

896
01:06:22,717 --> 01:06:24,284
International
airspace. No challenge.

897
01:06:24,458 --> 01:06:26,678
I repeat:
No challenge is intended.

898
01:06:29,811 --> 01:06:31,726
Where the hell are you going?

899
01:07:33,353 --> 01:07:36,182
Where are you, Ethan?

900
01:08:16,396 --> 01:08:18,398
You must be Captain Bledsoe.

901
01:08:18,572 --> 01:08:22,010
And you must be
out of your mind.

902
01:08:23,229 --> 01:08:26,058
What exactly was the plan
if we hadn’t shown up?

903
01:08:26,232 --> 01:08:29,061
You know, I really hadn’t
thought that far ahead.

904
01:08:29,235 --> 01:08:30,715
Okay.

905
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:33,239
Nope.

906
01:08:37,983 --> 01:08:40,246
Rear Admiral Neely
sends her regards.

907
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:43,597
She told me to
expect a green flare.

908
01:08:45,338 --> 01:08:46,774
She never mentioned a Taser.

909
01:08:46,948 --> 01:08:48,994
Mind telling me
what this is all about?

910
01:08:49,168 --> 01:08:51,257
My mission is classified.
Uh-huh.

911
01:08:51,431 --> 01:08:52,998
I need you to take me north.

912
01:08:53,172 --> 01:08:54,608
Continue.

913
01:08:54,782 --> 01:08:56,175
I’m expecting a set
of exact coordinates

914
01:08:56,349 --> 01:08:58,046
via Morse code transmission.

915
01:08:58,221 --> 01:09:01,354
And just how exactly
do you expect
to receive them down here?

916
01:09:01,528 --> 01:09:03,748
You’d have to come
to periscope depth.

917
01:09:04,401 --> 01:09:05,967
Raise the antenna.

918
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:08,187
Signal-scan the low
end of the VHF band.

919
01:09:08,361 --> 01:09:11,059
For how long?
Fifteen minutes.

920
01:09:11,234 --> 01:09:15,151
That would give the Russians
fifteen minutes
to pinpoint our location.

921
01:09:15,325 --> 01:09:19,155
Starting at noon,
and every two hours after that,

922
01:09:19,329 --> 01:09:23,159
until my team sends
me those coordinates.

923
01:09:26,727 --> 01:09:28,555
North is
the Bering Sea, mister.

924
01:09:28,729 --> 01:09:32,124
Right now every submarine
in the Russian Pacific Fleet
is up there.

925
01:09:32,298 --> 01:09:34,561
My primary mission is to
lock down their positions

926
01:09:34,735 --> 01:09:36,476
and ascertain
what they’re up to.

927
01:09:36,650 --> 01:09:38,391
I’m thinking you
know the answer.

928
01:09:41,002 --> 01:09:43,179
What is that?
That’s St. Matthew Island.

929
01:09:43,353 --> 01:09:45,659
There’s nothing there but an
old SOSUS listening station.

930
01:09:45,833 --> 01:09:48,271
No, no, that right next to it.
What is that?

931
01:09:52,405 --> 01:09:53,841
That’s the Losharik.

932
01:09:54,015 --> 01:09:56,017
You know what that is?

933
01:09:57,062 --> 01:09:59,369
It’s a mini-sub,
Russian Special Forces.

934
01:09:59,543 --> 01:10:01,414
Get yourself
a gold star, mister.

935
01:10:01,588 --> 01:10:05,418
Aerial recon spotted it
off St. Matthew Island
just over an hour ago.

936
01:10:05,592 --> 01:10:07,768
It’s deployed from this:

937
01:10:07,942 --> 01:10:11,381
- The Belgorod.
- The deadliest
submarine in the Russian Navy.

938
01:10:11,555 --> 01:10:15,515
My secondary mission is
to locate that bastard
and hold it at risk.

939
01:10:15,689 --> 01:10:18,431
The Losharikmeans
it’s somewhere close by.

940
01:10:20,738 --> 01:10:22,261
You have people on that island.

941
01:10:22,435 --> 01:10:25,786
That’s where your coordinates
are coming from.

942
01:10:27,919 --> 01:10:29,050
Will you help me?

943
01:10:29,834 --> 01:10:31,183
Mister...

944
01:10:33,403 --> 01:10:35,448
if you want to poke the bear,

945
01:10:36,710 --> 01:10:39,322
oh, you’ve come
to the right man.

946
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:42,542
Like to speak with
your divemaster, sir.

947
01:10:42,716 --> 01:10:44,196
Chief!

948
01:10:44,936 --> 01:10:46,372
Yes, sir.

949
01:10:46,546 --> 01:10:48,853
Have Pills meet our guest
in the FORECON quarters.

950
01:10:49,027 --> 01:10:50,898
Aye, sir.
This way, sir.

951
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:54,902
As I’ve explained
to our friends here,

952
01:10:55,076 --> 01:10:57,035
I don’t have
the data they want.

953
01:10:57,209 --> 01:11:01,126
The agency ignored my request
to upgrade our system
for a decade.

954
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:03,781
One day a team shows up,
unannounced,

955
01:11:03,955 --> 01:11:06,566
and refits the entire system
in a matter of days.

956
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:08,438
I’m guessing this is
the winter of 2012.

957
01:11:08,612 --> 01:11:11,049
Right. The old system
ran on magnetic tapes,

958
01:11:11,223 --> 01:11:12,920
backed up to 8-inch floppies.

959
01:11:13,094 --> 01:11:14,444
These were in the
dog shed out back.

960
01:11:14,618 --> 01:11:17,229
These boxes might
contain the coordinates

961
01:11:17,403 --> 01:11:18,970
you’re all looking for,

962
01:11:19,144 --> 01:11:21,407
but I don’t have a reader.

963
01:11:21,581 --> 01:11:24,105
That was also
taken away in 2012.

964
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,282
You expect him to build one.

965
01:11:26,456 --> 01:11:29,459
I came for coordinates,
not boxes.

966
01:11:29,633 --> 01:11:31,896
Supposing you find
the coordinates.
What happens to my team?

967
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:35,465
I will take the coordinates to
my superiors. My men wait here.

968
01:11:35,639 --> 01:11:37,336
When we have located
what we’re looking for,

969
01:11:37,510 --> 01:11:40,383
my men will leave
and you will not be harmed.

970
01:11:40,557 --> 01:11:42,559
Would you believe
that if you were me?

971
01:11:42,733 --> 01:11:44,822
No, I would not.

972
01:11:44,996 --> 01:11:47,215
You have one hour
to build the drive.

973
01:11:49,479 --> 01:11:50,567
What’s your name?

974
01:11:50,741 --> 01:11:51,655
Koltsov.

975
01:11:51,829 --> 01:11:54,484
Your first name?
Captain.

976
01:11:54,658 --> 01:11:57,400
Koltsov, I’m Grace.
That’s Benji.

977
01:11:57,574 --> 01:11:59,880
Could we just, for five
minutes, be human beings?

978
01:12:00,054 --> 01:12:03,536
Not Russians, not Americans,
just people that want to see
our loved ones again.

979
01:12:03,710 --> 01:12:06,887
I have no one. Not even a dog.

980
01:12:07,061 --> 01:12:10,151
Well, you certainly
don’t have this key.

981
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:13,807
The cruciform key
that grants the holder access
to the Podkova.

982
01:12:13,981 --> 01:12:15,722
Even if you have
the coordinates,

983
01:12:15,896 --> 01:12:17,898
you still can’t safely retrieve
the Entity’s source code

984
01:12:18,072 --> 01:12:19,813
without our help.

985
01:12:20,901 --> 01:12:22,555
You have another key,

986
01:12:23,687 --> 01:12:25,079
don’t you?

987
01:12:26,472 --> 01:12:27,908
You’ve had one all along.

988
01:12:28,082 --> 01:12:30,476
What you don’t have
are the coordinates.

989
01:12:31,738 --> 01:12:34,175
And when you build the drive,

990
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,308
we will have that.

991
01:12:36,482 --> 01:12:39,180
Okay, let’s try something else.

992
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:41,618
What if I told you
that we have a friend

993
01:12:41,792 --> 01:12:46,100
who’s been disavowed by
his own government because he
refused to hand over this key?

994
01:12:46,274 --> 01:12:49,452
Our friend is out there
right now, independent
from any chain of command,

995
01:12:49,626 --> 01:12:51,192
waiting for us
to transmit those coordinates.

996
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:53,194
And he will stop at nothing

997
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:56,763
to safely retrieve the Podkova
and use the source code
stored on it

998
01:12:56,937 --> 01:12:58,374
to destroy the Entity.

999
01:12:58,548 --> 01:13:00,419
And not for the sake of
any one nation, but for all.

1000
01:13:00,593 --> 01:13:04,292
Don’t you see?
The Entity is counting on us
to distrust each other.

1001
01:13:04,467 --> 01:13:05,685
Please...

1002
01:13:05,859 --> 01:13:07,948
let us complete our mission.

1003
01:13:08,122 --> 01:13:09,776
We are not enemies.

1004
01:13:10,777 --> 01:13:14,215
Would you believe
that if you were me?

1005
01:13:17,436 --> 01:13:18,437
No.

1006
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:21,701
I suppose I wouldn’t.

1007
01:13:21,875 --> 01:13:23,616
You have one hour.

1008
01:13:28,447 --> 01:13:31,015
This is the Mark
VII pressure suit,

1009
01:13:31,189 --> 01:13:33,452
specifically designed
to reduce decompression time

1010
01:13:33,626 --> 01:13:35,498
after diving profound depths.

1011
01:13:35,672 --> 01:13:39,632
It does this by means
of an exotic mixture
of oxygen and inert gases.

1012
01:13:39,806 --> 01:13:42,374
You’ll need to do
an extended breathe-up
for your body to handle it.

1013
01:13:42,548 --> 01:13:44,637
Exactly what kind of gases
are we talking about?

1014
01:13:44,811 --> 01:13:46,509
That’s classified.

1015
01:13:46,683 --> 01:13:49,033
Assuming you’re on task
for twenty minutes or less,

1016
01:13:49,207 --> 01:13:53,820
your time in decompression will
be cut down from days to hours.

1017
01:13:54,952 --> 01:13:56,910
Theoretically.
Theoretically?

1018
01:13:57,084 --> 01:14:00,697
We haven’t tested the Mark VII
below 300 feet.

1019
01:14:00,871 --> 01:14:03,613
To conserve air,
you’ll need to make
a fast descent.

1020
01:14:03,787 --> 01:14:06,572
Which means guaranteed HPNS.

1021
01:14:06,746 --> 01:14:09,401
High Pressure Nervous Syndrome.

1022
01:14:09,575 --> 01:14:11,229
You should expect tremors,

1023
01:14:11,403 --> 01:14:14,014
shakes, dizziness,

1024
01:14:14,188 --> 01:14:16,582
disorientation,
and mental confusion.

1025
01:14:16,756 --> 01:14:20,543
And all of it
under extreme pressure.

1026
01:14:20,717 --> 01:14:23,807
Even if the Mark
VII works as designed,

1027
01:14:23,981 --> 01:14:26,984
you still won’t have enough
mixture for a slow ascent.

1028
01:14:27,158 --> 01:14:29,682
That means you’re guaranteed
to get the bends.

1029
01:14:31,292 --> 01:14:34,078
Nitrogen
in your muscle tissue expands
into your bloodstream.

1030
01:14:35,427 --> 01:14:37,168
Excruciating pain.

1031
01:14:37,777 --> 01:14:39,605
Convulsions.

1032
01:14:40,563 --> 01:14:43,087
Complete loss of
muscle control.

1033
01:14:43,261 --> 01:14:47,047
You’ll have maybe
twenty minutes to get
to the decompression chamber.

1034
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:53,619
And without the
decompression chamber...

1035
01:14:53,793 --> 01:14:55,752
You’re a dead man.

1036
01:14:58,450 --> 01:15:01,235
Another VHF scan
came and went.

1037
01:15:01,409 --> 01:15:03,455
If your friends
are broadcasting,

1038
01:15:03,629 --> 01:15:05,326
we still haven’t picked it up.

1039
01:15:21,255 --> 01:15:23,519
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

1040
01:15:30,395 --> 01:15:33,790
That’s the sled dogs
out in the barn.
It’s coming up to dinnertime.

1041
01:15:46,454 --> 01:15:48,239
I’m gonna let you in
on a little secret, friend.

1042
01:15:48,413 --> 01:15:51,764
There are no coordinates
on any of these disks.

1043
01:15:51,938 --> 01:15:55,594
That "refit"
fourteen years ago?

1044
01:15:55,768 --> 01:15:58,031
It had all the stench
of a cover-up.

1045
01:16:00,468 --> 01:16:03,384
And the top man
talked down to Tapeesa.

1046
01:16:04,385 --> 01:16:06,605
I did not like that.

1047
01:16:06,779 --> 01:16:09,303
I never told them
about these backups.

1048
01:16:09,477 --> 01:16:12,350
And when they left,
I went through every one
of them myself.

1049
01:16:12,524 --> 01:16:14,744
A lone event stood out.

1050
01:16:16,267 --> 01:16:18,443
A massive undersea implosion

1051
01:16:18,617 --> 01:16:20,967
about a month
before they arrived
to take everything away.

1052
01:16:21,141 --> 01:16:24,405
Naturally, I didn’t
understand the significance.

1053
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:27,539
But I noted the coordinates
and then

1054
01:16:27,713 --> 01:16:29,585
I destroyed the only disk.

1055
01:16:32,022 --> 01:16:35,329
Are you saying you
know where the Sevastopolis?

1056
01:16:36,896 --> 01:16:38,463
Down to the square meter.

1057
01:16:51,171 --> 01:16:52,172
Dinnertime.

1058
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:57,787
Can my wife please
tend to the dogs?

1059
01:16:57,961 --> 01:17:00,572
I can’t concentrate
with this racket.

1060
01:17:15,065 --> 01:17:17,633
The coordinates.

1061
01:17:17,807 --> 01:17:19,504
Be careful.

1062
01:17:24,378 --> 01:17:26,685
I love you.

1063
01:17:26,859 --> 01:17:29,470
I will see you again.

1064
01:17:30,471 --> 01:17:32,386
- She’s gonna need some help.
- I’ll go!

1065
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:35,738
I could use the air.

1066
01:17:38,392 --> 01:17:40,133
Go with them.

1067
01:18:05,637 --> 01:18:08,031
Five minutes
to the next broadcast window.

1068
01:18:08,205 --> 01:18:11,295
We’ll be under the ice cap
soon and lose all comms.

1069
01:18:12,557 --> 01:18:15,473
This will be our last chance.

1070
01:19:13,270 --> 01:19:16,316
Chief of the Watch,
raise number one comms antenna.

1071
01:19:31,723 --> 01:19:33,638
What? Wait! Wait, Hagar.

1072
01:19:33,812 --> 01:19:34,813
Wait!

1073
01:19:36,467 --> 01:19:39,078
Wait. What is this?
What is this?

1074
01:19:39,252 --> 01:19:41,515
You won’t stop
the Entity, Ethan.

1075
01:19:42,952 --> 01:19:44,649
I can’t let you.

1076
01:20:28,388 --> 01:20:30,129
Donloe, get to the radio!

1077
01:20:30,303 --> 01:20:31,565
Send the coordinates!

1078
01:21:03,684 --> 01:21:05,817
Conn radio!
VHF Morse code incoming.

1079
01:21:05,991 --> 01:21:07,732
Radio, on speaker.

1080
01:21:34,498 --> 01:21:35,542
Hagar,

1081
01:21:35,716 --> 01:21:37,544
you’ve spent too much...

1082
01:21:38,676 --> 01:21:39,851
time

1083
01:21:40,025 --> 01:21:41,548
on the Internet!

1084
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:32,599
He’s
sending the coordinates.

1085
01:22:32,773 --> 01:22:34,819
Our people are listening.

1086
01:22:34,993 --> 01:22:37,517
The roof is collapsing.
Get out.

1087
01:23:23,476 --> 01:23:24,956
No, wait!

1088
01:23:25,130 --> 01:23:26,218
Where’s Donloe?

1089
01:23:27,219 --> 01:23:28,133
Donloe!

1090
01:23:28,307 --> 01:23:29,787
We got to go!

1091
01:24:11,133 --> 01:24:13,570
The coordinates you wanted.

1092
01:24:13,744 --> 01:24:16,225
I’m afraid you’re
on the wrong boat.

1093
01:24:16,399 --> 01:24:19,445
That’s 2,000 miles
off the Cape of Good Hope.

1094
01:24:19,619 --> 01:24:21,534
On the other side of the world.

1095
01:24:21,708 --> 01:24:23,580
Damn near exactly.

1096
01:24:26,974 --> 01:24:28,585
"Exactly."

1097
01:24:40,466 --> 01:24:42,338
Exactly the opposite.

1098
01:24:42,512 --> 01:24:44,514
In case the Russians
were listening.

1099
01:24:45,123 --> 01:24:46,298
Very clever.

1100
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:48,561
Officer of the Deck,

1101
01:24:48,735 --> 01:24:50,650
set a new course: 3-4-0.

1102
01:24:50,824 --> 01:24:52,565
Right 15 degrees rudder,
steady on course 3-4-0.

1103
01:24:52,739 --> 01:24:54,306
Aye, sir.
My rudder is right 15.

1104
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:57,962
Officer of the Deck,
submerged contact,
bearing 1-0-0.

1105
01:24:58,136 --> 01:24:59,964
On the edge of
our starboard baffles.

1106
01:25:00,138 --> 01:25:02,619
On speaker.
Exhibiting tonals of a Russian
Oscar II-class submarine.

1107
01:25:02,793 --> 01:25:05,535
Chief of the Watch,
station the fire control
tracking party silently.

1108
01:25:05,709 --> 01:25:08,233
Silently. Aye, sir.
Well, that’s one
mission accomplished.

1109
01:25:08,407 --> 01:25:09,887
We found the Belgorod.

1110
01:25:10,061 --> 01:25:11,149
It’s right on our ass.

1111
01:25:11,323 --> 01:25:13,978
Wherever your mission
is taking you,

1112
01:25:14,152 --> 01:25:16,415
now you’re taking
the Russians there.

1113
01:25:18,461 --> 01:25:20,593
No, they’re never gonna
know my destination.

1114
01:25:20,767 --> 01:25:22,987
When we reach those
coordinates, I’d like you
to slow to ten knots,

1115
01:25:23,161 --> 01:25:24,684
turn this boat around

1116
01:25:24,858 --> 01:25:27,774
and take the Russians
back the way we came.

1117
01:25:27,948 --> 01:25:29,559
What happens to
your mission then?

1118
01:25:30,473 --> 01:25:32,779
I’ll be getting
off at the turn.

1119
01:25:34,216 --> 01:25:35,826
Mister,

1120
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,351
without our decompression
chamber, you’ll die for sure.

1121
01:25:39,525 --> 01:25:44,574
Sir, your decompression chamber
was never part of our plan.

1122
01:25:47,620 --> 01:25:49,231
Oh.

1123
01:25:49,405 --> 01:25:50,536
Okay.

1124
01:25:52,582 --> 01:25:55,889
What exactly is your plan?

1125
01:26:16,562 --> 01:26:17,563
Okay.

1126
01:26:33,231 --> 01:26:34,493
Huh?

1127
01:26:38,149 --> 01:26:41,021
Me? No! No, no, I can’t.
I don’t know how.
I don’t know how.

1128
01:26:48,855 --> 01:26:50,117
Of course.

1129
01:26:51,118 --> 01:26:52,337
Of course.

1130
01:26:53,338 --> 01:26:54,992
Yeah. Show me.

1131
01:26:57,429 --> 01:26:58,822
That’s "left."

1132
01:27:08,919 --> 01:27:10,007
"Forward."

1133
01:27:11,922 --> 01:27:14,446
Wooh.

1134
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:16,753
On this?
"Wooh" is stop?

1135
01:27:17,536 --> 01:27:19,234
Wooh.

1136
01:27:21,279 --> 01:27:22,280
Okay.

1137
01:27:23,586 --> 01:27:25,762
What’s this for?

1138
01:27:36,555 --> 01:27:37,687
Polar bear?

1139
01:28:15,942 --> 01:28:19,294
There’s your key, okay?
Power on.

1140
01:28:19,468 --> 01:28:20,425
Take a deep breath.

1141
01:28:22,645 --> 01:28:25,212
The Mark VII’s guidance
system will take you
to your coordinates.

1142
01:28:25,387 --> 01:28:28,694
The depth at your
location is 500 feet.

1143
01:28:28,868 --> 01:28:32,089
Figure 19 minutes to your
target, 10 minutes on task.

1144
01:28:33,525 --> 01:28:34,961
Any longer than that

1145
01:28:35,135 --> 01:28:38,008
and your chances of survival
decrease by the second.

1146
01:28:38,182 --> 01:28:39,749
And don’t forget:

1147
01:28:39,923 --> 01:28:42,621
You must exhale continuously
as you rise to the surface.

1148
01:28:42,795 --> 01:28:45,668
Hold your breath
and your lungs will explode.

1149
01:28:45,842 --> 01:28:48,105
The VHF transmitter
you asked for.

1150
01:28:48,279 --> 01:28:51,630
Your team should be
able to locate you
within a two-mile radius.

1151
01:28:51,804 --> 01:28:53,153
Look after that.

1152
01:28:55,112 --> 01:28:56,331
Good luck.

1153
01:29:05,601 --> 01:29:06,993
Take care of my suit.

1154
01:29:26,012 --> 01:29:28,275
Sonar, range to Belgorod.

1155
01:29:28,450 --> 01:29:30,887
Sir, I have near-field effect.
Too close to tell.

1156
01:29:31,061 --> 01:29:33,455
Maneuvering, slow
to ten knots by log.

1157
01:29:33,629 --> 01:29:35,370
Helm, on my mark,
right full rudder.

1158
01:29:35,544 --> 01:29:36,762
Standing by
for your mark, Captain.

1159
01:30:36,082 --> 01:30:37,170
Mark the turn.

1160
01:30:37,344 --> 01:30:39,477
Aye, sir.
My rudder is right full.

1161
01:30:49,748 --> 01:30:51,489
Godspeed, mister.

1162
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:56,240
Torpedo tube.

1163
01:48:47,346 --> 01:48:49,914
It’s okay. It’s okay.

1164
01:49:00,142 --> 01:49:01,447
Where is it?

1165
01:49:01,622 --> 01:49:05,060
The Podkova, where is it?
Here.

1166
01:49:06,714 --> 01:49:08,280
You did it, Ethan.

1167
01:49:09,455 --> 01:49:10,979
You did it.

1168
01:49:14,896 --> 01:49:16,550
So what happens now?

1169
01:49:20,466 --> 01:49:21,511
Now...

1170
01:49:22,381 --> 01:49:24,166
we find Gabriel.

1171
01:49:26,081 --> 01:49:28,431
We get Luther’s poison pill.

1172
01:49:29,780 --> 01:49:31,782
And we kill the Entity.

1173
01:49:33,349 --> 01:49:35,090
Ethan, I’ve been thinking.

1174
01:49:36,352 --> 01:49:39,877
How can we undo everything
the Entity has done?

1175
01:49:40,051 --> 01:49:42,750
If we could control it,

1176
01:49:42,924 --> 01:49:47,929
maybe we could bring
the world back from the brink.

1177
01:49:48,103 --> 01:49:49,234
Grace...

1178
01:49:50,671 --> 01:49:55,197
who on earth would you ever
trust with that much power?

1179
01:49:55,371 --> 01:49:57,765
Well, you, of course.

1180
01:49:57,939 --> 01:50:00,463
Only you.

1181
01:50:00,637 --> 01:50:03,814
I believe you were
meant to do this.

1182
01:50:04,423 --> 01:50:05,599
Not me.

1183
01:50:06,469 --> 01:50:07,557
Not anyone.

1184
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:15,870
Thank you...

1185
01:50:18,307 --> 01:50:20,396
for bringing me back.

1186
01:50:21,876 --> 01:50:23,573
Nothing to it.

1187
01:50:35,803 --> 01:50:37,631
It’s a long story.

1188
01:51:08,313 --> 01:51:10,838
We haven’t been
formally introduced. I’m--

1189
01:51:11,012 --> 01:51:13,275
William Donloe. Langley.

1190
01:51:13,971 --> 01:51:16,104
We met thirty years ago.

1191
01:51:16,278 --> 01:51:17,758
Almost.

1192
01:51:23,067 --> 01:51:24,503
So you’re him.

1193
01:51:24,678 --> 01:51:27,332
I understand I owe you my life.

1194
01:51:29,552 --> 01:51:32,207
I don’t know how to make amends
for what I’ve done to yours.

1195
01:51:32,381 --> 01:51:35,601
That’s a matter of
perspective, friend.

1196
01:51:35,776 --> 01:51:40,345
If you hadn’t broken
in the vault 30 years ago,
I’d probably still be there.

1197
01:51:40,519 --> 01:51:43,087
I’d probably even
think I was happy.

1198
01:51:43,261 --> 01:51:47,701
I never would have found
the only home that’s
ever brought me peace.

1199
01:51:47,875 --> 01:51:51,008
And I certainly never would
have met the woman I love.

1200
01:51:57,449 --> 01:51:59,625
There’s nothing
to be sorry about.

1201
01:52:02,933 --> 01:52:04,326
I owe you my life.

1202
01:52:15,032 --> 01:52:16,991
We’ll be landing
just as the clock runs out.

1203
01:52:17,165 --> 01:52:18,993
By the time we arrive,
the Entity will have control

1204
01:52:19,167 --> 01:52:21,604
of the world’s nine
automated doomsday arsenals.

1205
01:52:21,778 --> 01:52:23,911
And it will be fueling
the missiles it controls.

1206
01:52:24,085 --> 01:52:28,480
But it can’t launch until
it has a safe place to hide
if it wants to survive.

1207
01:52:28,654 --> 01:52:30,395
The safest place is here.

1208
01:52:30,569 --> 01:52:33,572
What is that?
The Doomsday Vault.
Kongo Yowa.

1209
01:52:33,747 --> 01:52:37,098
It’s a top secret
standalone, solar-powered,

1210
01:52:37,272 --> 01:52:39,056
TEMPEST-hardened, Level A

1211
01:52:39,230 --> 01:52:40,884
exabyte data server.

1212
01:52:41,058 --> 01:52:43,017
One billion
gigabytes of storage.

1213
01:52:43,191 --> 01:52:45,584
That’s a lot of home movies.
Well,
you’re not far off.

1214
01:52:45,759 --> 01:52:48,805
It contains all
the accumulated knowledge
deemed worthy of preservation.

1215
01:52:48,979 --> 01:52:50,851
And it’s fully shielded.

1216
01:52:51,025 --> 01:52:52,940
Totally impervious
to electromagnetic energy
of any kind.

1217
01:52:53,114 --> 01:52:54,463
No transmissions in or out.

1218
01:52:54,637 --> 01:52:56,639
An incorruptible
ark of human history

1219
01:52:56,813 --> 01:52:58,510
built to survive
the end of the world.

1220
01:52:58,684 --> 01:53:00,774
So, if the Entity got in there,

1221
01:53:00,948 --> 01:53:03,124
it could survive for
thousands of years,

1222
01:53:03,298 --> 01:53:04,865
no matter what happened
to the rest of the world.

1223
01:53:05,039 --> 01:53:06,692
And why would it
want to survive?

1224
01:53:06,867 --> 01:53:09,521
What does it stand
to gain from wiping out
all life on Earth?

1225
01:53:09,695 --> 01:53:13,612
A question Noah and his family
must have asked just
before the flood.

1226
01:53:13,787 --> 01:53:15,745
The Anti-God
thinks it’s God.

1227
01:53:15,919 --> 01:53:17,225
How do we kill it?

1228
01:53:17,399 --> 01:53:18,792
Always

1229
01:53:18,966 --> 01:53:20,489
right to the point,
aren’t you?

1230
01:53:20,663 --> 01:53:24,623
This is the poison pill
containing Luther’s algorithm.

1231
01:53:25,929 --> 01:53:27,539
And this is the Podkova,

1232
01:53:27,713 --> 01:53:29,759
containing the Entity’s
original source code.

1233
01:53:29,933 --> 01:53:33,502
When combined, they will
form a sort of digital toxin.

1234
01:53:33,676 --> 01:53:36,374
When uploaded to cyberspace,
this toxin will
attack the Entity

1235
01:53:36,548 --> 01:53:39,029
and alter its ability
to perceive reality.

1236
01:53:39,203 --> 01:53:41,945
So, combine that
with the Podkova...

1237
01:53:42,119 --> 01:53:44,643
We can deceive
the Lord of Lies.

1238
01:53:45,296 --> 01:53:47,168
But...

1239
01:53:47,342 --> 01:53:48,647
...there’s always a but.

1240
01:53:48,822 --> 01:53:50,084
Mais...

1241
01:53:50,258 --> 01:53:51,607
we don’t have
Luther’s poison pill.

1242
01:53:51,781 --> 01:53:53,870
Gabriel does.

1243
01:53:54,044 --> 01:53:56,699
Which is why we can be sure
he’ll be waiting for us
in the Doomsday Vault.

1244
01:53:56,873 --> 01:53:59,920
Once the Entity is infected
with Luther’s algorithm,

1245
01:54:00,094 --> 01:54:02,618
it will think it’s entering the
junction’s central data server

1246
01:54:02,792 --> 01:54:05,839
when it will actually
be going here.

1247
01:54:06,013 --> 01:54:07,536
What is it?

1248
01:54:07,710 --> 01:54:09,233
Careful,
it’s very delicate.

1249
01:54:09,799 --> 01:54:11,409
It can’t be.

1250
01:54:12,584 --> 01:54:15,196
It’s a 5D optical data drive.

1251
01:54:15,370 --> 01:54:17,676
360 terabytes in
the palm of your hand.

1252
01:54:17,851 --> 01:54:19,635
I thought these
were just theoretical.

1253
01:54:19,809 --> 01:54:20,810
They were.

1254
01:54:20,984 --> 01:54:22,768
Until Luther built one.

1255
01:54:27,861 --> 01:54:30,254
If the Entity is our genie,

1256
01:54:30,428 --> 01:54:34,258
then this optical drive is
the bottle we’ll capture it in.

1257
01:54:34,432 --> 01:54:36,173
Which brings us
to the tricky part.

1258
01:54:36,347 --> 01:54:38,175
Once inside,

1259
01:54:38,349 --> 01:54:40,047
once it believes
that it’s safe,

1260
01:54:40,221 --> 01:54:42,876
the Entity will
initiate a nuclear launch.

1261
01:54:43,050 --> 01:54:45,748
We have to disconnect this
drive before it can do that.

1262
01:54:45,922 --> 01:54:47,097
How long do we have?

1263
01:54:47,924 --> 01:54:48,838
Roughly...

1264
01:54:49,012 --> 01:54:50,448
100 milliseconds.

1265
01:54:50,622 --> 01:54:52,363
The blink of an eye.

1266
01:54:52,537 --> 01:54:54,365
If we do it too soon...

1267
01:54:54,539 --> 01:54:56,193
We won’t trap the
genie in the bottle.

1268
01:54:56,367 --> 01:54:58,152
Mmm. And if
we do it too late...

1269
01:54:58,326 --> 01:55:00,502
We won’t prevent the Entity
from launching.

1270
01:55:00,676 --> 01:55:02,199
Either way...

1271
01:55:02,373 --> 01:55:04,027
If we pull the
drive at the wrong time,

1272
01:55:04,201 --> 01:55:05,681
the Entity wins.

1273
01:55:05,855 --> 01:55:07,422
Good luck.

1274
01:55:07,596 --> 01:55:10,729
Hang on. If the Doomsday Vault
is electronically shielded,

1275
01:55:10,904 --> 01:55:12,340
how does the Entity
expect to get in?

1276
01:55:12,514 --> 01:55:15,169
It expects us to let it in.

1277
01:55:15,343 --> 01:55:18,389
Just like Gabriel expects me
to hand over the Podkova.

1278
01:55:18,563 --> 01:55:20,914
Neither of which
we’d ever do, obviously.

1279
01:55:22,002 --> 01:55:23,481
Right?

1280
01:55:23,655 --> 01:55:25,875
Think about it. The vault
is electronically shielded.

1281
01:55:26,049 --> 01:55:28,443
No signals get in or out.

1282
01:55:28,617 --> 01:55:31,185
Someone has to go
outside the vault

1283
01:55:31,359 --> 01:55:35,406
in order to upload Luther’s
poison pill to the Entity.

1284
01:55:35,580 --> 01:55:37,843
And if Gabriel wants
to control the Entity...

1285
01:55:39,410 --> 01:55:42,892
He has to upload
Luther’s poison pill.

1286
01:55:44,459 --> 01:55:47,505
You’re not seriously
gonna give him the Podkova

1287
01:55:47,679 --> 01:55:49,377
and let him get
away with the pill.

1288
01:55:49,551 --> 01:55:52,336
That’s exactly
what I’m going to do.

1289
01:55:52,510 --> 01:55:55,687
Gabriel will be part of
the team and never know it.

1290
01:55:55,861 --> 01:55:58,952
That’s insane! You’re letting
the Entity into the vault.

1291
01:55:59,126 --> 01:56:01,084
That’s precisely what
it wants you to do.

1292
01:56:01,258 --> 01:56:03,521
"It is written."

1293
01:56:03,695 --> 01:56:04,827
Yes.

1294
01:56:05,001 --> 01:56:06,829
And it’s the only
chance we have

1295
01:56:07,003 --> 01:56:08,178
of beating Gabriel
and the Entity.

1296
01:56:08,352 --> 01:56:09,614
One chance in a trillion.

1297
01:56:09,788 --> 01:56:11,877
Ethan, think about
what you’re doing.

1298
01:56:12,052 --> 01:56:15,577
Think about how you got here.
Think about how
the world got here.

1299
01:56:15,751 --> 01:56:19,189
How do you know that
the Entity didn’t want you
to recover the Podkova?

1300
01:56:19,363 --> 01:56:20,930
Maybe it told you
it was impossible

1301
01:56:21,104 --> 01:56:23,715
because it knew that was the
thing that you needed to hear!

1302
01:56:25,021 --> 01:56:26,675
Is that
what you think, Grace?

1303
01:56:26,849 --> 01:56:29,808
I think you’re risking
the fate of the world

1304
01:56:29,983 --> 01:56:32,246
and billions of lives

1305
01:56:32,420 --> 01:56:33,987
on the blink of an eye.

1306
01:56:34,161 --> 01:56:35,466
Yes, Grace.

1307
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:36,946
I am.

1308
01:56:38,469 --> 01:56:41,255
And if there was
another choice, I’d take it.

1309
01:56:42,647 --> 01:56:45,607
I know you all have your
doubts. I don’t blame you.

1310
01:56:45,781 --> 01:56:47,739
But we have to stick together.

1311
01:56:47,913 --> 01:56:50,307
And we have to
make sure that Grace

1312
01:56:50,481 --> 01:56:53,223
is the one to
disconnect that drive.

1313
01:56:53,397 --> 01:56:55,182
Me?

1314
01:56:55,356 --> 01:56:59,403
What separates a good
pickpocket from a great one?

1315
01:57:03,581 --> 01:57:04,756
Timing.

1316
01:57:05,714 --> 01:57:07,194
Blink of an eye.

1317
01:57:38,964 --> 01:57:40,749
Where is everybody?

1318
01:57:40,923 --> 01:57:42,664
They know what’s coming.

1319
01:57:43,882 --> 01:57:45,580
They’ve all gone home.

1320
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:56,433
We can’t
accurately predict how fast
the Entity is moving now.

1321
01:58:56,607 --> 01:58:59,088
Madam President, Hunt is gone.

1322
01:58:59,262 --> 01:59:01,525
If he isn’t dead,
the Russians have him.

1323
01:59:01,699 --> 01:59:03,658
If we lose
control of our arsenal,

1324
01:59:03,832 --> 01:59:06,269
we lose any hope of preventing
the Entity from launching.

1325
01:59:06,443 --> 01:59:08,184
We are out of time!

1326
01:59:12,232 --> 01:59:13,624
General Sidney...

1327
01:59:14,799 --> 01:59:17,324
what is our most
limited attack option?

1328
01:59:17,498 --> 01:59:19,195
Surgical
nuclear strikes

1329
01:59:19,369 --> 01:59:22,329
confined strictly to
the command centers
of the eight nations

1330
01:59:22,503 --> 01:59:24,026
under the Entity’s control.

1331
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:27,247
Beijing. Islamabad. London.

1332
01:59:27,986 --> 01:59:31,207
Moscow. New Delhi. Paris.

1333
01:59:31,381 --> 01:59:33,905
Pyongyang. And Tel Aviv.

1334
01:59:34,079 --> 01:59:35,820
Casualties.

1335
01:59:35,994 --> 01:59:39,128
Estimated death tolls
from initial strikes.

1336
01:59:40,651 --> 01:59:45,700
And more later, of course,
from the resulting
nuclear fallout.

1337
01:59:45,874 --> 01:59:49,007
Estimates, uh... vary.

1338
01:59:49,182 --> 01:59:53,186
Obviously the bombing
of major cities
in eight different countries

1339
01:59:53,360 --> 01:59:56,101
would create an unprecedented
political crisis.

1340
01:59:56,276 --> 02:00:00,541
One that would likely lead
to a protracted global war.

1341
02:00:00,715 --> 02:00:04,327
It may be diplomatically
prudent to make a...

1342
02:00:06,329 --> 02:00:07,330
gesture.

1343
02:00:09,376 --> 02:00:11,116
A gesture?

1344
02:00:11,291 --> 02:00:14,119
Sacrifice one of our
cities here at home.

1345
02:00:15,512 --> 02:00:17,601
We’ve prepared a list.

1346
02:00:19,734 --> 02:00:23,912
Cities have been
arranged by strategic
and economic importance.

1347
02:00:24,086 --> 02:00:26,306
And...

1348
02:00:26,480 --> 02:00:27,916
...population, of course.

1349
02:00:28,090 --> 02:00:31,572
You’d be sacrificing
a hundred million lives...

1350
02:00:32,486 --> 02:00:34,444
to save seven billion.

1351
02:00:36,229 --> 02:00:37,969
This can’t be happening.

1352
02:00:38,143 --> 02:00:39,362
Madam President,

1353
02:00:39,536 --> 02:00:42,235
we are in
the Entity’s reality now.

1354
02:00:42,409 --> 02:00:45,673
And this is checkmate.

1355
02:01:02,516 --> 02:01:05,345
Gunnery Sergeant,
I need your sidearm.

1356
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:07,825
Sir?

1357
02:01:07,999 --> 02:01:10,785
You heard me, son.
Hand it over.

1358
02:01:25,713 --> 02:01:27,802
The main server’s
through there.

1359
02:01:27,976 --> 02:01:31,153
Now, Benji, Grace,
you come with me.

1360
02:01:31,327 --> 02:01:32,981
The rest of you,
you just wait here.

1361
02:01:33,155 --> 02:01:34,243
Non.

1362
02:01:34,417 --> 02:01:35,679
Gabriel is down there.

1363
02:01:36,332 --> 02:01:37,768
Let me come with you.

1364
02:01:38,726 --> 02:01:40,510
His time will come.

1365
02:02:04,229 --> 02:02:06,275
That’s the door
to the server room.

1366
02:02:06,449 --> 02:02:08,277
It’s too exposed.

1367
02:02:08,451 --> 02:02:10,410
You should go back
to the others.

1368
02:02:10,584 --> 02:02:13,500
If Gabriel is in there,
he’ll kill you.

1369
02:02:13,674 --> 02:02:16,590
He has to leave here with
the pill and the Podkova.

1370
02:02:17,721 --> 02:02:20,681
I’m expendable.
Neither of you are.

1371
02:02:21,638 --> 02:02:22,683
He’s right.

1372
02:02:32,519 --> 02:02:34,434
Take care of your team.

1373
02:03:22,699 --> 02:03:24,527
Your final reckoning!

1374
02:03:44,068 --> 02:03:45,940
Thirty megaton yield.

1375
02:03:46,114 --> 02:03:50,205
My man lets go of that
button and the Entity
has no place to hide.

1376
02:03:50,379 --> 02:03:52,250
And what happens to you?

1377
02:03:52,425 --> 02:03:56,167
I have a plane that’ll take me
to minimum safe distance.

1378
02:03:56,341 --> 02:04:00,084
Reliable, analog,
under the radar.

1379
02:04:00,258 --> 02:04:03,348
I even brought a spare.
Just in case.

1380
02:04:03,523 --> 02:04:05,873
And you honestly believe
destroying this place

1381
02:04:06,047 --> 02:04:07,527
will stop the Entity
from launching.

1382
02:04:07,701 --> 02:04:09,180
I think it’s bluffing.

1383
02:04:09,354 --> 02:04:11,095
It won’t end the world
if it can’t survive,

1384
02:04:11,269 --> 02:04:13,271
and it can’t survive
if you don’t let it in.

1385
02:04:13,446 --> 02:04:15,404
Now hand over the Podkova

1386
02:04:15,578 --> 02:04:17,058
and I’ll let you walk away.

1387
02:04:17,232 --> 02:04:20,322
Why would I believe that?
Because I want you

1388
02:04:20,496 --> 02:04:22,846
and everyone you care about

1389
02:04:23,020 --> 02:04:26,154
to live long lives
in the world I create

1390
02:04:26,328 --> 02:04:28,635
when the Entity answers to me.

1391
02:04:28,809 --> 02:04:30,332
You’re beat, Ethan.

1392
02:04:30,506 --> 02:04:34,249
If not today, some other place,
some other time.

1393
02:04:35,337 --> 02:04:37,426
As long as I have this,

1394
02:04:37,600 --> 02:04:40,603
wherever I go, you will follow.

1395
02:04:40,777 --> 02:04:43,301
And the Podkova
will come to me.

1396
02:04:43,476 --> 02:04:45,260
That is written.

1397
02:04:45,434 --> 02:04:47,523
Nothing is written.

1398
02:04:47,697 --> 02:04:50,134
I’m not sure
Luther would agree.

1399
02:04:52,702 --> 02:04:53,964
Now,

1400
02:04:54,138 --> 02:04:56,532
tell me I win!

1401
02:05:06,760 --> 02:05:07,717
You win.

1402
02:05:07,891 --> 02:05:09,980
I like the sound of that.

1403
02:05:10,546 --> 02:05:12,026
Say it again.

1404
02:05:12,200 --> 02:05:13,114
Uh-uh.

1405
02:05:13,288 --> 02:05:14,637
Oh, no.

1406
02:05:14,811 --> 02:05:16,857
Hands where I can
see them, dickhead.

1407
02:05:49,672 --> 02:05:51,152
Let’s have it.

1408
02:05:51,326 --> 02:05:52,370
Time?

1409
02:05:52,545 --> 02:05:54,329
18 minutes.

1410
02:05:58,768 --> 02:05:59,769
I know you.

1411
02:05:59,943 --> 02:06:01,205
Donloe.

1412
02:06:01,379 --> 02:06:02,685
William Donloe.

1413
02:06:02,859 --> 02:06:05,035
My wife, Tapeesa.

1414
02:06:05,209 --> 02:06:08,909
I got to hand it to you, Hunt.
This is one crackerjack unit
you’ve put together.

1415
02:06:09,083 --> 02:06:13,261
I’m imagining the Entity is
shaking in its virtual shorts
right about now.

1416
02:06:13,435 --> 02:06:17,265
What do I need to know
about this, and what
exactly was the play?

1417
02:06:17,439 --> 02:06:20,573
The only play is
to give that to him,
and let him go right now.

1418
02:06:20,747 --> 02:06:23,227
You want me to give this
to him and let him go.

1419
02:06:23,401 --> 02:06:24,751
Right now.
Right now.

1420
02:06:24,925 --> 02:06:26,970
Right now.
Right now...

1421
02:06:27,144 --> 02:06:29,016
the President of
the United States

1422
02:06:29,190 --> 02:06:31,845
is preparing to
vaporize millions
upon millions of souls.

1423
02:06:32,019 --> 02:06:37,415
All because Ethan here
doesn’t believe that anyone
can safely control the Entity.

1424
02:06:37,590 --> 02:06:40,331
Does that sound sane?
To anyone?

1425
02:06:40,505 --> 02:06:43,421
Maybe you should ask
the crew of the Sevastopol.

1426
02:06:45,902 --> 02:06:47,774
Time?
17 minutes, sir.

1427
02:06:47,948 --> 02:06:50,907
Kittridge.
You wouldn’t be here if
Ethan didn’t have a plan.

1428
02:06:51,081 --> 02:06:53,518
Whomever tells me
what that plan is

1429
02:06:53,693 --> 02:06:57,392
will be sparing millions
of lives, and you’ll be
spared the fate of the others.

1430
02:06:57,566 --> 02:06:59,786
Sir, we’re running out of time.
We need to get to
a minimum safe distance.

1431
02:06:59,960 --> 02:07:01,178
Why are we still standing here?

1432
02:07:01,352 --> 02:07:04,094
Because he’s here
and he’s here.

1433
02:07:04,268 --> 02:07:06,619
And this means something.

1434
02:07:07,315 --> 02:07:08,795
Any second now

1435
02:07:08,969 --> 02:07:11,754
Ethan’s gonna
tell me what it is.

1436
02:07:11,928 --> 02:07:14,452
I’ve known this man
for a long time.

1437
02:07:14,627 --> 02:07:19,893
And he won’t want anything to
happen to his precious team.

1438
02:07:24,332 --> 02:07:26,290
And that’s the pattern,
isn’t it?

1439
02:07:26,987 --> 02:07:29,946
You refuse to sacrifice

1440
02:07:30,120 --> 02:07:32,601
the ones you hold close.

1441
02:07:34,864 --> 02:07:37,214
That is why we’re still here.

1442
02:07:38,215 --> 02:07:39,521
It’s over.

1443
02:07:39,695 --> 02:07:41,262
There’s no shame in it.

1444
02:07:41,871 --> 02:07:42,872
Now just...

1445
02:07:44,004 --> 02:07:45,353
tell me what I’m missing.

1446
02:07:45,962 --> 02:07:46,963
Time.

1447
02:08:02,326 --> 02:08:03,980
Okay.
Now!

1448
02:08:20,301 --> 02:08:21,519
Gabriel!

1449
02:08:24,697 --> 02:08:27,569
Paris, Gabriel now!
Kill him now!

1450
02:08:31,921 --> 02:08:35,011
Degas! Gabriel! Shoot him,
shoot him, kill him! Kill him!

1451
02:08:37,405 --> 02:08:39,276
Catch me if you can, Ethan!

1452
02:08:39,450 --> 02:08:41,191
You go after him
and get the pill.

1453
02:08:41,365 --> 02:08:43,106
We’ll get to the server room
and let the Entity in.

1454
02:08:47,197 --> 02:08:48,895
Ethan, we’ll figure it out.

1455
02:08:49,069 --> 02:08:51,593
You are forgetting the bomb.
The nuclear bomb.

1456
02:08:51,767 --> 02:08:53,421
We’ll figure it out.

1457
02:08:53,595 --> 02:08:54,639
- Ethan!
- Benji.

1458
02:08:54,814 --> 02:08:56,206
Go! I got this.

1459
02:08:56,380 --> 02:08:57,425
Go.

1460
02:09:01,211 --> 02:09:02,473
Blink of an eye.

1461
02:09:08,566 --> 02:09:10,481
Paris! Cover, cover!

1462
02:09:13,354 --> 02:09:14,398
Hunt!

1463
02:09:17,837 --> 02:09:20,753
I thought
he’d never leave.

1464
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:26,671
We’ll figure it out.

1465
02:09:33,722 --> 02:09:34,854
We got to go, Briggs.

1466
02:09:35,028 --> 02:09:36,507
It’s your funeral.
Let’s go.

1467
02:11:58,214 --> 02:11:59,912
There has to be
a way to disarm it.

1468
02:12:00,086 --> 02:12:01,565
Even if you can prevent it
from going nuclear,

1469
02:12:01,739 --> 02:12:03,828
you can’t stop those
detonators from exploding.

1470
02:12:04,003 --> 02:12:05,787
Could we survive the blast
from the server room?

1471
02:12:05,961 --> 02:12:08,921
Only if someone stays behind
and stops the bomb
from going critical.

1472
02:12:09,095 --> 02:12:12,881
But whoever that is,
they’re not going to make it.

1473
02:12:14,013 --> 02:12:16,798
Who will live
and who will die?

1474
02:12:19,932 --> 02:12:23,631
We’ll handle the bomb.
The rest of you get Benji
to the server room.

1475
02:12:23,805 --> 02:12:26,242
There’s no time
to discuss it. Go.

1476
02:12:26,416 --> 02:12:27,896
I will see you again.

1477
02:12:31,595 --> 02:12:32,857
Keep pressure on it.

1478
02:12:33,032 --> 02:12:35,251
I’ve got it.
I’ve got it.

1479
02:12:36,818 --> 02:12:38,298
I’ll stay with them.

1480
02:12:38,472 --> 02:12:41,431
There’s nothing for me
to do in the server room.

1481
02:12:41,997 --> 02:12:43,346
Good luck.

1482
02:12:44,652 --> 02:12:45,696
Good luck.

1483
02:14:15,090 --> 02:14:16,309
Where’d you learn to do this?

1484
02:14:16,483 --> 02:14:18,398
Never said I did.

1485
02:14:37,112 --> 02:14:39,332
This is not good.
What is it?

1486
02:14:39,506 --> 02:14:41,856
If I had to guess,
it’s a tension pneumothorax.

1487
02:14:42,030 --> 02:14:45,381
What does that mean?
Pressure building
in the pleural cavity.

1488
02:14:45,555 --> 02:14:47,253
My lung is collapsing.

1489
02:14:47,427 --> 02:14:51,039
If we don’t act fast, it means
suffocation or cardiac arrest.

1490
02:14:51,213 --> 02:14:53,737
Do either of you have
any medical experience?

1491
02:14:54,912 --> 02:14:56,044
I kill people.

1492
02:14:57,306 --> 02:14:58,612
I can work with that.

1493
02:14:58,786 --> 02:15:00,440
Grace, I need
you to hack the server

1494
02:15:00,614 --> 02:15:02,224
so we can let the Entity in.

1495
02:15:02,398 --> 02:15:04,661
Grab the tools, head
to the panel. Paris.

1496
02:15:04,835 --> 02:15:05,923
You have to operate on me.

1497
02:15:06,098 --> 02:15:08,274
Moi?

1498
02:15:08,448 --> 02:15:10,928
First I need you
to plug the bullet hole,
make it airtight.

1499
02:15:11,103 --> 02:15:12,147
Close it tight.

1500
02:15:12,321 --> 02:15:13,409
A bandage.

1501
02:15:13,583 --> 02:15:14,497
A bandage please.

1502
02:16:10,814 --> 02:16:12,729
I’m in. What do I do?

1503
02:16:12,903 --> 02:16:14,644
Grace, I need you to
find the power switch...

1504
02:16:14,818 --> 02:16:16,211
...to the server’s
internal network.

1505
02:16:16,385 --> 02:16:17,865
Got it.
Paris.

1506
02:16:18,039 --> 02:16:20,781
My clavicle...
count down to my second rib.

1507
02:16:22,783 --> 02:16:23,914
Now...

1508
02:16:24,524 --> 02:16:25,742
...make an incision.

1509
02:16:33,402 --> 02:16:34,447
Hold this.

1510
02:16:36,666 --> 02:16:38,015
Paris.

1511
02:16:38,190 --> 02:16:39,495
It’s going to be OK.

1512
02:16:41,193 --> 02:16:42,672
Bottoms up.

1513
02:16:48,417 --> 02:16:50,332
Now what?

1514
02:16:50,506 --> 02:16:51,420
Pen... in the bag.

1515
02:16:51,594 --> 02:16:52,508
Pressure.

1516
02:16:53,161 --> 02:16:54,510
Take it apart.

1517
02:16:54,684 --> 02:16:56,512
Grace,
did you find the switch?

1518
02:16:56,686 --> 02:16:58,558
Yeah.
Okay, shut it off.

1519
02:16:58,732 --> 02:17:01,561
What next?
Open the panel.

1520
02:17:01,735 --> 02:17:04,259
Now what?
Push that
into the incision.

1521
02:17:04,912 --> 02:17:06,261
Hurry.

1522
02:17:15,879 --> 02:17:16,750
Thank you.

1523
02:17:20,449 --> 02:17:21,972
Oh, thank God.

1524
02:17:22,146 --> 02:17:23,887
Degas, how’s it going in there?

1525
02:17:24,061 --> 02:17:26,194
Uh, everything’s
under control here.

1526
02:17:26,368 --> 02:17:29,241
Okay, hold this very steady.

1527
02:17:29,415 --> 02:17:32,244
But don’t pull it out.

1528
02:17:54,309 --> 02:17:55,919
It’s like
I said, Ethan.

1529
02:17:58,748 --> 02:18:00,315
As long as I have the pill...

1530
02:18:01,708 --> 02:18:04,537
the Podkova will come to me.

1531
02:18:54,326 --> 02:18:56,197
Hang on.
What? What is it?

1532
02:18:56,371 --> 02:18:58,547
We may have a way out of this.

1533
02:18:58,721 --> 02:19:01,376
These ground wires
are triple redundant.

1534
02:19:01,550 --> 02:19:03,726
If we cut any three
of them simultaneously,

1535
02:19:03,900 --> 02:19:06,425
we could delay these
detonators from exploding.

1536
02:19:06,599 --> 02:19:08,775
Maybe long enough for someone
to make it to the server room.

1537
02:19:08,949 --> 02:19:10,385
How long?

1538
02:19:11,386 --> 02:19:13,257
Ten seconds. Maybe.

1539
02:19:14,520 --> 02:19:16,913
You think you can make it
to that door in ten seconds?

1540
02:19:19,829 --> 02:19:22,223
Only one way to find out.
Hand me the ratchet.

1541
02:19:22,397 --> 02:19:25,574
Okay, I’m in. What now?
We’re not out
of the woods yet.

1542
02:19:25,748 --> 02:19:27,663
Any minute now,
my blood pressure’s
gonna drop drastically

1543
02:19:27,837 --> 02:19:30,884
and I’ll grow faint,
so we need to work fast.

1544
02:19:31,058 --> 02:19:34,322
There’s a receiver in
the tool bag. A silver box
with two lights on it.

1545
02:19:34,496 --> 02:19:36,063
Got it.

1546
02:19:36,237 --> 02:19:37,412
We need to splice that into
the server’s solar panels

1547
02:19:37,586 --> 02:19:38,500
and make an antenna.

1548
02:19:38,674 --> 02:19:39,936
That way we’ll know

1549
02:19:40,110 --> 02:19:41,547
when Ethan’s uploading
the poison pill.

1550
02:19:41,721 --> 02:19:43,679
Yep. Got it.
Now this is
the really tricky part.

1551
02:19:43,853 --> 02:19:46,203
There is a bundle of blue,
black, and red cables

1552
02:19:46,378 --> 02:19:48,162
in the lower right corner.

1553
02:19:48,336 --> 02:19:50,164
All right. Walk me through it.

1554
02:19:50,338 --> 02:19:52,949
I’m gonna need you to
cut two of the wires
in a specific order,

1555
02:19:53,123 --> 02:19:57,127
but whatever you do,
do not cut...

1556
02:19:59,608 --> 02:20:01,784
Benji!
...the red ones.

1557
02:20:03,569 --> 02:20:06,528
Madam President,
as your Secretary of Defense

1558
02:20:06,702 --> 02:20:10,402
I direct your attention
to CONPLAN 8044,

1559
02:20:10,576 --> 02:20:13,187
selected Attack Option 9.1.

1560
02:20:13,361 --> 02:20:15,929
A targeted nuclear strike
on the command centers

1561
02:20:16,103 --> 02:20:19,236
of all eight nations now
controlled by the Entity.

1562
02:20:19,411 --> 02:20:23,893
Amended to include
the American city
you’ve chosen to sacrifice.

1563
02:20:25,329 --> 02:20:26,461
The Biscuit.

1564
02:20:39,648 --> 02:20:41,824
Have you spoken to your son?

1565
02:20:43,478 --> 02:20:45,437
What would I tell him?

1566
02:20:45,611 --> 02:20:47,656
Authentication code verified.

1567
02:20:52,052 --> 02:20:53,488
Come on!

1568
02:21:04,891 --> 02:21:06,327
Come on, Ethan.

1569
02:21:06,501 --> 02:21:07,850
Know when you’re beat.

1570
02:21:08,024 --> 02:21:10,462
Any minute now
your team will be dead.

1571
02:21:10,636 --> 02:21:13,769
And the Entity will
have no place to hide.

1572
02:21:27,870 --> 02:21:29,829
I’m gonna run
you into the ground.

1573
02:21:30,003 --> 02:21:32,484
The Podkova will be mine

1574
02:21:32,658 --> 02:21:34,703
and the Entity
will answer to me.

1575
02:21:35,487 --> 02:21:37,401
It’s only a matter of time.

1576
02:21:39,403 --> 02:21:40,796
Ow.
Grace, we think

1577
02:21:40,970 --> 02:21:42,189
we can prevent this bomb
from going nuclear,

1578
02:21:42,363 --> 02:21:43,495
but all of these
detonators will explode.

1579
02:21:43,669 --> 02:21:44,713
How big a blast?

1580
02:21:45,671 --> 02:21:47,237
How big a blast are we talking?

1581
02:21:48,978 --> 02:21:50,458
Big.

1582
02:21:50,632 --> 02:21:52,329
Ethan needs all the
time we can give him.

1583
02:21:52,504 --> 02:21:54,810
Do not make the last cut
until we absolutely have to.

1584
02:22:01,034 --> 02:22:02,078
Madam President,

1585
02:22:02,731 --> 02:22:04,907
launch is now enabled.

1586
02:22:33,588 --> 02:22:35,068
What are you doing?

1587
02:22:35,242 --> 02:22:38,201
What we should have done
in the first place.

1588
02:22:38,375 --> 02:22:42,902
Order U.S. Strategic Command
Center to cut their power.

1589
02:22:43,076 --> 02:22:45,469
Take our missiles
offline entirely.

1590
02:22:46,383 --> 02:22:48,298
Shut everything down.

1591
02:22:48,472 --> 02:22:51,737
Madam President,
that would leave the country
completely defenseless.

1592
02:22:51,911 --> 02:22:56,306
But deny the Entity access
to the largest nuclear arsenal
on Earth.

1593
02:22:56,480 --> 02:22:57,786
Now, make the call.

1594
02:22:57,960 --> 02:22:59,222
Oh, thank God.

1595
02:22:59,396 --> 02:23:00,920
Ma’am, We are the only
nation on Earth

1596
02:23:01,094 --> 02:23:03,052
with the power
to attack the Entity!

1597
02:23:03,226 --> 02:23:05,707
And now we’re the only nation
in the world with the power
of choice.

1598
02:23:05,881 --> 02:23:07,970
Today I choose not to attack.

1599
02:23:08,144 --> 02:23:09,711
Madam President,
think this through.

1600
02:23:09,885 --> 02:23:11,757
You are making
a terrible mistake!

1601
02:23:11,931 --> 02:23:14,063
For the sake of the country,
please listen to reason.

1602
02:23:14,237 --> 02:23:15,499
That’s precisely
what I’m doing.

1603
02:23:15,674 --> 02:23:17,893
Connect me with
Strategic Command HQ.

1604
02:23:18,067 --> 02:23:20,330
Millions
of people will die, ma’am,
if you don’t push that button.

1605
02:23:20,504 --> 02:23:22,245
And millions of other
people will die if she does!

1606
02:23:22,419 --> 02:23:24,204
What give us the right to
decide who lives and who dies?

1607
02:23:24,378 --> 02:23:26,336
She took an oath as
President of the United States.

1608
02:23:26,510 --> 02:23:28,991
Twenty minutes after we launch,
none of that will matter!

1609
02:23:29,165 --> 02:23:31,167
I’m inclined to agree
with the President.

1610
02:23:31,341 --> 02:23:34,170
While we stand here arguing,
the Entity is preparing
to attack, ma’am!

1611
02:23:34,344 --> 02:23:38,218
You may choose to live
in the Entity’s reality,
gentlemen. I don’t.

1612
02:23:38,392 --> 02:23:39,785
Hold for the President.

1613
02:23:39,959 --> 02:23:41,917
General Overton’s office,
Strategic Command.

1614
02:23:42,091 --> 02:23:45,965
General Overton,
this is the President calling
with an unorthodox command.

1615
02:23:46,139 --> 02:23:48,663
I need you to listen to my
instructions very carefully

1616
02:23:48,837 --> 02:23:51,187
and follow them to the letter
without hesitation.

1617
02:23:58,630 --> 02:24:00,283
Madam President?
I’m fine. I’m fine.

1618
02:24:15,995 --> 02:24:17,213
General!

1619
02:24:19,651 --> 02:24:21,435
Madam President.

1620
02:25:07,437 --> 02:25:09,526
The Entity will be
fueling its missiles by now,

1621
02:25:09,701 --> 02:25:11,920
but it still needs a place
to hide before it launches.

1622
02:25:12,094 --> 02:25:14,488
Talk to me, Grace.
I’ve got it. It’s done.

1623
02:25:14,662 --> 02:25:15,837
Receiver’s connected.

1624
02:25:16,011 --> 02:25:17,230
Okay. Here we go.

1625
02:25:17,404 --> 02:25:18,492
We’re gonna switch
the power back on.

1626
02:25:22,061 --> 02:25:23,497
Receiver’s activated.
Red light is on.

1627
02:25:23,671 --> 02:25:25,020
Degas, how we doing?

1628
02:25:25,194 --> 02:25:26,587
Great. We’re extracting
the last detonator.

1629
02:25:26,761 --> 02:25:27,675
We’re ready to cut the fuses.

1630
02:25:27,849 --> 02:25:29,285
Four minutes on the clock.

1631
02:25:29,459 --> 02:25:30,939
Understood. Four minutes.

1632
02:25:31,113 --> 02:25:32,027
Insert the drive.

1633
02:25:32,898 --> 02:25:34,595
Ready.

1634
02:25:34,769 --> 02:25:36,902
Now, you’re gonna watch
the lights on the receiver.

1635
02:25:37,076 --> 02:25:38,860
When the red light turns--

1636
02:25:40,122 --> 02:25:41,950
What? Sorry.

1637
02:25:42,124 --> 02:25:43,996
When the red light turns green,

1638
02:25:44,170 --> 02:25:47,216
you’ll know Ethan has connected
the pill to the Podkova

1639
02:25:47,390 --> 02:25:49,697
and the Entity
has been infected
with Luther’s algorithm.

1640
02:25:49,871 --> 02:25:51,568
Okay. Then what?

1641
02:25:51,743 --> 02:25:54,833
Then you’re gonna cut that
red wire and let the Entity in.

1642
02:25:56,095 --> 02:25:59,141
All we need now is
for Ethan to get that pill.

1643
02:25:59,881 --> 02:26:01,535
He’ll figure it out.

1644
02:27:26,054 --> 02:27:27,839
Come on!

1645
02:30:30,238 --> 02:30:33,154
Only one of us has a parachute!

1646
02:30:33,328 --> 02:30:35,330
Good luck!

1647
02:31:20,549 --> 02:31:22,160
We’re almost out of time.

1648
02:31:22,334 --> 02:31:24,901
At 10 seconds I’m gonna
count backwards from three.

1649
02:31:25,076 --> 02:31:27,426
Three, two, one, cut.

1650
02:31:27,600 --> 02:31:29,341
Then we run like
hell for that door.

1651
02:31:29,515 --> 02:31:31,560
Remember,
when that drive lights up

1652
02:31:31,734 --> 02:31:33,388
you’ll know
the Entity’s inside.

1653
02:31:33,562 --> 02:31:35,651
You have 100 milliseconds.

1654
02:31:36,696 --> 02:31:37,827
The blink of an eye.

1655
02:32:40,281 --> 02:32:42,370
Where are you, Ethan?

1656
02:33:05,001 --> 02:33:06,220
Ethan!

1657
02:34:39,705 --> 02:34:41,272
This is the President.

1658
02:34:52,283 --> 02:34:53,501
He did it.

1659
02:34:56,896 --> 02:35:00,029
That son of a bitch
actually did it.

1660
02:35:25,881 --> 02:35:27,318
Hello, brother.

1661
02:35:30,146 --> 02:35:32,410
If you’re listening to this,

1662
02:35:32,584 --> 02:35:34,629
the world is still here.

1663
02:35:34,803 --> 02:35:36,239
And so are you.

1664
02:35:37,371 --> 02:35:41,114
For the record,
I never had a moment of doubt.

1665
02:35:43,029 --> 02:35:46,206
I knew you’d find a way.

1666
02:35:47,381 --> 02:35:49,078
You always do.

1667
02:35:51,820 --> 02:35:55,128
I hope in time
you can see this life

1668
02:35:55,302 --> 02:35:58,349
was not some quirk of fate.

1669
02:35:58,523 --> 02:36:01,526
This was your calling.

1670
02:36:01,700 --> 02:36:03,571
Your destiny.

1671
02:36:03,745 --> 02:36:07,880
A destiny that touches
every living thing.

1672
02:36:10,230 --> 02:36:14,756
Like it or not,
we are masters of our fate.

1673
02:36:15,714 --> 02:36:18,586
Nothing is written.

1674
02:36:21,197 --> 02:36:22,503
And our cause,

1675
02:36:23,635 --> 02:36:25,027
however righteous,

1676
02:36:25,201 --> 02:36:27,334
pales in comparison

1677
02:36:27,508 --> 02:36:29,249
to the impact

1678
02:36:29,423 --> 02:36:31,207
of our effect.

1679
02:36:34,559 --> 02:36:36,996
Any hope for a better future

1680
02:36:37,170 --> 02:36:40,434
comes from willing
that future into being.

1681
02:36:40,608 --> 02:36:46,222
A future reflecting the measure
of good within ourselves.

1682
02:36:46,397 --> 02:36:47,746
Fire control!

1683
02:36:47,920 --> 02:36:49,965
And all that
is good inside us...

1684
02:36:50,139 --> 02:36:51,227
Stand down.

1685
02:36:51,402 --> 02:36:53,099
...is measured by the good

1686
02:36:53,752 --> 02:36:55,754
we do for others.

1687
02:36:58,974 --> 02:37:01,368
We all share the same fate,

1688
02:37:01,542 --> 02:37:03,152
the same future.

1689
02:37:07,113 --> 02:37:11,117
The sum of our
infinite choices.

1690
02:37:12,466 --> 02:37:15,948
One such future is built
on kindness, trust

1691
02:37:16,122 --> 02:37:18,646
and mutual understanding...

1692
02:37:22,041 --> 02:37:23,390
should we choose

1693
02:37:23,564 --> 02:37:25,827
to accept it.

1694
02:37:28,917 --> 02:37:30,702
Driving without question...

1695
02:37:32,747 --> 02:37:35,446
towards a light we cannot see.

1696
02:37:38,797 --> 02:37:41,800
Not just for those
we hold close...

1697
02:37:45,368 --> 02:37:46,718
Hi, Mom.

1698
02:37:46,892 --> 02:37:49,460
...but for those
we’ll never meet.

1699
02:37:53,638 --> 02:37:57,337
I hope you know
I’ll always love you, brother.

1700
02:37:58,164 --> 02:38:00,340
And I will see you again.

1701
02:38:01,472 --> 02:38:03,256
Though I hope
it’s not too soon.

1702
02:38:10,045 --> 02:38:12,265
The world still needs you.

1703
02:38:13,701 --> 02:38:15,834
Of course,
they’ll never know it.

1704
02:38:16,008 --> 02:38:17,836
But we do.

1705
02:38:20,360 --> 02:38:22,623
We who live and die

1706
02:38:23,319 --> 02:38:25,408
in the shadows.

1707
02:38:26,801 --> 02:38:31,502
This message will self-destruct
in five seconds.

1708
02:38:32,851 --> 02:38:34,592
Good luck, Ethan.
