1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000


2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000


3
00:00:57,708 --> 00:01:02,083
JRAGUNG MARKET

4
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:04,833
This is how you make a ball.

5
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:06,416
Tie it tightly.

6
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:11,625
- It's done. Let's play!
- Yeah!

7
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:16,500
- Let's go.
- Abdi!

8
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,791
Be home before sunset, okay?

9
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:20,458
Yes, Dad!

10
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:21,833
Let's go!

11
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:36,333
It's getting dark. Let's go back.

12
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:38,041
We'll go later. You guys can go.

13
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:39,416
Come on then.

14
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:44,250
‪Come on, let's go home.

15
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:50,083
Oh, no.

16
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:52,250
Gosh, where did you kick it, Tris?

17
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,583
I think it's over here.

18
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:28,125
Let's leave it and come back tomorrow.
It's already dark.

19
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:30,375
Oh, come on, you.

20
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:36,083
Abdi, Sutrisno.

21
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:37,875
Come here.

22
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,375
Whose voice is that?

23
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:21,666
Come here.

24
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:33,875
Hey, my ball!

25
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:36,041
Tris! Gosh.

26
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,125
Oh, dear.

27
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,750
Tris!

28
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:50,125
Sutris! Where are you?

29
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:15,541
Dad! Dad, help! It's Sutrisno!

30
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:16,958
Dad!

31
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,333
- Abdi, where is he?
- Over there.

32
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:26,750
- Come on then.
- Come on!

33
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,583
Whose blood is this?

34
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,875
Over here in the river!

35
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,625
The river! Let's go!

36
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,625
The river. Go, hurry up!

37
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,500
Trisno!

38
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,041
My son!

39
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,458
Trisno, my son!

40
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:16,875
I insist.

41
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:20,291
We need to punish this boy.

42
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,583
He pushed my son off the cliff.

43
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,583
Don't you dare accuse him!

44
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:27,083
Dad, it was a girl.

45
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,791
A girl smashed Sutrisno's head
with a rock.

46
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,791
What girl?

47
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,208
Every child was already at home.

48
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:38,333
It wasn't me, Sir. I swear!

49
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,041
Please believe me.

50
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,583
You murderer!

51
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:43,500
Wait!

52
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,125
I believe you.

53
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,166
Mr. Sabdo?

54
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,833
That girl is still around.

55
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,375
Who do you mean?

56
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,375
Sumala.

57
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,250
Sumala?

58
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:02,958
Sumala.

59
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,250
The Devil's child.

60
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:12,083
It all started 29 years ago.

61
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:38,208
{\an8}Meneer Hansen sends his regards.

62
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:42,625
{\an8}He's glad that his daughter,
your wife, Soelastri,

63
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:48,541
{\an8}is taken care of and living in luxury.

64
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,041
{\an8}Please send him back my regards.

65
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:57,500
{\an8}Yes. Soelastri is my precious diamond.

66
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,791
{\an8}I'll never let go of her.

67
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:22,583
{\an8}You know your uncle and aunt

68
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,250
{\an8}have given most of their land

69
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,666
{\an8}for the development of our area.

70
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:35,375
{\an8}The people from the factory
have prepared everything.

71
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:42,375
{\an8}All they need now is your land.

72
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,375
{\an8}Uncle.

73
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,666
{\an8}We've talked about this many times.

74
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,958
{\an8}Yet you haven't made a decision.

75
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,708
{\an8}If you want to give it now,

76
00:07:56,958 --> 00:08:01,375
{\an8}we can still write up an agreement,
and you…

77
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:08,208
{\an8}can still get
partial profit from the factory.

78
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,958
{\an8}I've told you again and again, Uncle.

79
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:17,041
{\an8}I will never sell my land to anyone.

80
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:20,166
{\an8}It belongs to the Hasungkara family!

81
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:34,833
{\an8}Here.

82
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,083
{\an8}All the documents you need.

83
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,791
{\an8}I've taken care of the permit.

84
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,708
{\an8}Read it carefully.

85
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:52,625
{\an8}Wow.

86
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,083
{\an8}Uncle and Meneer.

87
00:08:57,041 --> 00:09:01,166
{\an8}Why didn't you tell us you were visiting?

88
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:05,166
{\an8}We could have prepared rooms for you.

89
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,750
{\an8}Here you go, dear.

90
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:11,333
{\an8}I'm not staying long.

91
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,666
{\an8}Your husband knows why I'm here.

92
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,666
{\an8}All right then, Uncle.

93
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,583
{\an8}Please enjoy.

94
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:23,666
{\an8}Please help yourself, Meneer.

95
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:37,000
{\an8}Wrap up what you need to say, Uncle.

96
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:41,416
{\an8}If only my wife were like Soelastri.

97
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,708
{\an8}In 11 years of marriage,

98
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:49,666
{\an8}I would have had eight children

99
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,166
{\an8}to secure the rights for the land.

100
00:09:56,458 --> 00:10:01,750
{\an8}So, whether it is
now or later without a will,

101
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:06,750
{\an8}I can take over all of
the land that belongs to Hastungkara.

102
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:14,125
{\an8}Time is our enemy, Soedjiman.

103
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:22,791
{\an8}Did your uncle give you a hard time again?

104
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,541
Don't wear that <i>kebaya</i> anymore.

105
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,666
Throw it away if needed.

106
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,166
I don't like it.

107
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,458
You gifted it to me, dear.

108
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,166
Where were you this morning?

109
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,541
The sun was up.

110
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,291
The market must have been crowded.

111
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:59,208
I went to get a herbal drink for my womb.

112
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,458
In a couple of months, I…

113
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,000
Find another way.

114
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,125
Please give me more time.

115
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:20,666
Why don't you let me talk to your uncle?

116
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,250
- Dear.
- What? What do you want?

117
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,125
Do you really think

118
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,625
that I can't face my greedy uncle?

119
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:48,375
- That's not what I mean.
- All this estate…

120
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,750
…that I inherited from my parents.

121
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,291
It is my hard work.

122
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:56,958
I will never give it away
to my greedy uncle.

123
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,541
Do you understand?

124
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
- Dear.
- I'm okay.

125
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:13,083
I can stand on my own.

126
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,083
You…

127
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,000
…take care of your womb.

128
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,375
Having a child

129
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:29,791
was also one of my parents' wishes.

130
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,500
If by next year

131
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,833
you still can't give me an heir,

132
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,000
I shall…

133
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,291
marry again.

134
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:10,875
- Hurry up.
- Why are you in such a rush?

135
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:15,875
Did you forget?
My wife can't get pregnant.

136
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,000
- She can't get pregnant?
- Yeah.

137
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,500
Then what?

138
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:23,250
I have to take her to Grandma Tukinah
in the other village.

139
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,333
Who is Grandma Tukinah?

140
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:30,375
An old lady who can make people pregnant.

141
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:32,875
Does it really work?

142
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,291
My wife says so.

143
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,083
- Really?
- Yes.

144
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:39,958
- Seriously?
- Yes.

145
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:54,541
This is Pak Yanto
who will take you across.

146
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,166
Madam.

147
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,083
Mr. Yanto?

148
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:10,166
Can you take these ladies across, Sir?

149
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:31,875
Ma'am?

150
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,375
Someone wants to see you.

151
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,416
Are you aware

152
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:52,125
that asking me for help

153
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:56,125
is not like asking other shamans for help?

154
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:02,833
My powers are different.

155
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:08,875
Black magic.

156
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:15,958
And you need to do a ritual.

157
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,541
This is a serious matter.

158
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,583
With this ritual,

159
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:24,208
you will be bound to my master.

160
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,125
Master?

161
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,041
Who is your master?

162
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,416
My master is…

163
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:34,666
the Devil.

164
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,625
If you want,

165
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:55,541
you can have two children at once.

166
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,125
Two?

167
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,250
But if you don't, it's all right.

168
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:10,625
I do.

169
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,541
There is a requirement.

170
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:18,875
What is it?

171
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:23,625
You will get pregnant with twins.

172
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:28,166
One will be beautiful and kind.
From the human race.

173
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,583
And the other,

174
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:34,375
will be ugly and wicked.
From the Devil's race.

175
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:37,791
When they are born,

176
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:42,083
you and your husband
must take care of them

177
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,375
until they are ten years old.

178
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,416
After that,

179
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,625
the ugly and wicked child will leave.

180
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:54,833
She'll be taken by her owner.

181
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:55,875
Yes.

182
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,458
The Devil himself.

183
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,250
However…

184
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:09,375
if you do not take care of them properly,

185
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:14,791
bad things will happen to your family.

186
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:21,500
Each year it will get worse.

187
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:27,583
Day and night will never be the same.

188
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:38,416
Oh, Devil.

189
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:44,083
There is a human here

190
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:51,791
who wants your help.

191
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:59,958
Unite her

192
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:04,708
with you.

193
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:13,250
Give her what she wants.

194
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:21,458
Bind her with you.

195
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:35,125
This woman now serves you.

196
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,041
In two months,

197
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:08,375
you will get pregnant.

198
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:19,750
{\an8}TWO MONTHS LATER

199
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,208
{\an8}Yes, you are pregnant.

200
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:27,541
You're pregnant with twins, Madam.

201
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,166
Thank you, darling.

202
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,833
Grandma Tukinah is amazing, isn't she?

203
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:56,250
She gave you a massage once…

204
00:20:58,625 --> 00:20:59,958
and now you're pregnant.

205
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:02,708
Later,

206
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,750
what shall we name them?

207
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,791
Boy or girl?

208
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,000
Girl.

209
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,791
Kumala.

210
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:26,625
And the other one?

211
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,333
Sumala.

212
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,500
Sumala.

213
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:41,708
Sukir?

214
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:48,916
Yes, Sir?

215
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,500
Tell the whole village.

216
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,916
My wife is pregnant

217
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,416
with my heir.

218
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:06,958
Ladies and gentlemen,

219
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:11,041
that concludes the bathing ceremony.

220
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:37,291
Yes, Madam. Breathe.

221
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:39,916
Madam, take a deep breath.

222
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,541
Gosh…

223
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:46,750
Sir.

224
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,875
Please wait outside, all right?

225
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:53,000
Darni and I will take good care of Madam.

226
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:54,958
Please excuse us.

227
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:00,833
Again, Madam. Breathe.

228
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:03,000
Madam…

229
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,541
Again, Madam.

230
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:08,791
Yes, Madam.

231
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:10,375
Breathe.

232
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:14,000
Yes, Madam. Just a little more.

233
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:15,916
Just a little more. Come on.

234
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,625
Come, Madam, once more.

235
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:19,666
- Okay.
- Keep going!

236
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:23,791
Breathe.

237
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:26,250
Keep going.

238
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:28,041
One more time, Madam.

239
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:29,666
Another one, Madam.

240
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:34,166
Breathe, just a little more, Madam.

241
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:38,958
Keep going, Madam. Keep going.

242
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:42,583
Yes. A little bit more.

243
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:44,916
Madam. Take a deep breath.

244
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,625
Yes, keep going, Madam!

245
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:48,833
Come on. Yes, yes.

246
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:56,125
Oh, dear.

247
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:57,250
- Aunt Sum.
- Yes?

248
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:58,458
Scissors, please.

249
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:12,875
Baby?

250
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,458
Baby?

251
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:21,333
Aunt Sum.

252
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:22,958
What is it?

253
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:25,666
It's nothing, Madam.

254
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:32,500
- Aunt Sum, please help.
- Yes.

255
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:34,541
Keep going.

256
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:37,375
- Come.
- Come on, Madam.

257
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:40,041
Careful.

258
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:42,916
Yes, Madam, keep going.

259
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,916
Come on, baby, cry.

260
00:24:45,958 --> 00:24:48,541
Just a little more. Keep going, Madam.

261
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:51,875
Just a little more…

262
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:53,583
Keep going.

263
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:55,583
Come on, Madam.

264
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:17,625
Please cry, baby.

265
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:21,333
- Cry.
- Is the baby here?

266
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:24,500
Yes, Sir.

267
00:25:33,916 --> 00:25:35,166
What is this, Aunt?

268
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:38,708
Well…

269
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:42,916
I…

270
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,166
What is that?

271
00:26:01,083 --> 00:26:02,416
I'm so sorry, Sir.

272
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:05,666
This baby is deformed.

273
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:08,583
Deformed?

274
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:10,000
Yes, Sir.

275
00:26:40,416 --> 00:26:41,416
Oh, dear. Sir!

276
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:44,958
Dear?

277
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:52,375
What is that for, dear?

278
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,458
Dear.

279
00:27:07,333 --> 00:27:08,333
No.

280
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:10,083
No…

281
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:14,666
No.

282
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,250
Dear.

283
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,791
No!

284
00:27:52,833 --> 00:27:54,125
Sir.

285
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:57,375
She's crying.

286
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:08,541
Sukir!

287
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,250
- Sukir!
- Yes, Sir.

288
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:14,208
Tell the whole village.

289
00:28:14,958 --> 00:28:16,875
My daughter has been born.

290
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:19,500
My heir.

291
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:23,125
Yes, Sir.

292
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,083
Let's learn how to walk.

293
00:28:37,166 --> 00:28:39,708
Like this. Straighten your legs.

294
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,375
Straighten your legs.
Walk that way. Straight.

295
00:28:43,458 --> 00:28:44,625
Come on, Kumala.

296
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,833
She's three years old,

297
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:49,583
but she can't talk yet,

298
00:28:49,666 --> 00:28:51,291
and can't walk either?

299
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:55,541
The other kids are already doing it.

300
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:59,833
It turns out
Soedjiman's life is not perfect.

301
00:29:00,833 --> 00:29:02,625
Excuse me, Sir.

302
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:06,708
Which cigars would you like
to serve to the guests?

303
00:29:07,958 --> 00:29:08,958
Oh, right.

304
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:11,916
Crippled?

305
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,583
I heard that when he was a boy,

306
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:18,458
Soedjiman was crippled.
He couldn't walk properly.

307
00:29:18,541 --> 00:29:20,166
It became the talk of the town.

308
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:23,541
After he grew up, he healed
after getting massaged by Mrs. Darmi.

309
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:26,500
They should take Kumala to Mrs. Darmi.

310
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:28,250
They did, but it didn't work.

311
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:40,166
Kumala.

312
00:29:40,791 --> 00:29:43,583
You've been playing
for two hours. Come inside.

313
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:44,708
Come.

314
00:29:49,625 --> 00:29:50,666
Kumala.

315
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:53,416
Dear.

316
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,875
That's enough, dear.

317
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,166
Kumala.

318
00:30:04,208 --> 00:30:06,000
No, that's dangerous!

319
00:30:14,791 --> 00:30:15,833
Enough!

320
00:30:22,291 --> 00:30:25,125
Stop it. Don't do that. Stop, Kumala!

321
00:30:25,208 --> 00:30:27,208
Miss Kumala, please stop.

322
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:29,333
Enough!

323
00:30:29,916 --> 00:30:30,958
Stop, Kumala!

324
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:34,833
- Get a rope.
- Yes, Sir.

325
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:39,708
- Sukir, no!
- Shut it.

326
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:46,833
No! No!

327
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:49,583
Dear, please don't!

328
00:30:49,666 --> 00:30:50,916
Don't!

329
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,458
She's out of her mind.

330
00:30:52,541 --> 00:30:53,375
She's crazy!

331
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:56,375
No! No!

332
00:30:56,458 --> 00:30:57,583
- Sir!
- Quiet!

333
00:30:57,666 --> 00:30:59,416
- Wait here!
- Please.

334
00:31:06,166 --> 00:31:07,208
Quiet.

335
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,083
{\an8}Kumala!

336
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:34,041
Kumala?

337
00:31:40,916 --> 00:31:42,333
No luck, Madam.

338
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:44,625
Did you look in the garden?

339
00:31:44,708 --> 00:31:45,791
Yes, Sir.

340
00:31:46,458 --> 00:31:49,041
The staff all went looking.
They can't find her.

341
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:58,708
Did you get it?

342
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:01,875
- Great!
- Here, here.

343
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:07,208
Who's that?

344
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:10,375
Mr. Soedjiman's daughter.

345
00:32:11,583 --> 00:32:12,583
Kumala.

346
00:32:13,416 --> 00:32:14,750
My dad works in their garden.

347
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,458
They say she's crazy.

348
00:32:21,291 --> 00:32:22,291
Hold this.

349
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:25,166
Kumala?

350
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:27,458
Come here.

351
00:32:27,541 --> 00:32:28,583
Look.

352
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:38,458
Come over here.

353
00:32:47,541 --> 00:32:48,875
- Go away!
- Yeah!

354
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:17,375
Sir.

355
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:20,125
I beg you, please.

356
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:22,458
- Sukir.
- Yes, Sir.

357
00:33:22,541 --> 00:33:24,166
Get my whip.

358
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:26,375
Yes, Sir.

359
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:31,041
We've already told you.

360
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:32,916
Do not leave the house.

361
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,041
And now you went to the market.

362
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:37,750
Embarrassing!

363
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,583
Here, Sir.

364
00:33:42,416 --> 00:33:43,875
Please don't, Sir.

365
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:45,708
Don't do it.

366
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:47,958
- Please don't, Sir.
- Get over here.

367
00:33:48,041 --> 00:33:49,791
Mom?

368
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:51,458
Dear.

369
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:57,083
Mom.

370
00:33:57,708 --> 00:33:58,583
Mom!

371
00:34:17,375 --> 00:34:19,000
Oh, dear God.

372
00:34:23,916 --> 00:34:27,083
- It hurts, Aunt.
- I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

373
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:31,875
It's done now.

374
00:34:38,625 --> 00:34:40,333
Let me cover it up.

375
00:34:48,125 --> 00:34:50,125
Don't be sad.

376
00:34:51,416 --> 00:34:53,333
Do you want to play the piano?

377
00:34:55,208 --> 00:34:56,833
Yes? Come.

378
00:34:56,916 --> 00:34:59,166
I'll walk you there.

379
00:35:00,541 --> 00:35:01,875
Be careful.

380
00:35:17,666 --> 00:35:19,000
Sweetheart.

381
00:35:23,541 --> 00:35:24,750
Kumala.

382
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:30,291
Tomorrow is your eighth birthday.

383
00:35:32,083 --> 00:35:34,041
I made you a present.

384
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:36,916
A present?

385
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,958
Yes.

386
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:53,875
- Thank you, Aunt.
- You're welcome.

387
00:35:53,958 --> 00:35:55,375
Do you like it?

388
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:05,375
My dearest.

389
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:09,291
I love you so much.

390
00:36:28,375 --> 00:36:29,458
<i>Kumala.</i>

391
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,666
<i>Kumala.</i>

392
00:36:57,833 --> 00:36:59,125
<i>Over here.</i>

393
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:31,541
Who are you?

394
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:35,666
I am Sumala.

395
00:37:41,833 --> 00:37:43,166
Your twin.

396
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:52,958
Didn't your parents tell you?

397
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:57,000
That you had a twin?

398
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:04,500
They are cruel!

399
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:06,125
They killed me…

400
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:07,500
because I was ugly!

401
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,875
Don't be afraid.

402
00:38:21,791 --> 00:38:24,666
I won't harm you.

403
00:38:27,291 --> 00:38:30,333
I love you, Kumala.

404
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Sisters do not hurt each other.

405
00:38:46,916 --> 00:38:49,083
We protect each other.

406
00:38:57,541 --> 00:38:58,625
Kumala.

407
00:39:00,666 --> 00:39:02,750
You want a friend, don't you?

408
00:39:05,166 --> 00:39:06,875
Look at me.

409
00:39:07,708 --> 00:39:09,541
I am your friend.

410
00:39:10,291 --> 00:39:12,166
Your best friend.

411
00:39:22,708 --> 00:39:24,833
From now on,

412
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:28,958
day and night will be different.

413
00:40:27,333 --> 00:40:29,208
You're being noisy!

414
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:34,000
It is late!

415
00:40:37,208 --> 00:40:38,708
Sir…

416
00:40:41,875 --> 00:40:43,250
Watch your daughter.

417
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,416
Yes, dear.

418
00:41:02,791 --> 00:41:05,125
- Aunt Sum.
- Yes, Madam.

419
00:41:13,916 --> 00:41:15,375
Miss Kumala?

420
00:41:19,958 --> 00:41:21,791
Be strong.

421
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,291
What now?

422
00:42:04,833 --> 00:42:05,958
What happened, dear?

423
00:42:11,291 --> 00:42:12,125
Sir…

424
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:17,291
No, I'm fine.

425
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:22,125
What is the matter with you?

426
00:42:37,708 --> 00:42:39,833
If you ever talk back to me again,

427
00:42:40,708 --> 00:42:44,458
I will punish you like this every day!

428
00:42:54,958 --> 00:42:55,833
Mom.

429
00:42:57,666 --> 00:42:58,625
Mom.

430
00:43:00,666 --> 00:43:02,791
How could you do that to your father?

431
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,666
- Mom.
- Enough.

432
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,500
- Just be quiet.
- Lastri!

433
00:43:08,625 --> 00:43:09,583
Mom…

434
00:43:19,958 --> 00:43:23,416
I made <i>gudeg.</i> Your favorite food, Kumala.

435
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,916
- I want some tea.
- Of course. Just a moment.

436
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:20,041
How rude!

437
00:44:21,041 --> 00:44:21,875
Sukir!

438
00:44:22,458 --> 00:44:23,666
- Rope!
- Yes, Sir!

439
00:44:25,208 --> 00:44:26,041
‪Come here.

440
00:44:26,125 --> 00:44:27,208
Get down.

441
00:44:32,541 --> 00:44:33,833
Let go!

442
00:44:34,916 --> 00:44:35,958
Stop, Kumala. That's enough!

443
00:44:42,875 --> 00:44:44,750
How dare…

444
00:44:49,833 --> 00:44:51,541
- Crazy girl!
- Kumala!

445
00:44:51,625 --> 00:44:53,000
Miss Kumala!

446
00:44:58,041 --> 00:44:59,000
Kumala?

447
00:44:59,083 --> 00:45:01,958
Miss Kumala? Where are you?

448
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,916
Miss Kumala?

449
00:45:11,666 --> 00:45:13,458
- Aunt Sum.
- Yes.

450
00:45:16,833 --> 00:45:20,333
Miss Kumala, what are you doing?

451
00:45:26,375 --> 00:45:27,875
Oh, God.

452
00:45:33,625 --> 00:45:34,791
Dear.

453
00:45:36,541 --> 00:45:38,125
Last night,

454
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:41,666
why did you behave like that?

455
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,791
Why were you so naughty?

456
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,166
It wasn't me who was naughty.

457
00:45:51,125 --> 00:45:52,208
But…

458
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,333
Sumala.

459
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,791
Sumala?

460
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:04,541
Who is Sumala?

461
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:11,041
Whose name did she say?

462
00:46:11,625 --> 00:46:13,375
Sumala, Madam.

463
00:46:20,208 --> 00:46:22,250
Madam, what is it?

464
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,375
Sukir, where is Madam going?

465
00:46:47,958 --> 00:46:51,208
I don't know. She said to the market.

466
00:46:51,291 --> 00:46:52,541
But she doesn't want me to take her.

467
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:55,291
That's it.

468
00:46:58,625 --> 00:47:01,541
Dear, can you help me out?

469
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:06,000
What is it? I'm eating well right now.

470
00:47:06,583 --> 00:47:07,833
While I'm here.

471
00:47:09,583 --> 00:47:12,000
I need to go after Madam.

472
00:47:12,083 --> 00:47:14,125
I need to get something at the market.

473
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:16,583
Can you watch Kumala?

474
00:47:17,791 --> 00:47:18,833
Okay.

475
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,375
All right then. Finish eating first.

476
00:47:50,125 --> 00:47:51,041
Sir?

477
00:47:53,083 --> 00:47:56,250
Can you take me to Grandma Tukinah?

478
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:00,833
Grandma Tukinah died last month.

479
00:48:02,041 --> 00:48:03,416
She died?

480
00:48:07,833 --> 00:48:08,875
She died…

481
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:12,750
Madam.

482
00:48:12,833 --> 00:48:14,000
Aunt Sum.

483
00:48:14,083 --> 00:48:15,166
Excuse me.

484
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,833
- I made a mistake.
- I understand.

485
00:48:18,541 --> 00:48:20,583
What mistake did you make?

486
00:48:24,666 --> 00:48:26,333
I made…

487
00:48:26,416 --> 00:48:28,541
a deal with the Devil.

488
00:48:29,125 --> 00:48:31,250
Oh, God.

489
00:48:33,708 --> 00:48:35,333
Oh, God.

490
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:42,791
No! I don't want to! No!

491
00:48:43,583 --> 00:48:46,416
No! Mr. Sukir, let me go!

492
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,958
No! Let go!

493
00:48:49,041 --> 00:48:50,500
No! No!

494
00:48:54,416 --> 00:48:55,750
Let go!

495
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:57,416
- Let's tie you up.
- No!

496
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:00,125
Tightly!

497
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,250
No! Let me go!

498
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:07,000
Be quiet.

499
00:49:08,541 --> 00:49:09,375
Be quiet.

500
00:49:10,416 --> 00:49:11,291
No!

501
00:49:12,833 --> 00:49:14,625
Shush, shush, shush.

502
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:18,416
Or I'll slit your throat.

503
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:43,291
Sir.

504
00:49:44,166 --> 00:49:45,291
I beg of you.

505
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,166
Please don't lock
Miss Kumala in the shed every night.

506
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:52,583
Do you want me to die then?

507
00:49:55,583 --> 00:49:58,625
The little girl stabbed me.

508
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:00,875
She attacked other people.

509
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:06,541
Every night she's
becoming more like an animal.

510
00:50:07,166 --> 00:50:09,916
Getting wilder and wilder.

511
00:50:12,583 --> 00:50:14,833
But the poor girl, Sir.

512
00:50:15,333 --> 00:50:16,500
Whatever.

513
00:50:17,375 --> 00:50:18,958
Don't give me orders.

514
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:38,041
Dear?

515
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:42,708
Dear?

516
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:44,291
Aunt?

517
00:50:46,208 --> 00:50:47,166
Aunt?

518
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,166
Don't be sad, all right?

519
00:50:51,708 --> 00:50:54,500
I don't care who you are.

520
00:50:56,333 --> 00:50:58,791
I will always love you, Kumala.

521
00:51:00,166 --> 00:51:01,250
All right?

522
00:51:35,166 --> 00:51:37,166
Kumala?

523
00:51:37,708 --> 00:51:40,000
Kumala?

524
00:51:47,458 --> 00:51:48,666
Shall we play?

525
00:51:49,541 --> 00:51:50,625
Come here!

526
00:51:51,375 --> 00:51:52,916
Look, a ball!

527
00:51:53,666 --> 00:51:56,583
Let's play over there.

528
00:51:56,666 --> 00:51:57,500
Over there.

529
00:52:10,875 --> 00:52:11,833
Whatever.

530
00:52:13,291 --> 00:52:15,125
Kumala.

531
00:52:15,208 --> 00:52:16,041
Kumala.

532
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:17,916
Try and kick it.

533
00:52:23,666 --> 00:52:26,333
Crippled, crippled, crippled!

534
00:52:26,416 --> 00:52:28,625
Crippled, crippled, crippled!

535
00:52:28,708 --> 00:52:32,291
Crippled, crippled, crippled!

536
00:52:32,375 --> 00:52:34,208
- Don't do that!
- Why?

537
00:52:34,291 --> 00:52:35,416
The poor thing.

538
00:52:36,583 --> 00:52:38,500
Look, she's crying.

539
00:52:40,875 --> 00:52:43,583
Stop it. Let's do this.

540
00:52:51,416 --> 00:52:53,791
She's a mess!

541
00:52:59,083 --> 00:53:00,708
Oh, God. Kumala!

542
00:53:00,791 --> 00:53:01,625
Hey!

543
00:53:02,416 --> 00:53:05,333
Hey, hey, hey!

544
00:53:05,416 --> 00:53:07,666
How can you boys be so naughty?

545
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:09,000
Stop it!

546
00:53:09,083 --> 00:53:11,000
Go away, all of you!

547
00:53:22,166 --> 00:53:23,208
Dear.

548
00:53:28,333 --> 00:53:30,666
Be strong.

549
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,083
It's okay.

550
00:53:57,666 --> 00:53:58,708
What is that?

551
00:54:08,125 --> 00:54:09,833
The usual.

552
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:14,875
Every night, all she does is wreak havoc.

553
00:54:15,458 --> 00:54:18,333
But it sounds louder than usual, dear.

554
00:54:57,166 --> 00:55:01,916
It's your fault. I told you
to get water since the sun was still up.

555
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,125
Okay, Mom. I'm getting it!

556
00:55:13,166 --> 00:55:14,250
Supri.

557
00:55:26,208 --> 00:55:28,041
Come play with me.

558
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:30,666
Gosh, who is it?

559
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:32,500
Why would you play so late at night?

560
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:51,916
That'll teach you to leave me alone.

561
00:56:49,041 --> 00:56:49,916
Karyo…

562
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:53,666
What now?

563
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:55,458
My mom is being weird.

564
00:56:55,541 --> 00:56:58,666
I'm sleepy, but she's making me do things.

565
00:56:58,750 --> 00:56:59,833
Well…

566
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:02,416
Your poor uncle, though.

567
00:57:02,916 --> 00:57:06,041
No one is there.
If we don't get him some food,

568
00:57:06,625 --> 00:57:07,666
he'll be even more sick.

569
00:57:09,083 --> 00:57:09,916
Sukro!

570
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,083
- Sukro?
- Sukro.

571
00:57:11,875 --> 00:57:13,208
Karyo.

572
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:17,166
Sukro!

573
00:57:43,625 --> 00:57:46,166
Son!

574
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:50,458
Son!

575
00:57:50,541 --> 00:57:52,041
Supri!

576
00:57:52,125 --> 00:57:53,833
- What do we do now?
- Son!

577
00:57:53,916 --> 00:57:55,583
Where else should we search?

578
00:57:55,666 --> 00:57:58,041
It's been three days since he disappeared.

579
00:57:58,125 --> 00:57:59,791
What has gotten into him?

580
00:57:59,875 --> 00:58:02,166
Why did he leave without telling us?

581
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:04,083
Sukro!

582
00:58:04,166 --> 00:58:06,458
- Sukro!
- Karyo!

583
00:58:06,541 --> 00:58:08,541
- Karyo!
- Sukro!

584
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:12,125
- Karyo!
- Sukro!

585
00:58:12,208 --> 00:58:13,750
<i>We'd like to give you a report, Chief.</i>

586
00:58:13,833 --> 00:58:16,708
We've searched here and there.

587
00:58:16,791 --> 00:58:19,041
All the way to the neighboring village.

588
00:58:19,125 --> 00:58:20,166
All right then.

589
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:24,416
Let's search around an even bigger area.

590
00:58:25,166 --> 00:58:28,166
I'll work with the other village chiefs.

591
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:30,416
Gentlemen!

592
00:58:30,916 --> 00:58:32,916
Please take care of your children.

593
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,833
Do not let them out
after sunset, all right?

594
00:58:35,916 --> 00:58:41,416
Yes, Sir!

595
00:58:43,958 --> 00:58:45,583
- Jono.
- Yeah?

596
00:58:45,666 --> 00:58:47,208
Are the dads still there?

597
00:58:47,916 --> 00:58:49,500
At the chief's house?

598
00:58:50,541 --> 00:58:53,541
I guess. Maybe until dawn?

599
00:58:55,541 --> 00:58:59,416
What if Supri, Karyo, and Sukro

600
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:01,458
got eaten by a crocodile?

601
00:59:02,666 --> 00:59:05,708
What if they got eaten by a tiger?

602
00:59:05,791 --> 00:59:09,041
What if it's not even a real tiger?

603
00:59:09,125 --> 00:59:11,583
Enough! Stop spitting nonsense.

604
00:59:12,166 --> 00:59:14,666
They're probably
just pulling a prank on us.

605
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:15,708
Impossible.

606
00:59:16,375 --> 00:59:17,875
Would they even go this far?

607
00:59:18,375 --> 00:59:20,666
Who knows?

608
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:22,333
My ball is gone.

609
00:59:22,416 --> 00:59:24,333
Who else dares to take it except them?

610
00:59:34,041 --> 00:59:35,208
Kumala?

611
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:36,833
Kumala?

612
00:59:51,208 --> 00:59:52,250
Come on.

613
00:59:56,166 --> 00:59:57,625
What are you doing?

614
00:59:58,583 --> 00:59:59,916
Do you want to play ball?

615
01:00:01,208 --> 01:00:02,416
All right.

616
01:00:04,583 --> 01:00:06,416
How will she kick it?

617
01:00:09,458 --> 01:00:10,708
I know, right?

618
01:00:15,166 --> 01:00:17,083
- Jon, what's wrong?
- Jon!

619
01:00:25,958 --> 01:00:27,791
What's that she's holding?

620
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:35,166
Hey, who are you looking for?

621
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,375
Listen to me when I'm talking to you!

622
01:00:45,083 --> 01:00:46,208
- Jono!
- How dare you!

623
01:00:46,291 --> 01:00:47,666
I'll kill you!

624
01:01:17,041 --> 01:01:18,083
Parto!

625
01:01:29,333 --> 01:01:30,208
No!

626
01:01:52,666 --> 01:01:54,958
Karyo!

627
01:01:55,041 --> 01:01:58,916
- Son!
- Sukro!

628
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,625
Where are you, Son?

629
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,166
Sarno!

630
01:02:05,125 --> 01:02:06,500
What is it?

631
01:02:06,583 --> 01:02:08,708
- Over there.
- What's over there?

632
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:11,416
Go on, then.

633
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,791
Open it. Uncover it!

634
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:20,750
- God, forgive us!
- What is this?

635
01:02:24,083 --> 01:02:25,250
Sukro!

636
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:27,750
Dear God, forgive us.

637
01:02:27,833 --> 01:02:30,208
- Sukro!
- There, there.

638
01:02:30,291 --> 01:02:32,291
Say your prayers.

639
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:52,291
What is this?

640
01:02:56,541 --> 01:02:57,583
What is this?

641
01:02:57,666 --> 01:02:59,500
Please help.

642
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:01,416
- What is this?
- What's wrong?

643
01:03:01,958 --> 01:03:03,333
- Have a look.
- Is it blood?

644
01:03:03,416 --> 01:03:05,541
There's a body.

645
01:03:05,625 --> 01:03:07,375
Sir, help!

646
01:03:07,458 --> 01:03:08,541
Help.

647
01:03:08,625 --> 01:03:11,291
Sir!

648
01:03:11,375 --> 01:03:12,333
Gosh, what is this?

649
01:03:12,416 --> 01:03:14,458
What is this…

650
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:17,291
- What's going on here?
- Out of the way.

651
01:03:17,916 --> 01:03:18,916
Sir.

652
01:03:23,958 --> 01:03:24,958
Sir!

653
01:03:29,291 --> 01:03:30,375
At the field.

654
01:03:30,916 --> 01:03:32,791
What? What is it?

655
01:03:34,375 --> 01:03:35,500
Let's go.

656
01:03:35,583 --> 01:03:38,041
Move. Move it, you. Move!

657
01:04:00,041 --> 01:04:01,791
There he is!

658
01:04:02,625 --> 01:04:04,833
Soedjiman!

659
01:04:04,916 --> 01:04:07,208
Come out, Soedjiman!

660
01:04:07,875 --> 01:04:08,875
What is this?

661
01:04:08,958 --> 01:04:10,583
Hey, Sukir! Where is Soedjiman?

662
01:04:10,666 --> 01:04:11,875
Where is he?!

663
01:04:12,875 --> 01:04:14,041
- There he is.
- Hurry!

664
01:04:17,208 --> 01:04:18,791
What is going on here?

665
01:04:18,875 --> 01:04:21,416
You killed our sons!

666
01:04:22,833 --> 01:04:24,083
Killed who?

667
01:04:24,166 --> 01:04:26,291
Nonsense!

668
01:04:26,375 --> 01:04:27,833
Where is the proof?

669
01:04:29,666 --> 01:04:31,041
Soedjiman.

670
01:04:31,125 --> 01:04:33,458
If it truly wasn't you,

671
01:04:33,541 --> 01:04:34,583
then who else did it?

672
01:04:35,208 --> 01:04:36,666
Was it your daughter?

673
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:39,083
This is the proof!

674
01:04:39,666 --> 01:04:42,083
I found it in the forest.

675
01:04:42,166 --> 01:04:45,375
- Right next to Sukro and Karyo's bodies!
- The young lady?

676
01:04:45,458 --> 01:04:46,875
Just admit it!

677
01:04:46,958 --> 01:04:49,208
This belongs to your daughter, right?

678
01:04:49,291 --> 01:04:50,791
Admit it, Soedjiman!

679
01:04:50,875 --> 01:04:52,875
She would never do such a thing.

680
01:04:52,958 --> 01:04:54,250
You have a crazy daughter!

681
01:04:54,333 --> 01:04:56,000
Yes, your daughter is crazy!

682
01:04:56,583 --> 01:04:57,583
Hey.

683
01:05:02,333 --> 01:05:04,083
Watch it.

684
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:06,041
Watch your mouth.

685
01:05:10,916 --> 01:05:12,000
Now go home.

686
01:05:13,083 --> 01:05:14,250
Go, all of you.

687
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:16,458
Back to your homes!

688
01:05:17,416 --> 01:05:20,875
I shall take this matter up to the chief.

689
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:23,000
Don't just point fingers!

690
01:05:23,083 --> 01:05:24,958
Go! Go back home!

691
01:05:25,041 --> 01:05:26,833
- Go.
- Scatter, all of you!

692
01:05:40,375 --> 01:05:41,583
That girl…

693
01:05:42,333 --> 01:05:44,291
She's in her room all day.

694
01:05:45,333 --> 01:05:46,916
She's in the shed all night.

695
01:05:49,041 --> 01:05:51,125
There's no way she could get out.

696
01:06:00,291 --> 01:06:02,333
<i>I need to make sure</i>

697
01:06:02,833 --> 01:06:06,500
<i>that when Kumala</i>
<i>is locked here every night,</i>

698
01:06:07,208 --> 01:06:09,166
<i>there is no way she can get out.</i>

699
01:06:33,458 --> 01:06:34,500
Lastri.

700
01:06:48,916 --> 01:06:51,833
Kumala would never do this.

701
01:06:55,333 --> 01:06:56,666
It wasn't Kumala.

702
01:06:58,750 --> 01:07:00,125
It's Sumala.

703
01:07:03,333 --> 01:07:04,833
Who is Suma…

704
01:07:11,041 --> 01:07:12,333
No!

705
01:07:19,583 --> 01:07:22,166
Kumala mentioned that name, dear.

706
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:27,375
And I've seen it with my own eyes.

707
01:07:29,333 --> 01:07:31,375
She looked exactly like Kumala.

708
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:35,000
But she's not crippled.

709
01:07:37,083 --> 01:07:38,458
She moved oddly.

710
01:07:39,375 --> 01:07:41,541
And she's always behind Kumala.

711
01:07:43,041 --> 01:07:45,500
Then why didn't you tell me?

712
01:07:46,041 --> 01:07:47,291
Why tell me now?

713
01:07:48,791 --> 01:07:50,333
You should have raised her.

714
01:07:50,916 --> 01:07:52,625
Not kill her!

715
01:07:53,625 --> 01:07:55,583
This is all your fault!

716
01:07:55,666 --> 01:07:57,500
Everything is a mess!

717
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:08,458
Kumala.

718
01:08:09,208 --> 01:08:11,208
I want to ask you.

719
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:15,791
Was it Sumala

720
01:08:16,416 --> 01:08:19,125
who killed those boys?

721
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:21,750
Was it?

722
01:08:26,708 --> 01:08:28,583
I won't get mad.

723
01:08:29,916 --> 01:08:31,666
I promise.

724
01:08:37,833 --> 01:08:38,916
Yes.

725
01:08:39,916 --> 01:08:41,416
Sumala.

726
01:08:47,916 --> 01:08:49,583
I told her not to.

727
01:08:50,875 --> 01:08:52,291
But she wanted to kill

728
01:08:53,416 --> 01:08:56,125
everyone who was mean to me.

729
01:09:02,916 --> 01:09:03,791
<i>Sukir!</i>

730
01:09:05,333 --> 01:09:06,291
Sukir!

731
01:09:08,125 --> 01:09:09,041
Yes, Sir?

732
01:09:10,958 --> 01:09:12,375
Shackle Kumala.

733
01:09:14,208 --> 01:09:15,458
Shackle?

734
01:09:15,541 --> 01:09:16,666
Yes.

735
01:09:17,791 --> 01:09:18,916
Right now.

736
01:09:20,375 --> 01:09:22,291
Yes, Sir.

737
01:09:25,833 --> 01:09:26,875
Dear.

738
01:09:28,916 --> 01:09:31,333
Where are you going, dear?

739
01:09:31,416 --> 01:09:32,833
I have to go.

740
01:09:33,791 --> 01:09:36,416
It's time to ask for Mr. Kusno's help.

741
01:09:38,166 --> 01:09:40,250
But he's so far away. I'll come with you.

742
01:09:41,083 --> 01:09:43,666
No. You should stay here.

743
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:45,125
Watch your daughter.

744
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:48,333
Dear.

745
01:09:49,041 --> 01:09:50,416
I'm scared.

746
01:09:53,916 --> 01:09:55,208
Don't be afraid.

747
01:09:56,375 --> 01:09:58,125
Sukir is here.

748
01:10:26,375 --> 01:10:27,375
Kumala.

749
01:10:32,916 --> 01:10:35,166
How did this happen, my dear?

750
01:10:54,291 --> 01:10:55,375
Aunt.

751
01:10:57,916 --> 01:10:59,625
Tomorrow is my birthday.

752
01:11:01,916 --> 01:11:04,125
- I'll be ten.
- Yes.

753
01:11:04,208 --> 01:11:05,375
I remember.

754
01:11:06,625 --> 01:11:11,250
But I haven't made you a present.

755
01:11:13,208 --> 01:11:14,958
What do you want?

756
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:19,458
I want you to leave right now.

757
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:20,958
Right now. Go far, far away.

758
01:11:21,583 --> 01:11:23,166
Okay? Far away.

759
01:11:24,291 --> 01:11:25,708
What do you mean?

760
01:11:26,583 --> 01:11:28,666
I don't want any harm to come to you.

761
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:31,333
Okay? You should go. Now.

762
01:11:34,416 --> 01:11:36,291
If I leave,

763
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,666
who's going to take care of you, my dear?

764
01:11:46,416 --> 01:11:47,708
Thank you, Aunt.

765
01:11:50,416 --> 01:11:52,791
For always being kind to me.

766
01:11:55,458 --> 01:11:58,875
I love you so much.

767
01:12:03,416 --> 01:12:04,291
My dear.

768
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:10,958
I love you so much, Kumala.

769
01:12:32,375 --> 01:12:34,541
May God bless you with strength, my dear.

770
01:12:36,041 --> 01:12:38,000
Take care, sweetheart.

771
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:43,333
Mother?

772
01:12:44,166 --> 01:12:45,583
Where are you going?

773
01:12:45,666 --> 01:12:47,750
We have to leave this house.

774
01:12:49,458 --> 01:12:50,541
Leave?

775
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:52,333
But why?

776
01:12:53,208 --> 01:12:54,791
I'll tell you later.

777
01:12:55,458 --> 01:12:56,291
Let's go.

778
01:12:58,791 --> 01:12:59,916
Come.

779
01:13:07,458 --> 01:13:09,000
Here. Eat up.

780
01:13:10,916 --> 01:13:11,958
It's not good.

781
01:13:15,583 --> 01:13:16,708
You little…

782
01:13:17,541 --> 01:13:19,208
How can you not like good food?

783
01:13:19,791 --> 01:13:20,875
What do you like?

784
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:22,458
That?

785
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:25,500
What are you eating?

786
01:13:25,583 --> 01:13:29,541
Whatever. You'll get a stomachache later.

787
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:09,083
Yes, this is good.

788
01:14:12,875 --> 01:14:13,750
It's savory.

789
01:14:16,458 --> 01:14:17,833
Crazy girl.

790
01:14:24,208 --> 01:14:27,500
<i>To the ruler of everything</i>

791
01:14:28,375 --> 01:14:35,291
<i>There is a soul without feeling</i>

792
01:14:35,375 --> 01:14:40,541
<i>Which makes the body and soul</i>

793
01:14:40,625 --> 01:14:44,666
<i>Unstable</i>

794
01:14:52,791 --> 01:14:53,875
What is it?

795
01:14:55,416 --> 01:14:57,833
What did your wife do?

796
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:05,083
She made a deal with the Devil

797
01:15:05,666 --> 01:15:08,083
just so she could get pregnant.

798
01:15:13,125 --> 01:15:15,375
She carried twins.

799
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:18,833
A pretty girl, human.

800
01:15:19,666 --> 01:15:22,708
And an ugly girl, the Devil's child.

801
01:15:24,458 --> 01:15:27,125
You were supposed to raise both of them

802
01:15:27,875 --> 01:15:29,958
until they were ten years old.

803
01:15:30,583 --> 01:15:31,833
After that,

804
01:15:32,541 --> 01:15:36,291
the ugly girl would be taken by the Devil.

805
01:15:36,375 --> 01:15:38,458
And the rest of you would live happily.

806
01:15:46,291 --> 01:15:48,291
Instead, you chose to kill her.

807
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:51,708
The Devil is furious.

808
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,666
Then what should I do?

809
01:16:11,666 --> 01:16:13,291
Later at midnight,

810
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:16,625
it will be dangerous.

811
01:16:18,458 --> 01:16:21,250
Kumala will turn ten years old.

812
01:16:23,083 --> 01:16:26,583
She will be
completely possessed by Sumala.

813
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:30,875
Day will be just like night.

814
01:16:32,041 --> 01:16:34,375
There is no difference.

815
01:16:46,333 --> 01:16:50,250
Is there a way

816
01:16:51,833 --> 01:16:53,583
that is possible

817
01:16:54,416 --> 01:16:57,250
for my daughter to be saved?

818
01:16:59,541 --> 01:17:02,333
We need to get
Sumala out of Kumala's body.

819
01:17:03,458 --> 01:17:04,500
If not,

820
01:17:05,416 --> 01:17:09,916
Kumala will forever be
Sumala, the Devil's child.

821
01:17:31,083 --> 01:17:33,291
Use my keris if she fights back.

822
01:17:34,166 --> 01:17:35,666
It can weaken her.

823
01:17:36,458 --> 01:17:39,083
Bring her here. I shall prepare a ritual

824
01:17:39,583 --> 01:17:42,125
to get Sumala out of Kumala.

825
01:17:45,541 --> 01:17:48,041
But if it's too late,

826
01:17:49,458 --> 01:17:52,750
you must stab her.

827
01:17:57,208 --> 01:17:58,916
Right in her heart.

828
01:18:04,333 --> 01:18:06,833
We cannot let
a Devil's child live in this world.

829
01:18:18,166 --> 01:18:22,125
<i>Sukir…</i>

830
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:27,250
Crazy girl.

831
01:18:50,208 --> 01:18:53,458
Hey, what are you doing there?

832
01:18:56,166 --> 01:18:59,458
How did you get out of your shackles?

833
01:19:07,208 --> 01:19:10,708
Oh, you're pretending to cry?

834
01:19:11,625 --> 01:19:13,208
You're playing games with me?

835
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:57,916
Crazy girl.

836
01:20:24,083 --> 01:20:25,791
No. No!

837
01:20:31,208 --> 01:20:32,375
No!

838
01:20:59,208 --> 01:21:00,916
Please.

839
01:21:02,958 --> 01:21:04,458
Please don't.

840
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,250
Shut it!

841
01:21:06,833 --> 01:21:08,375
I'm going to slit your throat.

842
01:21:25,541 --> 01:21:27,250
I'll do it slowly, okay?

843
01:21:28,916 --> 01:21:30,875
So it hurts even more.

844
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:36,291
Forgive me, kid.

845
01:22:21,458 --> 01:22:22,541
Kumala.

846
01:22:25,791 --> 01:22:27,208
Kumala who?

847
01:22:38,833 --> 01:22:39,916
Dear.

848
01:22:46,833 --> 01:22:47,875
Dear.

849
01:24:03,916 --> 01:24:05,375
Mom.

850
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,416
Let's play.

851
01:24:09,250 --> 01:24:11,375
Let's play and chop some meat.

852
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:13,541
You whore.

853
01:24:14,125 --> 01:24:16,458
Whore, whore. The Devil's wife!

854
01:24:16,541 --> 01:24:20,708
You're a whore! A whore! The Devil's wife!

855
01:24:55,083 --> 01:24:56,916
Kumala, no.

856
01:26:21,333 --> 01:26:22,791
One more leg. Okay, Mom?

857
01:26:24,541 --> 01:26:27,000
Why are you shaking your head?
Does it hurt?

858
01:26:29,083 --> 01:26:31,916
It hurt too, when I was stabbed.

859
01:26:34,708 --> 01:26:35,708
I'm sorry.

860
01:26:35,791 --> 01:26:38,458
You didn't take care
of your daughter properly.

861
01:26:40,583 --> 01:26:42,875
I wanted to raise you, dear.

862
01:26:42,958 --> 01:26:46,375
Your father killed you. Not me!

863
01:26:46,958 --> 01:26:49,208
Then why didn't you treat Kumala well?

864
01:26:50,041 --> 01:26:51,791
Everything I did,

865
01:26:52,458 --> 01:26:54,416
I did it to protect Kumala.

866
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:56,291
To protect Kumala,

867
01:26:56,375 --> 01:26:58,041
or yourself?

868
01:27:03,583 --> 01:27:04,875
I understand.

869
01:27:07,708 --> 01:27:09,250
I was wrong.

870
01:27:15,916 --> 01:27:20,041
Can I please talk to Kumala?

871
01:27:38,250 --> 01:27:40,250
- Mom?
- Kumala.

872
01:27:41,625 --> 01:27:42,541
Mom.

873
01:27:43,416 --> 01:27:45,625
Mom.

874
01:27:48,333 --> 01:27:49,333
Mom.

875
01:27:51,666 --> 01:27:54,000
Please forgive me, dear.

876
01:27:59,916 --> 01:28:01,166
I failed

877
01:28:04,708 --> 01:28:06,750
to be a good mother to you.

878
01:28:19,625 --> 01:28:21,708
I am so sorry, my dear.

879
01:28:28,166 --> 01:28:29,625
I forgive you, Mom.

880
01:28:44,333 --> 01:28:45,333
But I don't.

881
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:45,166
Lastri.

882
01:29:46,041 --> 01:29:46,916
Lastri!

883
01:29:54,666 --> 01:29:55,666
Lastri!

884
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:57,500
Lastri…

885
01:30:04,833 --> 01:30:06,416
Lastri!

886
01:30:14,208 --> 01:30:16,333
This is my fault.

887
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:24,416
This is my fault!

888
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:46,666
Please forgive me, darling.

889
01:31:39,708 --> 01:31:40,750
Dad.

890
01:31:44,666 --> 01:31:45,833
Help me, Dad.

891
01:32:06,791 --> 01:32:08,750
Dad, did you forget about me?

892
01:33:56,875 --> 01:33:58,583
Becoming a cripple again, Dad?

893
01:34:11,166 --> 01:34:13,083
JRAGUNG VILLAGE

894
01:34:37,916 --> 01:34:39,166
Mr. Soedjiman?

895
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,458
- What is it, Sir?
- What's wrong?

896
01:34:42,291 --> 01:34:43,666
My wife…

897
01:34:47,583 --> 01:34:49,041
died.

898
01:34:49,125 --> 01:34:51,416
Indeed, to Allah we belong
and to Him we shall return.

899
01:34:53,375 --> 01:34:54,583
How come?

900
01:34:56,208 --> 01:34:58,291
Oh, God, forgive us!

901
01:34:58,375 --> 01:35:00,625
Who would do such a thing?

902
01:35:00,708 --> 01:35:02,416
- Sukir!
- God, forgive us!

903
01:35:03,125 --> 01:35:05,583
All right then. Gentlemen!

904
01:35:05,666 --> 01:35:06,791
Check the area.

905
01:35:06,875 --> 01:35:09,333
You, and you, with me.

906
01:35:09,416 --> 01:35:11,250
- Let's go.
- Yes!

907
01:35:17,833 --> 01:35:20,708
Oh, God.

908
01:35:23,083 --> 01:35:24,750
Oh, dear God.

909
01:35:30,750 --> 01:35:33,125
What happened here?

910
01:35:35,666 --> 01:35:36,500
Kuma…

911
01:35:37,208 --> 01:35:38,083
Kumala.

912
01:35:38,166 --> 01:35:40,416
Kumala did all of this?

913
01:35:40,958 --> 01:35:43,708
No. Not Kumala!

914
01:35:44,291 --> 01:35:46,250
But…

915
01:35:47,041 --> 01:35:49,166
We must find her.

916
01:35:49,833 --> 01:35:52,166
We must find Kumala!

917
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,875
Find her!

918
01:35:56,833 --> 01:35:59,000
Then it is true.

919
01:35:59,958 --> 01:36:01,958
Kumala was the one who killed our sons!

920
01:36:02,041 --> 01:36:04,416
- No!
- That's right!

921
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:06,541
- Not her!
- Let's go get her!

922
01:36:07,666 --> 01:36:09,416
Let's get her!

923
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:11,958
No! Sir…

924
01:36:12,041 --> 01:36:13,375
It wasn't Kumala.

925
01:36:14,458 --> 01:36:16,833
It's not Kumala! Not her.

926
01:36:16,916 --> 01:36:18,750
It wasn't Kumala!

927
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,083
Kumala!

928
01:36:24,166 --> 01:36:25,875
Keep looking until we find her!

929
01:36:25,958 --> 01:36:28,333
Kumala!

930
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:30,208
Kumala!

931
01:40:34,291 --> 01:40:35,375
Kumala.

932
01:40:41,583 --> 01:40:43,416
I am so sorry.

933
01:40:46,583 --> 01:40:48,416
For everything I did wrong.

934
01:40:52,125 --> 01:40:53,416
Come with me.

935
01:40:54,833 --> 01:40:57,875
I'll take you to Mr. Kusno to heal you.

936
01:41:08,875 --> 01:41:10,750
Crippled.

937
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:16,208
You were humiliated.

938
01:41:16,916 --> 01:41:20,333
Then you were healed,
and you were perfect.

939
01:41:21,583 --> 01:41:24,125
But then your daughter is crippled!

940
01:41:26,750 --> 01:41:28,541
If you hated the way

941
01:41:28,625 --> 01:41:31,500
your parents treated
you horribly back then,

942
01:41:31,583 --> 01:41:34,791
you shouldn't have treated
your daughter the same way.

943
01:41:36,208 --> 01:41:39,625
If you longed
for your parents' love back then,

944
01:41:40,291 --> 01:41:42,375
your daughter longed for it too.

945
01:41:48,208 --> 01:41:52,416
There is nothing
perfect in this world, Dad.

946
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:59,083
Yes, cry your heart out, Dad.

947
01:41:59,166 --> 01:42:00,833
It's okay.

948
01:42:00,916 --> 01:42:02,166
Cry.

949
01:44:56,291 --> 01:44:58,833
Since I possessed Kumala's body,

950
01:44:59,833 --> 01:45:01,583
my teeth have turned into fangs,

951
01:45:04,125 --> 01:45:06,250
my eyes turned white,

952
01:45:08,041 --> 01:45:09,208
and my heart

953
01:45:10,458 --> 01:45:11,750
is no longer here.

954
01:45:15,750 --> 01:45:17,333
But over here.

955
01:46:32,625 --> 01:46:33,750
Any luck, Sir?

956
01:46:33,833 --> 01:46:35,291
We couldn't find Kumala.

957
01:46:35,875 --> 01:46:38,041
- And Mr. Soedjiman?
- We can't find him.

958
01:46:38,125 --> 01:46:39,416
‪Oh, no.

959
01:46:42,208 --> 01:46:43,250
The corn field. Let's go!

960
01:46:43,333 --> 01:46:45,083
- Let's go!
- To the corn field!

961
01:46:48,291 --> 01:46:49,625
- Sabdo.
- Sabdo!

962
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:52,958
What is it?

963
01:46:54,041 --> 01:46:55,291
- Sabdo.
- That's…

964
01:46:55,375 --> 01:46:57,000
What is it, Sabdo?

965
01:46:57,083 --> 01:46:58,166
Look.

966
01:47:00,250 --> 01:47:03,333
- Oh, dear God.
- God, forgive us.

967
01:47:03,416 --> 01:47:05,000
Mr. Soedjiman!

968
01:47:05,083 --> 01:47:08,625
Indeed, to Allah we belong
and to Him we shall return.

969
01:47:18,666 --> 01:47:20,625
- What happened?
- Grandpa Kusno died.

970
01:47:20,708 --> 01:47:22,958
- How?
- I don't know. Maybe he's sick?

971
01:47:24,375 --> 01:47:25,500
It's horrible.

972
01:47:25,583 --> 01:47:27,875
- Oh, God.
- What is it?

973
01:47:27,958 --> 01:47:29,458
Grandpa Kusno.

974
01:47:43,333 --> 01:47:46,916
<i>Nobody could ever tame Kumala</i>
<i>once she was possessed by Sumala.</i>

975
01:47:47,666 --> 01:47:49,333
<i>Since then,</i>

976
01:47:49,416 --> 01:47:51,208
<i>she has never been found.</i>

977
01:47:53,583 --> 01:47:55,583
That is why I keep saying this.

978
01:47:56,166 --> 01:47:59,541
Everyone must be home before the sun sets.

979
01:47:59,625 --> 01:48:01,708
- Okay, Sir.
- Never leave the house at night.

980
01:48:02,250 --> 01:48:03,958
Or Sumala will hunt you down.

981
01:48:04,041 --> 01:48:05,125
Sumala?

982
01:48:05,208 --> 01:48:06,291
Especially

983
01:48:06,375 --> 01:48:08,791
the kids who are
still playing in the dark.

984
01:48:32,375 --> 01:48:33,750
BASED ON A TRUE STORY

985
01:48:33,833 --> 01:48:38,041
PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT SUMALA
IS STILL LIVING AMONG THE FORESTS

986
01:48:38,125 --> 01:48:42,208
IN THE SEMARANG REGENCY

987
01:48:42,291 --> 01:48:45,458
TO THIS DAY, CHILDREN ARE ADVISED
TO STAY AT HOME AFTER SUNSET

988
01:48:45,541 --> 01:48:49,125
Dear, did you not
put out offerings like everyone else?

989
01:48:49,208 --> 01:48:50,541
I don't believe it!

990
01:48:51,208 --> 01:48:53,708
Sutrisno died because of Abdi.

991
01:48:56,375 --> 01:48:57,750
Not because of that girl.
