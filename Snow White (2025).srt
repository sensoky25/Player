00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:15,458
opinionated.

176
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,041
My apologies. It's just...

177
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,333
I feel they need some kindness.

178
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:32,583
"Fearless, fair, brave, true."

179
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:35,375
How quaint.

180
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:40,458
One day, you'll understand
how useless those words are.

181
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,208
But in the meantime,

182
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,416
here's a tidbit for you.

183
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,291
Observe.

184
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,833
Ravishing, isn't it?

185
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:53,958
Yes, Your Majesty.

186
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,125
One is weak, useless, fragile.

187
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:03,333
The other hard, unyielding,

188
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,750
everlasting, flawless,

189
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,583
beautiful.

190
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,958
My subjects don't want a flower.

191
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,208
They want a diamond.

192
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,291
[footsteps approaching]

193
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,375
- Your Highness...
- Get your hands off me!

194
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:22,416
...this criminal was caught
in the scullery pilfering royal supplies.

195
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,791
That's a lie.

196
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,875
Are you one of the bandits

197
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:36,708
that gather in the forest
stealing in the name of the king?

198
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,166
[thief] No, no, Your Majesty.

199
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,000
Not "one of the bandits." I'm the boss.

200
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,750
Loyal to the one true king.

201
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,833
Find his home and burn it to the ground.

202
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,541
Funny thing is,

203
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:49,625
I don't actually have a home.

204
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,416
Then take him to the dungeon.

205
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,250
- Fill the castle with his cries.
- Your Majesty...

206
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,250
I understand the need for justice.

207
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,750
But please, this isn't fair.

208
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,375
What did you say?

209
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:11,958
The punishment must not exceed the crime,

210
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,500
- and I know my father would...
- [Evil Queen] Your father?

211
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:16,666
Your father?

212
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,500
My father would show mercy.

213
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,916
I'm sorry, my dear. You're right.

214
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:31,458
This thief stole from me.

215
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:34,000
So, I will steal from him.

216
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:37,291
Remove his coat and boots
and bind him to the gates to freeze.

217
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:38,791
You know, is the dungeon still an option?

218
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,333
Take him away!

219
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,666
Wait, he'll perish. Please, Your Majesty.

220
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,750
Snow White!

221
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,750
Here...

222
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:48,125
look at yourself.

223
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,625
Isn't this what you want?

224
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:52,916
Go on,

225
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
speak to your people.

226
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,875
Your subjects await you, Snow White.

227
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:03,125
Your pies and your wise words.

228
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,583
What will you tell them, hmm?

229
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,750
That you've made them dessert?

230
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,083
You live in a world of wishes.

231
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,708
Go back to your well, Snow White.

00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:05,000
Or make himself big and roar?

520
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,416
[Doc] Depends what kind of ogre.

521
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,625
[Grumpy] It's not an ogre!

522
00:33:07,708 --> 00:33:08,833
[Bashful] It's a demon goat.

523
00:33:08,916 --> 00:33:10,166
[Sneezy] Don't look it in the eyes.

524
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,791
[Doc] If you see ectoplasm,

525
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:13,958
- don't touch it.
- [Sneezy] Is it floating?

526
00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:15,541
[Bashful] Be careful, Dopey.

527
00:33:28,708 --> 00:33:30,583
[gasps and screams]

528
00:33:30,666 --> 00:33:32,750
[miners clamoring]

529
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:35,750
- [running footsteps]
- [panicked chatter]

530
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:37,041
[door shuts]

531
00:33:52,541 --> 00:33:53,833
Don't be afraid.

532
00:33:56,958 --> 00:33:58,125
It's all right.

533
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:03,291
I only wanted to meet you.

534
00:34:07,541 --> 00:34:08,666
What's your name?

535
00:34:12,291 --> 00:34:13,541
Don't you speak?

536
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:15,375
[Grumpy] Let's take back our friend!

537
00:34:15,458 --> 00:34:17,166
[miners yelling]

538
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,041
Wait, wait. Please.

539
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:20,833
- Why...
- It's a human.

540
00:34:21,416 --> 00:34:23,208
Well, yes. What did you think I was?

541
00:34:23,291 --> 00:34:24,333
- Nothing.
- Ghost.

542
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:26,750
- But where did you come from?
- [Bashful] Are you hungry?

543
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:27,916
Can we be friends?

544
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,125
What's your name?

545
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:30,583
[Grumpy] Why is everyone being so cordial?

546
00:34:30,666 --> 00:34:33,875
The only human things that come
into the forest anymore are bandits

547
00:34:33,958 --> 00:34:36,833
- who claim to fight in the king's name.
- What?

548
00:34:36,916 --> 00:34:39,333
You're in trouble with the law, aren't ya?

549
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:41,791
Hmm?

550
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:43,458
- I'd better go.
- Told ya.

551
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:45,708
- No, no, no. Wait, wait. Hold on.
- [Grumpy] Let her leave.

552
00:34:45,791 --> 00:34:47,958
Well, at least tell us who you are.

553
00:34:48,041 --> 00:34:49,166
- [Happy] Yeah.
- [Doc] Yes.

554
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,916
My name is Snow White.

555
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:56,416
- Snow White?
- [Bashful] The princess?

556
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,583
I say it's a trap.

557
00:34:57,666 --> 00:34:58,666
But she needs our help.

558
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:01,916
- [Grumpy] Anyone still think she's a ghost?
- Wait, wait, wait. Where are you going?

559
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,041
As far away from the castle as possible.

560
00:35:04,125 --> 00:35:05,541
- [Grumpy] That's not good enough.
- [Doc] But why?

561
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:11,458
The truth is, the queen tried to kill me.

562
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:13,958
- [Bashful gasps]
- She really tried to kill you?

563
00:35:14,041 --> 00:35:15,291
Well, that's terrible.

564
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:18,208
It's also exactly why you have to leave.

565
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:20,583
You should stay here until you figure out
where you're gonna go.

566
00:35:20,666 --> 00:35:23,000
- What?
- I think that's a wonderful idea.

567
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:24,083
[Grumpy] Now, hold on.

568
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:26,541
A human shows up in this cottage
for the first time

569
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:27,958
in 275 years

570
00:35:28,041 --> 00:35:29,416
and you ask her to stay?

571
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,000
Did he just say

572
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:32,791
275 years?

573
00:35:32,875 --> 00:35:35,500
274, to be precise.

574
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:37,250
We're as old as the trees.

575
00:35:37,791 --> 00:35:40,416
My parents always said
this forest was a magical place.

576
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,458
And I've always said
that humans cause nothing but trouble.

577
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,125
I'm sorry. I don't know your name.

578
00:35:45,958 --> 00:35:48,750
Allow me to introduce
in alphabetical order.

579
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:50,458
Bashful. Dopey.

580
00:35:50,541 --> 00:35:52,000
Grumpy. Happy.

581
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:53,458
Sleepy. Sneezy.

582
00:35:53,541 --> 00:35:54,916
And I'm Doc.

583
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,875
You said we were doing
reverse alphabetical order this time.

584
00:35:57,958 --> 00:35:59,333
That was last time.

585
00:35:59,416 --> 00:36:00,875
So, in reverse order,

586
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:03,875
it's Sneezy, Sleepy, Happy, Grumpy,
Dopey, Doc, and Bashful.

587
00:36:03,958 --> 00:36:05,666
Well, I'll be.

588
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,166
How did she do that?

589
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:09,958
My mother always taught me
that it was important to learn a name.

590
00:36:10,041 --> 00:36:12,458
Well, in order of the longest toes
to the shortest toes,

591
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:13,916
I have the longest toes.

592
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:16,750
If that helps.

593
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:20,333
And what exactly do you do
out here in the forest?

594
00:36:20,416 --> 00:36:23,416
Oh. Well, it's our job to mine the mines.

595
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,083
You'd be amazed at what you can find.

596
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:27,000
Sparkling rocks of every kind.

597
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:28,541
A place where magic still abides.

598
00:36:28,625 --> 00:36:30,666
Not for long if she resides!

599
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,166
Look at the time.

600
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:38,458
The important thing is that Snow White
is out of harm's way at our address.

601
00:36:38,541 --> 00:36:39,833
- Right, fellas?
- [Sneezy] Yeah.

602
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:41,583
- Absolutely.
- Objection.

603
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:43,500
- Noted. Just ignore him.
- [Sleepy snoring]

604
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:46,041
[thunder booms]

605
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:51,083
Maybe I'll just stay for one night.

606
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:52,958
One night. Then she leaves.

607
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:55,333
- You can come here.
- What size are your slippers?

608
00:36:55,416 --> 00:36:57,791
- I love slumber parties.
- We got some spare upstairs.

609
00:36:57,875 --> 00:36:59,750
[Doc] You'll be safe from the queen here.

610
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:01,333

Far beyond the castle wall,

615
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,250
somewhere in the woods dwells

616
00:37:20,791 --> 00:37:22,708
Snow White,

617
00:37:22,791 --> 00:37:24,916
fairest one of all.

618
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,916
No.

619
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,833
I am only bound by what is true.

620
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:31,333
The fairest lives.

621
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:33,916

Just because his name is Dopey

697

doesn't mean he's actually a dope.

Well, then, maybe we can start
with something small.

740
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:25,583
When I was a little girl,
my mother taught me how to whistle.

741

So, even when I'm afraid to speak,
I whistle.

742
00:43:29,333 --> 00:43:31,541
Because when you whistle,
it's your heart singing.

And that voice,

I forgot getting along
could be so much fun.

866
00:48:57,625 --> 00:48:59,625
I forgot we had an oven in here.

867
00:48:59,708 --> 00:49:02,500
Well, when I was a little girl,
every day was like this.

868
00:49:02,583 --> 00:49:03,791
Every day?

869
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:05,166
Every day.

870
00:49:07,875 --> 00:49:09,416
When my father was king.

871
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,250
Oh.

872
00:49:12,041 --> 00:49:15,041
The Huntsman said
the queen lied about my father.

873
00:49:15,125 --> 00:49:16,708
She lied about everything.

874
00:49:17,666 --> 00:49:19,250
What if he's still alive?

875
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,333
I have to find him.

876
00:49:24,041 --> 00:49:25,875
You said that there were bandits
in the forest

877
00:49:25,958 --> 00:49:27,375
who claimed to fight in the king's name.

878
00:49:27,458 --> 00:49:28,458
[Grumpy] Human criminals.

879
00:49:28,541 --> 00:49:30,375
Those rebels are nothing but thieves.

880
00:49:30,458 --> 00:49:32,333
They're actually
a band of erstwhile actors

881
00:49:32,416 --> 00:49:34,333
whose sustenance was made unstable

882
00:49:34,416 --> 00:49:36,500
by the queen's greedy economic policies

883
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:38,208
which forced them into a liminal space

884
00:49:38,291 --> 00:49:40,208
where ethics and motives are ill-defined.

885
00:49:41,333 --> 00:49:42,375
Well, where are they?

886
00:49:43,041 --> 00:49:45,583
If they know the truth about my father,
I need to find them.

887
00:49:45,666 --> 00:49:47,125
Oh, no. I advise against it.

888
00:49:47,208 --> 00:49:48,500
It's too dangerous.

889
00:49:48,583 --> 00:49:49,625
[Bashful] Stay with me.

890
00:49:51,208 --> 00:49:52,291
I mean, us.

891
00:49:52,375 --> 00:49:56,166
Yeah. You barely got away
from the queen the last time. [sneezes]

892
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:57,250
Gesundheit.

893
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:00,000
But this is what I have to do.

894
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:02,250
Besides, Grumpy's right.

895
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:05,333
The longer I stay here with you,
the more danger I put you in.

896
00:50:05,416 --> 00:50:07,000
At last.

897
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:09,500
- Goodbye.
- Grumpy!

898
00:50:09,583 --> 00:50:10,583
No.

899
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:12,875
It's time for me to stop hiding.

900
00:50:12,958 --> 00:50:15,208
Thank you all
for showing me such kindness.

901
00:50:15,291 --> 00:50:16,250
No, wait a minute.

902
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:17,583
Even you, Grumpy.

903
00:50:18,333 --> 00:50:19,625
Now,

904
00:50:19,708 --> 00:50:21,208
can you point me in the right direction?

905
00:50:22,291 --> 00:50:24,458
- [Sleepy snores]
- [Doc] We're late for work!

906
00:50:24,541 --> 00:50:25,625
Come on, everybody. I need you to...

907
00:50:25,708 --> 00:50:27,250
[Happy] I'll get the snacks.

908
00:50:27,333 --> 00:50:29,125
Come on, Sleepy. Hello?

909
00:50:29,208 --> 00:50:31,208

912
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:43,125
Don't say a word.

913
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:44,750
You.

914
00:51:45,583 --> 00:51:48,041
If we go this way,
we'll link up with the other riders.

915
00:51:48,875 --> 00:51:50,291
[soldier urges horse]

916
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,583
[horse whinnies]

917
00:51:52,666 --> 00:51:54,958
And when I told you
to come see what it was like out here,

918
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,250
didn't expect you to bring
half the palace guards with you.

919
00:51:57,333 --> 00:51:59,166
I didn't exactly invite them.

920
00:51:59,666 --> 00:52:01,083
I had no choice but to run.

921
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:03,208
The queen wants me dead.

922
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Come on.

923
00:52:09,416 --> 00:52:11,000
I'm actually looking for my father.

924
00:52:11,083 --> 00:52:13,083
I was hoping you might be able to help me.

925
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:15,541
You're loyal to the one true king.

926
00:52:17,916 --> 00:52:18,916
Right.

927
00:52:19,708 --> 00:52:21,166
Absolutely.

928
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:22,250
We, uh...

929
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
We hear rumors, whispers.

930
00:52:25,875 --> 00:52:29,166
Some people say he was taken prisoner
in the Southern Kingdom, but...

931
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:31,083
You have no idea where he is.

932
00:52:31,916 --> 00:52:33,250
I'm so sorry to disappoint.

933
00:52:34,125 --> 00:52:36,458
You must have mistaken me
for a knight in shining armor.

934
00:52:37,583 --> 00:52:39,750
I don't think anyone's
making that mistake.

935
00:52:40,333 --> 00:52:42,291
I was hoping you might know something.

936
00:52:42,375 --> 00:52:43,375
Oh, of course.

937
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,666
Princesses are always waiting for a prince
to show up or a king to come back.

938
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:51,083
My father is the only person who can
restore this kingdom to what it once was.

939
00:52:51,166 --> 00:52:53,000
A little late for that, I'm afraid.

940
00:52:53,083 --> 00:52:55,541
Obviously, you've forgotten
how things used to be,

941
00:52:55,625 --> 00:52:58,416
when people were kind and fair.

942

1037
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:26,375
I'm going to need your help.

1038
00:57:28,583 --> 00:57:30,875
[grunting]

1039
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:42,583
[grunting]

1040
00:57:53,708 --> 00:57:54,958
Last chance, bandits.

1041
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,625
Tell us what you know of Snow White.

1042
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:00,458
You seek Snow White?

1043
00:58:01,666 --> 00:58:02,916
I'm over here.

1044
00:58:05,166 --> 00:58:06,166
This way.

1045
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:10,208
- Go!
- [captain] Move!

1046
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,375
Spread out!

1047
00:58:31,291 --> 00:58:33,375
[chittering]

1048
00:58:35,166 --> 00:58:36,875
Spread out. Find them.

1049
00:58:36,958 --> 00:58:37,958
Yes, sir!

1050
00:58:41,208 --> 00:58:42,375
Where's my horse?

1051
00:58:42,875 --> 00:58:44,083
- [horse neighs]
- [Snow White urges horse]

1052
00:58:51,041 --> 00:58:52,041
Go, go.

1053
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,083
You came back.

1054
00:58:55,166 --> 00:58:57,583
Someone had to solve
your princess problem.

1055
00:58:57,666 --> 00:58:58,916
I told you I'd fight with you.

1056
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,333
- [sighs] I guess you meant it.
- I guess so.

1057
00:59:03,083 --> 00:59:04,375
You continue to impress me.

1058
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:06,000
Oh, thank you.

1059
00:59:06,083 --> 00:59:09,916
Compliment like that coming from
a criminal mastermind like yourself.

1060
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:14,833
Make sure we lost them.

1061
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:21,250
The people,

1062
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:23,416
they've forgotten how it used to be.

1063
00:59:24,291 --> 00:59:26,458
And they despise the queen.
But they're afraid.

1064
00:59:28,791 --> 00:59:30,333
That's why we fight in your father's name.

1065
00:59:33,291 --> 00:59:34,750
Your parents weren't afraid of anything.

1066
00:59:36,708 --> 00:59:38,416
They made us all feel a little braver.

1067
00:59:42,666 --> 00:59:43,875
They gave everyone hope.

1068
00:59:56,208 --> 00:59:58,250
[Jonathan] Now, we'll cut through
to the glen a mile south.

1069
00:59:58,333 --> 01:00:00,166
We need to cover our tracks.

1070
01:00:09,208 --> 01:00:11,375
[crossbow creaking]

1071
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:13,291
[grunts]

1072
01:00:13,375 --> 01:00:14,208
[metal clangs]

1073
01:00:15,375 --> 01:00:17,250
- Jonathan?
- [thief's associate 3] What was that?

1074
01:00:17,333 --> 01:00:18,625
- [Jonathan panting]
- [thief's associate 2] Oh, no.

1075
01:00:18,708 --> 01:00:21,041
I think we have a bit of a problem,
Princess.

1076
01:00:21,416 --> 01:00:22,833
[associate 2] He's going to need a doctor.

1077
01:00:23,541 --> 01:00:26,666
Doc is more of a sobriquet
rather than a technical title

1078
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:28,458
as my true expertise lies

1079
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:31,708
in the study of igneous, sedimentary,
and metamorphic granules.

1080
01:00:32,208 --> 01:00:34,375
You know, rocks.

1081
01:00:34,458 --> 01:00:35,750
- [groans]
- Oh!

1082
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:38,625
I am the rebel Quigg,

1083
01:00:38,708 --> 01:00:40,416
master of the crossbow,

1084
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,000
and I'm ordering you to save him.

1085
01:00:42,083 --> 01:00:44,791
- Oh, we haven't even been introduced yet.
- [groaning]

1086
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:46,750
- In alphabetical order...
- Doc, please, we don't have time.

1087
01:00:46,833 --> 01:00:48,250
He's badly injured. You have to help.

1088
01:00:48,333 --> 01:00:49,750
But they're bandits!

1089
01:00:49,833 --> 01:00:51,708
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Come here, you.

1090
01:00:51,791 --> 01:00:54,041
- [angry chatter]
- [Snow White whistles]

1091
01:00:54,666 --> 01:00:56,916
This is exactly how the queen
would want us to behave.

1092
01:00:57,416 --> 01:00:58,541
Fighting with each other,

1093
01:00:59,291 --> 01:01:02,166
distrusting each other.
This is how she wins!

1094
01:01:02,916 --> 01:01:06,291
She's poisoned everyone into believing
that it's everyone for themselves.

1095
01:01:08,708 --> 01:01:10,708
But if...

1096
01:01:11,666 --> 01:01:13,833
we can give up our meager scraps,

1097
01:01:14,875 --> 01:01:17,541
we will inherit
what was meant for all of us.

1098
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:21,708
And it's more than any of us can imagine.

1099
01:01:22,875 --> 01:01:23,875
It just...

1100
01:01:25,083 --> 01:01:27,625
requires faith in each other.

1101
01:01:28,166 --> 01:01:29,166
[Sneezy] Mmm.

1102
01:01:31,166 --> 01:01:32,375
Now help him.

1103
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:35,666
Please.

1104
01:01:37,833 --> 01:01:38,666
Hmm.

1105
01:01:42,208 --> 01:01:43,375
Bring him inside.

1106
01:01:46,208 --> 01:01:47,208
Hot milk.

1107
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:50,666
It helps me sleep.

1108
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:51,750
Thank you.

1109
01:01:59,166 --> 01:02:02,083
I used the blast furnace
to cut through the bedrock,

1110
01:02:02,166 --> 01:02:04,083
then drilled to the fissure core,

1111
01:02:04,166 --> 01:02:06,083
added a poultice or two.

1112
01:02:06,166 --> 01:02:08,500
A dose of acetum saturninum,

1113
01:02:08,583 --> 01:02:10,833
acid of sulfur dulcified.

1114
01:02:10,916 --> 01:02:13,666
[sighs] Uh...

1115
01:02:19,291 --> 01:02:20,708
- [snoring]
- [gasps]

1116
01:02:20,791 --> 01:02:22,166
- Oh, oh!
- That was...

1117
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:23,125
Huh.

1118
01:02:25,083 --> 01:02:26,666
- ...unpleasant.
- [Happy] You did it, Doc.

1119
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:27,750
I thought he was dead.

1120
01:02:27,833 --> 01:02:28,875
[chuckles]

1121
01:02:28,958 --> 01:02:30,083
[cheers, laughter]

1122
01:02:31,458 --> 01:02:33,958
- Hey.
- [chuckles]

1123
01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:35,625
[laughter and chatter]

1124
01:02:36,875 --> 01:02:38,666
[all chuckling]

1125
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:40,708
- Thank you, Doc.
- Of course.

1126
01:02:40,791 --> 01:02:44,125
I would do anything
for Snow White's special friend.

1127
01:02:44,208 --> 01:02:46,333
- [Happy] Ooh! You got a special friend.
- Oh, no.

1128
01:02:46,416 --> 01:02:48,125
- [chuckles] No.
- Oh.

1129
01:02:48,208 --> 01:02:49,291
- [Snow White] No. No.
- What?

1130
01:02:49,375 --> 01:02:51,458
- I would have brought anyone here to...
- [Jonathan] Exactly.

1131
01:02:51,541 --> 01:02:52,833
Run-of-the-mill kindness.

1132
01:02:52,916 --> 01:02:56,000
It's nothing to do with you.

1133
01:02:57,625 --> 01:03:00,416
- [Sneezy] Awkward.
- Oh, isn't this just wonderful?

1134
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:02,208
You know what time it is, fellas?

1135
01:03:02,291 --> 01:03:04,791
- Please, no.
- What time is it?

1136
01:03:04,875 --> 01:03:06,750
It's time to dance.

1137
01:03:06,833 --> 01:03:08,166
[Happy] Yeah!

1138
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:10,333
- [chuckles]
- Ah, achoo!

1139
01:03:10,416 --> 01:03:13,416
[cheering, laughter]

1140
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:15,041
Yeah! Woo-hoo!

1141
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:16,666
- [all] Hey, hey!
- [Happy exclaiming]

1142
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:18,208
Hey, hey, hey!

1143
01:03:18,291 --> 01:03:20,708
[cheering, yodeling]

1144
01:03:25,208 --> 01:03:27,083

1145
01:03:29,166 --> 01:03:30,291
[yodels]

1146
01:03:30,375 --> 01:03:31,666
Hey!

1147
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:33,125
- [laughter]
- [groans]

1148
01:03:33,208 --> 01:03:34,625
[cheerful chatter]

1149
01:03:36,791 --> 01:03:38,125
You want to play cards?

1150
01:03:38,208 --> 01:03:39,208
No, thank you.

1151
01:03:39,291 --> 01:03:40,291
What about you? Do you wanna play?

1152
01:03:41,416 --> 01:03:43,583
You and Maple are fine dancers.

1153
01:03:43,666 --> 01:03:44,791
Ah. [chuckles]

1154
01:03:44,875 --> 01:03:46,375
We're just friends.

1155
01:03:46,458 --> 01:03:47,541
Right.

1156
01:03:47,625 --> 01:03:48,666
You know, like you and Jonathan.

1157
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:53,750
I'm pretty sure
Jonathan only cares about himself.

1158
01:03:55,583 --> 01:03:57,000
Is that why he took an arrow for ya?

1159
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:58,708
What?

1160
01:03:58,791 --> 01:04:00,125
We all saw it.

1161
01:04:00,791 --> 01:04:02,541
That selfish, no-good thief?

1162
01:04:04,458 --> 01:04:06,083
