[shouting stops]

5
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,196
[girl] This is a true story.

6
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:33,158
It happened right here
in my town two years ago.

7
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:37,037
A lot of people die
in a lot of really weird ways

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,413
in this story,

9
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:39,957
but you're not gonna find it
in the news

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,625
or anywhere like that

11
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,837
because the police and
the top people in this town

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,213
were, like, so embarrassed

13
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,881
that they weren't able
to solve it

14
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:49,925
that they covered everything
all up.

15
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,512
But if you come here
and ask anyone,

16
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:54,847
they'll all tell you
the same thing

17
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,890
that I'm gonna tell you now.

18
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,519
This story starts
in my school.

19
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,355
Maybrook Elementary

20
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,649
is kindergarten
through fifth grade.

21
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,152
So this one Wednesday

22
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,864
is like a normal day
for the whole school.

23
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:15,617
And they had this teacher
who was new.

24
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:19,121
Her name was Justine Gandy.

25
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,958
And on this day,
she was going to her classroom

26
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,543
just like every morning.

27
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,713
But today was different.

28
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:31,258
Today, none of her kids
were there.

29
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:35,971
Every other class at that
school had all their kids.

30
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:39,474
Even the other third grade
Mrs. Belt taught was full.

31
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:43,937
But Mrs. Gandy's room
was totally empty.

32
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:48,275
Well, not totally.

33
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,153
There was one boy there.

34
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:54,156
And his name was Alex Lilly.

35
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:58,035
And he was the only kid
in the class of 18

36
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,953
that came to school that day.

37
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:02,539
And do you know why?

38
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:05,375
He was the only one there

39
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,880
because the night before
at 2:17 in the morning,

40
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:13,091
every other kid woke up,

41
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,510
got out of bed,

42
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:17,846
walked downstairs,

43
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,099
opened the front door,

44
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:24,520
walked across the front yard
and into the dark.

45
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,941
And they never came back.

[girl] All the parents
and people at the school

62
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,254
were really sad and upset.

63
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,716
The police could tell
that the kids left at 2:17

64
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,428
because, like, half the houses
had alarms

65
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:23,764
that got tripped
when they walked outside.

66
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,520
Some of the kids
even got videoed

67
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,104
by the houses
that had cameras.

68
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:34,483
But the cameras
only showed the kids

69
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,443
walking out into the darkness.

70
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,656
They didn't show
where they went after that.

71
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:45,494
The police talked
to Alex a lot.

72
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:50,332
They asked him why his
classmates did what they did,

73
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,209
but he told them
he didn't know.

74
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,212
They asked him
if there was a plan,

75
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,506
but he said if there was,
he never heard it.

76
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,634
They asked him
if there was a TV show

77
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,427
where someone ran away
like that,

78
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,889
but he said if there was,
he never saw it.

79
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,394
They also talked to Mrs. Gandy
a whole bunch,

80
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,104
but she also
didn't know anything

81
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:13,355
and couldn't help them.

82
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,358
For almost a whole month,

83
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:19,319
they kept the school closed
for their big investigation.

84
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,032
But after a while, they had to
open everything back up,

85
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:27,327
so that the kids that didn't
disappear could learn again.

86
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:30,914
One night before they did,

87
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:33,166
they had a big meeting
at the school.

88
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,294
There was a bunch
of counselors

89
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:36,712
and people like that

90
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:39,256
to help everybody figure out
how to feel

91
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,592
and be sad together, I guess.

92
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:46,597
This is where the story
really starts.

93
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:55,439
[man] What's important is
that we don't judge our grief.

94
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,983
We might experience emotions
we don't like.

95
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,027
Emotions besides sadness.

96
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:03,071
We need to make sure
that we allow ourselves

97
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:05,157
to feel emotions like anger.

98
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:10,037
Anger is a very healthy part
of the grief cycle.

99
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:13,498
It can be especially powerful
in instances of abandonment.

100
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,250
Now, there are often times
that we...

101
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:16,793
[parent 1]
What does that mean?

102
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:20,005
"Especially powerful
in instances of abandonment"?

103
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,216
Are you saying that we should
be upset with Matthew?

104
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:23,592
I'm saying it wouldn't
be abnormal...

105
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:24,801
[parent 1]
I'll tell you right now

106
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,553
that you may call
what happened "abandonment,"

107
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:28,472
but I don't.
I don't see it like that.

108
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:32,059
I see something that doesn't
make any sense at all.

109
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:36,438
We're talking about 17 kids
in one classroom.

110
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:38,273
What happened
in that classroom?

111
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:41,026
Why just her classroom?
Why only hers?

Anything the user does,
ZipString follows.

181
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:38,680
The string flies
at around 35 miles per hour,

182
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:40,182
and yet is safe to the touch.

183
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:44,603
All right, Sharks, watch this
trick. It's called the swirl.

184
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:48,357
This one's the corkscrew.

185
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,108
This one's the step-through.

[doorbell rings]

187
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:53,946
And pop!

188
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:56,865

190
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,457
Hello?

191
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:21,515
Hello?

192
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,060
Yes?

-Jesus! Fucking what?
-[pounding stops]

198
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:58,468
Who's there?

199
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:01,763
Hello?

200
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:10,564
Fuck!

[principal] You're gonna keep
your health insurance,

204
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:44,264
and if you don't
mind me saying,

205
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,768
there's a lot of mental health
specialists on the plan.

206
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:48,810
Some of them are...

207
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:51,855
I, uh...
I just need to work, you know?

208
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:54,525
I just need to fill my days
with, uh...

209
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:58,278
Yeah, I... I need to work.
So... [chuckles]

210
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:01,448
Justine, the scene last night
was just proof

211
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:04,076
that we have a lot
of emotional parents here.

212
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:05,786
For now, I think it's best

213
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:08,205
if you keep some distance
from this place

214
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,124
until folks find time
to sort themselves out.

215
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,918
[child screeching]

216
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:15,003
How's Alex? Is he...

217
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:16,421
Alex is doing well.

218
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:19,383
He's in Mrs. Belt's class,
and we've been advised

219
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:20,884
that the best thing
that we can do for him

220
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:23,303
is keep him on a routine.
[inhales]

221
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:25,305
Keep his life as normal
as possible.

222
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:26,974
I would like to speak
with him.

223
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:28,642
We've had this
conversation before.

224
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,185
That's out of the question.

225
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:32,062
Well, I would...
I would feel so much better

226
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,480
if I could just
speak with him.

227
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:34,940
-Right there.
-What?

228
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,442
That's the problem.
You'd feel so much better.

229
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:39,611
He's been scrutinized
by the press.

230
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:42,030
He's had investigators
ransack his house.

231
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:43,782
He's been traumatized.

232
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:46,034
Let's try and put Alex
first, yes?

233
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:48,537
If you're implying
that I don't care

234
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,955
about Alex, or the students...

235
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,332
The issue isn't you caring
or not caring.

236
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,626
The issue here is,
you have a pattern

237
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,628
in which you overstep
professional lines

238
00:13:56,712 --> 00:13:58,380
-with the students.
-Oh, my God. Here we go.

239
00:13:58,463 --> 00:13:59,464
You know, I do not overstep.

240
00:13:59,548 --> 00:14:01,884
You know it's not appropriate
to hug students.

241
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:04,845
Oh, I hugged a crying
little boy. Lock me up.

242
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:07,890
You know driving students home
is not professional.

243
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:09,808
What? She missed the bus.
She lived close to me.

244
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:11,185
-It's not appropriate.
-What...

245
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:13,896
[sighs] I know all of this

246
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:15,689
comes from the fact
that you care.

247
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:18,734
I know that you aren't
a threat to these kids,

248
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:20,235
but you have to realize,

249
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:22,905
you aren't a parent,
you're a teacher.

250
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:24,031
There's a difference.

251
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:27,492
And for that reason, no,
you cannot talk to Alex Lilly.

252
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:32,706
It's just...

253
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,210
We're the only ones left.

255
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,469
-No way.
-Look, look, look.

[whimpers]

258
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,368
Yeah, it's really
on there, huh?

259
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:12,871
Yeah, I've been
receiving phone calls as well.

260
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:14,331
-Threatening ones.
-Oh, yeah?

261
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,917
Think the caller might be
responsible for this?

262
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:19,962
I-I don't know.
Maybe, maybe not.

263
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:20,879
Yeah, well...

264
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,715
Whoever it was, the best
we can do is file a report.

265
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:26,218
Probably kids did this,
if you ask me.

266
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,594
I mean... [chuckles]

267
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:28,887
...hell, I used to do
stuff like this

268
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:30,305
when I was in school.

269
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:33,141
You know, TP houses,
ding-dong ditch.

270
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:34,768
I never wrote "witch"
on a car before,

271
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:37,521
but a buddy of mine
smeared some of his own...

["The Dark End of the Street"

273
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,121
Hey!

274
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:55,622
[both laugh]

275
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:56,915
Can we hug?

276
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,459
Yeah, of course we can hug.
Jesus.

277
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:10,512
What happened
to your hand there?

278
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:13,682
Oh, it was just a stupid
work accident thing.

279
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:14,766
-Nothing.
-Drink?

280
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:17,728
-Sure.
-Uh, Tony?

281
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:19,813
Tony?

282
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:21,690
Yeah, he'll...
he'll be here in a sec.

283
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:23,192
-That's fine.
-So...

284
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:24,484
-Yeah.
-I'm not in a rush.

285
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,612
-[chuckles]
-Um...

286
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:30,616
Wow. So I...
I didn't expect you to come.

287
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:34,494
I'm glad you texted. I...

288
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:37,414
You know, I've been thinking
about you a lot, and, uh...

289
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:38,582
I wanted to call,

290
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:42,044
but I didn't know if that
would make things worse or...

291
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:43,420
-I don't know what's...
-Yeah, well,

I'm not some
little delicate flower

that would wilt if I saw your
name pop up on my phone.

294
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:49,885
-I know. I'm not saying...
-So, yeah.

295
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:52,888
Uh, Tony.
Uh, my friend wants a drink.

00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:54,139
Hi. Hi.

-Uh, yeah. Go ahead.
-[Tony] How we doing?

Hi. Um, I'll get a Coke.

-A Coke?
-Yep.

00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,319
Okay, fine. Whatever.
[chuckles]

301
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:10,739
So, what's going on?
How are you?

302
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:13,534
Well, everybody thinks
I'm a witch.

303
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,203
I don't think that's true.

304
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:17,746
Go look at my car.

305
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:20,040
Pfft.
I hope you didn't drive here.

306
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:22,416
Why do you hope
that I didn't...

307
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:24,044
I hope you didn't drive here
because...

308
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:24,962
Wait...

309
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,048
Don't be an asshole, Paul.

-I'm not being an asshole.
-Come on.

311
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:30,217
I'm not being an asshole.

312
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,010
I'm concerned
about you, and...

313
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:33,178
You know what? I don't need...

314
00:17:33,262 --> 00:17:35,848
I don't need
your fucking concern.

315
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:37,599
Okay? I'm not drunk.

316
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:39,434
Okay. Got it. I'm sorry.

317
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:47,776
So what,
somebody vandalized your car?

318
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,153
They wrote "witch" across it.
So, yes.

319
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:52,823
For your information,
everybody thinks you're...

320
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:55,117
I'm a witch.

321
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,201
So, yes.

322
00:17:56,285 --> 00:17:57,786
-One Coke.
-Thank you.

323
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,503
Can I give you a little, uh...

324
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:08,964
-Tough love?
-No.

325
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:10,424
Just some thoughts
from somebody

326
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:11,842
who knows you very well.

327
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:16,138
-Is that okay?
-Yep.

328
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,766
Try to get out
of your own head.

329
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:24,229
People are not all thinking
about you right now, okay?

330
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:26,315
The whole town
isn't aimed at you.

331
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:28,984
Hmm. I think you might
actually be wrong about that.

332
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:32,654
You have a tendency
to get a little "woe is me"...

333
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:35,991
-Wow. Wow. Okay.
-...and a little paranoid.

334
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:38,535
And one thing I know
has never helped is this.

335
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,788
What is "this"? What?

336
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,001
A lonely drinking pity party.

337
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,089
I'm not lonely.

338
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:54,468
You're here.

339
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:01,808
You know what I mean, okay?
And I can't stay.

340
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:04,228
Does Donna know you're here?

341
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:06,271
No.

342
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:07,981
-Really?
-Really.

343
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:11,401
We're not... You know,
we're not happening right now.

344
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:14,196
Wow.

345
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,699
It's not a big deal.

346
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:18,825
Mm-hmm.

347
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:23,163
You're ridiculous.

348
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:25,999
Look at you. You're beaming.

349
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:30,087
Come on.
Have one real drink with me.

350
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,339
-Justine, no. Justine.
-Come on. Please.

351
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:34,466
Please?

352
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,803

00:35:01,685 --> 00:35:03,896
With a member of the faculty.

530
00:35:03,979 --> 00:35:06,148
She's a troubled person,
is she not?

531
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:10,027
What is it you think
that she knows?

532
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:13,655
What do you think it is
that she's not telling us?

533
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:15,407
Because those kids walked out
of those homes.

534
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:16,700
No one pulled them out.

535
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:19,286
No one forced them.

536
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:20,954
I don't see
anything whatsoever

537
00:35:21,038 --> 00:35:22,623
that points to that woman.

538
00:35:25,459 --> 00:35:27,044
What do you see that I don't?

539
00:35:27,836 --> 00:35:30,547
I see something that
I don't understand at all.

540
00:35:30,631 --> 00:35:31,632
[parent 1] Yeah!

541
00:35:31,715 --> 00:35:35,636
We're talking about 17 kids
in one classroom.

542
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:37,095
And none of them
talked about it?

543
00:35:37,179 --> 00:35:38,055
[parent 2] Exactly.

544
00:35:38,138 --> 00:35:39,556
And we got how many parents
in here,

545
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,225
and none of us saw it coming?

546
00:35:41,308 --> 00:35:42,768
[parents shouting]

547
00:35:42,851 --> 00:35:45,562
I want to know what happened
in that classroom.

548
00:35:45,646 --> 00:35:48,190
Why just her classroom?
Why only hers?

549
00:35:48,273 --> 00:35:50,442
[overlapping voices]

550
00:35:50,526 --> 00:35:51,818
[parent 3]
Where are our children?

551
00:35:51,902 --> 00:35:52,986
[parent 4]
You're just gonna leave?

552
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:53,904
[Marcus] That's enough.

553
00:35:53,987 --> 00:35:55,197
Everybody needs to give us
some space.

554
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,698
-Please. Please.
-[shouting continuing]

555
00:35:57,241 --> 00:35:59,243
Let's all get
a good night's sleep.

556
00:35:59,326 --> 00:36:00,911
Wake up with clearer heads.
Please.

557
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:04,373
-[parent 5] She has answers!
-[parents shouting]

558
00:36:09,962 --> 00:36:11,505
Excuse me, miss, I'm saving up
for a bus ticket

559
00:36:11,588 --> 00:36:13,090
to see my brother. Do you have
any change on you at all?

560
00:36:13,173 --> 00:36:14,216
[Justine] Sorry.

561
00:36:47,082 --> 00:36:48,083
[gasps]

562
00:37:19,323 --> 00:37:20,324
Matthew?

563
00:37:35,297 --> 00:37:36,298
Matthew.

564
00:37:38,383 --> 00:37:39,426
[hinge squeaks]

565
00:37:41,845 --> 00:37:43,055
[panting]

566
00:37:49,102 --> 00:37:50,229
Matthew!

567
00:37:53,357 --> 00:37:54,358
Stop!

568
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,381
Wait.

569
00:38:30,853 --> 00:38:32,271
[thunder rumbles]

570
00:38:57,629 --> 00:38:59,756
[footsteps running up stairs]

571
00:39:28,076 --> 00:39:29,077
Matthew?

572
00:40:07,449 --> 00:40:08,450
Matthew?

573
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:12,079
[gasps]

574
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:18,252
Matthew, where are you?

575
00:40:22,381 --> 00:40:23,799
Where did you go?

576
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:29,680
Talk to me.

577
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:32,599
Talk to me!

578
00:40:39,189 --> 00:40:40,524
[sniffs, groans]

579
00:40:41,817 --> 00:40:42,860
I'm sorry.

580
00:40:44,361 --> 00:40:46,488
I'm sorry that
I wasn't able to sa...

581
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:48,949
That I wasn't able...

582
00:40:53,537 --> 00:40:55,789
I wanted to say it
so many times.

583
00:40:58,417 --> 00:41:00,169
I really do want to say it
all the time

584
00:41:00,252 --> 00:41:02,588
because I feel it
all the time.

585
00:41:08,468 --> 00:41:09,595
I love you so much.

586
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:11,722
[shouts]

587
00:41:11,805 --> 00:41:13,473
[grunting, panting]

588
00:41:19,813 --> 00:41:20,981
What the fuck?

589
00:41:51,595 --> 00:41:53,055
Where's our house?

590
00:41:54,097 --> 00:41:55,390
There.

591
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,442
Where's the tower? Tower,
tower, tower, tower, tower.

592
00:42:05,526 --> 00:42:06,860
Ah.

593
00:42:21,416 --> 00:42:22,417
Show me.

594
00:42:24,837 --> 00:42:25,838
Come on.

595
00:42:33,595 --> 00:42:34,805
[bell chiming]

596
00:42:42,479 --> 00:42:43,605
Hi.

597
00:42:43,689 --> 00:42:45,148
-Hello.
-How are you?

598
00:42:46,692 --> 00:42:47,860
I'm Archer Graff.
I'm Matthew's...

599
00:42:47,943 --> 00:42:49,319
Yeah, I know who you are. Hi.

600
00:42:49,403 --> 00:42:52,406
Oh, good. I know we haven't
spoken before directly.

601
00:42:53,073 --> 00:42:54,950
We've seen each other
at a lot of the same...

602
00:42:55,033 --> 00:42:57,578
-How are you, Archer?
-I'm good. I'm real good.

603
00:42:58,370 --> 00:42:59,663
I... You know.

604
00:42:59,746 --> 00:43:01,707
All things considered, just...

605
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,459
soldiering on.

606
00:43:05,377 --> 00:43:06,712
We have to, don't we?

607
00:43:07,212 --> 00:43:08,213
We do.

608
00:43:08,297 --> 00:43:11,300
Listen, I'm sorry to
surprise you at home like this

609
00:43:11,383 --> 00:43:12,801
in the...
in the middle of the day.

610
00:43:12,885 --> 00:43:14,761
But, um, I don't know
if you know,

611
00:43:14,845 --> 00:43:16,972
but we got some footage of
Matthew leaving the house

612
00:43:17,055 --> 00:43:18,891
on our Ring cam thing here,

613
00:43:19,725 --> 00:43:21,894
and I think you folks
had the same...

614
00:43:22,436 --> 00:43:23,979
same situation with Bailey?

615
00:43:24,688 --> 00:43:25,856
Yeah, that's right.

616
00:43:25,939 --> 00:43:28,066
All right. Well, I'm sure
you showed yours to the police

617
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:30,194
just like I did, but I-I...

618
00:43:31,236 --> 00:43:34,198
I wondered if you would mind
letting me take a look at it.

619
00:43:35,032 --> 00:43:36,158
I don't need a copy
or anything.

620
00:43:36,241 --> 00:43:37,618
I'm not comfortable with that.

621
00:43:42,956 --> 00:43:44,458
Okay. I understand.

622
00:44:06,897 --> 00:44:07,898
Gary?

623
00:44:08,899 --> 00:44:10,275
Archer Graff. How you doing?

624
00:44:10,943 --> 00:44:11,944
Fine.

625
00:44:12,653 --> 00:44:13,946
Matthew's dad.

626
00:44:14,947 --> 00:44:17,032
Yeah. [sighs] Of course.

627
00:44:18,116 --> 00:44:19,117
How's it going?

628
00:44:19,201 --> 00:44:21,954
Um, I have a strange question
I need to ask you.

629
00:44:26,667 --> 00:44:28,210
It's kinda hard to watch this.

630
00:44:28,293 --> 00:44:30,045
Okay, wait. Go back to where
she steps on the sidewalk.

631
00:44:30,128 --> 00:44:31,129
Okay.

632
00:44:31,213 --> 00:44:32,214
Uh...

633
00:44:33,006 --> 00:44:34,925
Okay. Right there.

634
00:44:36,426 --> 00:44:37,469
[Gary] What do you see?

635
00:44:39,096 --> 00:44:41,598
One, two, three, four...

636
00:44:41,682 --> 00:44:45,143
...five, six, seven.

637
00:44:59,366 --> 00:45:00,450
Sorry.

638
00:45:20,888 --> 00:45:22,556
Come on. What am I looking at?

639
00:45:57,382 --> 00:45:58,383
Hey.

640
00:45:59,176 --> 00:46:00,802
-I want to talk to you.
-Well, I...

641
00:46:00,886 --> 00:46:02,763
I don't think we have anything
to say to each other.

642
00:46:02,846 --> 00:46:03,889
I think you have a lot to say.

643
00:46:03,972 --> 00:46:05,974
You and every other person
in this city.

644
00:46:06,058 --> 00:46:08,310
Believe me,
the message is loud and clear.

645
00:46:08,393 --> 00:46:09,853
I'm the problem. Got it.

646
00:46:09,937 --> 00:46:11,063
You know what?
I think that's the first

647
00:46:11,146 --> 00:46:12,689
honest thing
I've heard you say.

648
00:46:12,773 --> 00:46:14,983
-You are the problem.
-You wanna get in my face?

649
00:46:15,067 --> 00:46:16,360
-You wanna threaten me?
-I'm not...

650
00:46:16,443 --> 00:46:17,569
Nobody's threatening you.

651
00:46:17,653 --> 00:46:19,404
You're barking up
the wrong tree. Okay?

652
00:46:19,488 --> 00:46:21,823
This whole victim persona
that you're taking on,

653
00:46:21,907 --> 00:46:23,534
it might have
the police fooled,

654
00:46:23,617 --> 00:46:24,952
it might have
the school fooled...

655
00:46:25,035 --> 00:46:26,453
[speech fades]

656
00:46:28,872 --> 00:46:30,749
-Stop thinking of yourself!
-Marcus?

657
00:46:30,832 --> 00:46:33,043
You and I are gonna
have a conversation right...

658
00:46:33,126 --> 00:46:34,711
-[Marcus grunting]
-[Justine straining]

659
00:46:36,797 --> 00:46:38,257
[Justine gasping]

660
00:46:39,424 --> 00:46:40,425
Hey!

661
00:46:40,509 --> 00:46:42,928
[Marcus babbling incoherently]

662
00:46:46,932 --> 00:46:49,393
-[Marcus snarling]
-[Justine shrieking]

663
00:46:56,984 --> 00:46:58,277
Just stay down.

664
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,320
[panting, growling]

665
00:47:01,446 --> 00:47:02,447
Hey!

666
00:47:05,242 --> 00:47:06,743
[growling]

667
00:47:09,997 --> 00:47:11,832
[snarling]

668
00:47:12,332 --> 00:47:13,333
[shouts, growls]

669
00:47:19,715 --> 00:47:20,883
[shrieking]

670
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:27,931
[Paul] Hotel's good, though?

671
00:47:28,015 --> 00:47:29,808
-[Donna] It's fine.
-Yeah.

672
00:47:29,892 --> 00:47:32,477
Not the Ritz, but I'm not
expecting them to go nuts.

673
00:47:32,561 --> 00:47:36,231
Yeah. Well, it's only
for six nights. Right?

674
00:47:36,315 --> 00:47:37,566
Three, actually.

675
00:47:37,649 --> 00:47:39,109
Apparently,
I don't have to be here

676
00:47:39,193 --> 00:47:40,360
for the big wrap-up shindig,

677
00:47:40,444 --> 00:47:42,070
so I get to leave on Thursday.

678
00:47:43,488 --> 00:47:45,824
-Isn't that great?
-Yeah. It's good.

679
00:47:45,908 --> 00:47:47,618
'Cause I'm supposed
to ovulate Friday,

680
00:47:47,701 --> 00:47:49,745
so we can hit the target
this month.

681
00:47:51,246 --> 00:47:53,832
Nice. Okay. Yeah. Good.

682
00:47:53,916 --> 00:47:55,542
I thought you'd like that.

683
00:47:55,626 --> 00:47:58,504
Oh, will you tell my dad
when you see him today

684
00:47:58,587 --> 00:47:59,796
that since I'll be back
for the weekend,

685
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:02,007
we can make their
anniversary lunch thing?

686
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:03,634
[sighs]
Yeah, I'll let him know.

687
00:48:03,717 --> 00:48:04,885
He'll be happy.

688
00:48:04,968 --> 00:48:06,678
You about to start your shift?

689
00:48:06,762 --> 00:48:07,804
Yep.

690
00:48:07,888 --> 00:48:09,473
You gonna hit
a meeting afterward?

691
00:48:10,432 --> 00:48:12,768
Um, I wasn't planning on it.

692
00:48:14,186 --> 00:48:15,437
Don't you think you should?

693
00:48:16,271 --> 00:48:17,231
[sighs]

694
00:48:17,314 --> 00:48:18,982
Uh, if I have time,
I'll hit one.

695
00:48:19,066 --> 00:48:20,817
Paul, especially when

696
00:48:20,901 --> 00:48:22,402
you're going to be
spending stretches alone,

697
00:48:22,486 --> 00:48:24,905
I think it's important that
you go to regular meetings.

698
00:48:24,988 --> 00:48:27,449
I'm not gonna drink, Donna.
I feel fine.

699
00:48:27,533 --> 00:48:30,661
If I don't feel fine,
then I'll hit a meeting. Okay?

700
00:48:31,286 --> 00:48:32,412
Okay, sweetie.

701
00:48:32,955 --> 00:48:35,082
Okay. I gotta get going now.

702
00:48:35,165 --> 00:48:37,000
Okay. Don't forget to tell
my dad about this weekend.

703
00:48:37,084 --> 00:48:38,001
Yep.

704
00:48:38,085 --> 00:48:39,670
-Love you.
-Love you.

705
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:43,173
Jesus Christ.

706
00:48:47,219 --> 00:48:48,220
Hey, Ed.

Uh, Donna's back Friday,

709
00:48:51,765 --> 00:48:54,393
so we're good to have lunch
with you guys on Sunday.

710
00:48:54,476 --> 00:48:55,602
Why's she coming back early?

711
00:48:55,686 --> 00:48:57,563
I guess they're
cutting her loose, so...

712
00:48:58,146 --> 00:49:00,858
she wanted me to let you know
that we're in.

713
00:49:02,067 --> 00:49:03,151
Okay. Sounds good.

714
00:49:04,027 --> 00:49:06,363

No. No, sir. No, no, no.

No, sir. I wasn't saying that.

00:59:24,022 --> 00:59:25,774
What do you mean?
Why you no want? This is good.

885
00:59:25,858 --> 00:59:26,859
These are good.
These are good.

886
00:59:26,942 --> 00:59:28,527
Look, this is worth,
like, 50 bucks.

887
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:29,611
No.

888
00:59:29,695 --> 00:59:30,612
Twenty.

889
00:59:31,113 --> 00:59:31,947
Ten.

890
00:59:33,115 --> 00:59:34,116
Five.

891
00:59:34,658 --> 00:59:35,951
Please, dude. Please.

892
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,632
Fuck.

893
00:59:52,176 --> 00:59:53,010
[single-tone siren]

894
00:59:53,093 --> 00:59:54,595
[Paul] Stop right there.
Police.

895
00:59:56,013 --> 00:59:57,514
[siren wailing]

896
01:00:00,767 --> 01:00:01,768
Fuck!

897
01:00:01,852 --> 01:00:03,061
[groans]

898
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,985
[Paul] Way I see it, I did you
wrong, you did me wrong.

899
01:00:10,068 --> 01:00:11,195
We're gonna call it a day.

900
01:00:12,029 --> 01:00:13,614
But if I see you
out here again...

901
01:00:15,782 --> 01:00:17,993
it's gonna be
a different story. Yeah?

902
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:21,788
Okay.
Consider yourself warned.

903
01:00:21,872 --> 01:00:22,873
Get the fuck up.

904
01:00:29,755 --> 01:00:31,048
[thunder rumbling]

905
01:01:14,675 --> 01:01:15,676
Fuck!

906
01:01:16,426 --> 01:01:17,886
The fuck off me, man.

907
01:02:00,762 --> 01:02:01,847
What the fuck?

908
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:03,098
[straining]

909
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:10,272
[clattering]

910
01:03:21,218 --> 01:03:22,219
Shit.

911
01:03:53,834 --> 01:03:54,835
Oh, shit.

912
01:03:56,503 --> 01:03:57,671
Oh, fuck, Willow.

913
01:04:02,176 --> 01:04:03,343
Jesus! Fuck!

914
01:04:05,888 --> 01:04:07,306
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Um...

915
01:04:12,644 --> 01:04:13,645
Hello?

916
01:04:18,525 --> 01:04:19,526
You good?

917
01:04:31,872 --> 01:04:33,624
[finger snaps]

918
01:04:49,556 --> 01:04:50,724
[thud]

919
01:04:53,894 --> 01:04:55,145
What the fuck?

920
01:04:56,563 --> 01:04:57,773
[rattling]

921
01:05:03,779 --> 01:05:05,614

[gurgling]

924
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,121
Sorry! Fuck! Sorry!

925
01:05:54,204 --> 01:05:55,163
Sorry!

926
01:05:55,664 --> 01:05:57,291
Fuck! [grunts]

927

[panting]

930
01:06:05,632 --> 01:06:06,633
Fuck.

931
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:12,556
Goddamn it. Piece of shit.

932
01:06:12,639 --> 01:06:13,765
[cutlery clinking]

933
01:06:20,564 --> 01:06:22,357
What the fuck? Jesus! Fuck!

934
01:06:24,776 --> 01:06:26,278
Fuck! Goddamn it.

935
01:06:27,654 --> 01:06:29,907
Fuck! Argh!
Please, please, please.

936
01:06:30,616 --> 01:06:31,617
Fuck!

[pawnbroker]
20, 40, 60, 80, 100.

938
01:06:59,937 --> 01:07:00,938
Hey.

939
01:07:10,614 --> 01:07:11,990
I'm calling about
the $50,000 reward

940
01:07:12,074 --> 01:07:13,450
for information
about the missing kids

941
01:07:13,534 --> 01:07:14,910
'cause I know where they are.

942
01:07:17,079 --> 01:07:19,081
I'm pretty sure all of 'em.
Looked like a bunch of 'em.

943
01:07:19,164 --> 01:07:20,874
They're all standing
in the basement of this house,

944
01:07:20,958 --> 01:07:22,584
just, like, standing there.
And, um...

945
01:07:22,668 --> 01:07:23,877
I don't know.
They're in the basement

946
01:07:23,961 --> 01:07:24,795
standing all still and shit.

947
01:07:24,878 --> 01:07:26,338
And there's, like, fucking
two wackos over there.

948
01:07:26,421 --> 01:07:28,048
And it's just, like,
fucked-up. [laughs]

949
01:07:28,131 --> 01:07:30,300
Um, but-- So how's this...
how's this gonna work, though?

950
01:07:30,384 --> 01:07:31,426
How do I get the money?

951
01:07:32,761 --> 01:07:35,013
No, I'm not... I'm...
I'm completely serious.

952
01:07:35,097 --> 01:07:36,932
I mean, I can show you.
Like, I'll show you.

953
01:07:37,015 --> 01:07:38,600
Um, but I just... I, uh...

954
01:07:38,684 --> 01:07:40,394
I really don't wanna come in,
'cause, like, someone...

955
01:07:40,477 --> 01:07:42,062
Could someone come meet me
somewhere with the cash?

956
01:07:42,145 --> 01:07:43,230
'Cause like... I just...

957
01:07:43,313 --> 01:07:45,107
I really don't like
police stations, you know?

958
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:47,484
They just kind of freak
me out. I'm, uh... I'm phobic.

959
01:07:53,907 --> 01:07:54,908
[Paul] Hey!

960
01:07:56,285 --> 01:07:58,328
What did I tell you?
What did I fucking...

961
01:08:12,718 --> 01:08:13,760
[James whoops]

962
01:08:13,844 --> 01:08:16,345
"What'd I tell you, huh?
What'd I tell you?

963
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:18,515
What'd I tell you?
I'm a big cop, and I..."

964
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:21,935
[gasps]

965
01:08:25,314 --> 01:08:27,149
[crickets chirping]

966
01:08:50,714 --> 01:08:52,006
[panting]

967
01:08:59,096 --> 01:09:00,682
You're okay. You're okay.

968
01:09:00,765 --> 01:09:02,684
That wasn't real. That wasn't
real. That wasn't real.

969
01:09:02,768 --> 01:09:04,019
-It's okay. You're okay.
-[twig snaps]

970
01:09:07,356 --> 01:09:08,774
[James panting]

971
01:09:28,877 --> 01:09:30,921
[James panting]

972
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:34,883
[Paul screams]

973
01:09:35,843 --> 01:09:36,844
[James] Fuck.

974
01:09:40,013 --> 01:09:41,682
Fucker! You stabbed me!

975
01:09:41,765 --> 01:09:43,517
No, no, no. I'm sorry.
Sorry. It was an accident.

976
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:44,935
It was an accident. I'm sorry.

977
01:09:45,018 --> 01:09:46,645
Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait.
Wait, wait.

978
01:09:46,728 --> 01:09:47,729
I know where those kids are.

979
01:09:47,813 --> 01:09:48,981
That's why I was coming
to the station.

980
01:09:49,064 --> 01:09:50,941
-You're fucking lying!
-No, no, no, I'm not. I'm not.

981
01:09:51,024 --> 01:09:53,068
I promise. I promise. I know
where they are. I promise.

982
01:09:53,151 --> 01:09:54,111
Where?

983
01:09:54,194 --> 01:09:55,153
[stammering]

984
01:09:55,237 --> 01:09:57,990
They're at-at-at a house,
not far, in the basement.

985
01:09:58,073 --> 01:10:00,033
What the fuck are you t...
What house?

986
01:10:00,659 --> 01:10:01,827
I... I can show you, man.

987
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:03,579
It's-it's really, really,
really close.

988
01:10:17,259 --> 01:10:18,844
Oh, fuck me.

989
01:10:21,054 --> 01:10:22,055
Do you have AIDS?

990
01:10:23,515 --> 01:10:24,516
Huh?

991
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,894
AIDS, asshole.
Do you have AIDS?

992
01:10:27,436 --> 01:10:28,729
Uh...

993
01:10:28,812 --> 01:10:30,314
Uh, I don't think so.

994
01:10:30,814 --> 01:10:32,274
Hepatitis? Shit like that?

995
01:10:33,066 --> 01:10:35,110
I mean, shit,
not that I know of.

996
01:10:45,579 --> 01:10:46,622
That one, the dark one.

997
01:10:46,705 --> 01:10:47,998
Right there
at the end of the block.

998
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:03,388
Um, excuse me, sir.

999
01:11:03,472 --> 01:11:05,349
Um, I don't want to be rude,
but, like,

1000
01:11:05,933 --> 01:11:07,476
how do I know you aren't
gonna try and, like,

1001
01:11:07,559 --> 01:11:09,311
take that reward for yourself?

1002
01:11:12,689 --> 01:11:13,690
Sir?

1003
01:11:15,859 --> 01:11:16,860
Sir?

1004
01:11:17,986 --> 01:11:18,987
Officer?

1005
01:11:20,614 --> 01:11:22,574
Oh, man.

1006
01:11:37,422 --> 01:11:38,966
[no audible dialogue]

1007
01:11:41,385 --> 01:11:42,553
[mouthing words]
What the fuck?

1008
01:11:52,771 --> 01:11:53,939
What the fuck?

1009
01:11:54,606 --> 01:11:55,607
[crickets chirping]

1010
01:11:55,691 --> 01:11:57,734
What the fuck? [groans]

1011
01:11:59,152 --> 01:12:02,406
Let me the fuck out of here.
Goddamn it.

1012
01:12:05,617 --> 01:12:07,661
Oh. Thank you.

1013
01:12:13,166 --> 01:12:14,334
[whispering] What the fuck?

1014
01:12:22,509 --> 01:12:25,304
Jesus Christ. What the fuck?
Hey, yo, you good?

1015
01:12:25,387 --> 01:12:26,471
-[Paul snarling]
-Jesus Christ, bro!

1016
01:12:26,555 --> 01:12:28,307
-Hey! Get off me, bro!
-[Paul growls]

1017
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:31,393
Get the fuck off me!
Get the fuck off me!

1018
01:12:31,476 --> 01:12:32,728
Hey! Fuck!

1019
01:12:32,811 --> 01:12:35,522
Help me! Help me!
Someone, please help me!

1020
01:12:40,694 --> 01:12:42,905
[Justine] I'm telling you,
Marcus. I've seen it myself.

1021
01:12:42,988 --> 01:12:45,657
There's something
very, very wrong

1022
01:12:45,741 --> 01:12:47,034
going on inside of that house.

1023
01:12:47,117 --> 01:12:48,118
If you don't believe me,

1024
01:12:48,202 --> 01:12:49,369
-go there yourself.
-Justine, stop.

1025
01:12:49,453 --> 01:12:50,829
Here's the bottom line.

1026
01:12:50,913 --> 01:12:52,331
Alex has been
traumatized enough

1027
01:12:52,414 --> 01:12:54,499
by the events
of the last two months,

1028
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:56,668
-as I'm sure you have.
-Marcus...

1029
01:12:56,752 --> 01:12:58,962
Which is why I'm gonna do
you the courtesy

1030
01:12:59,046 --> 01:13:01,006
of forgetting that this
phone call ever took place.

1031
01:13:01,089 --> 01:13:04,468
If a child's welfare
is questioned, by law...

1032
01:13:04,551 --> 01:13:05,636
-Justine.
-...you have to refer it

1033
01:13:05,719 --> 01:13:07,221
to CPS.

1034
01:13:07,304 --> 01:13:08,305
By law.

1035
01:13:08,388 --> 01:13:09,806
Are you really gonna
take it there?

1036
01:13:10,807 --> 01:13:12,392
Is this the corner
you're gonna put me in?

1037
01:13:12,476 --> 01:13:14,811
Just go make the house call,
Marcus. Just do that.

1038
01:13:14,895 --> 01:13:18,649
I'm not authorized
to just make house calls.

1039
01:13:18,732 --> 01:13:20,776
Well, you're a mandatory
reporter. You have to.

1040
01:13:21,485 --> 01:13:22,653
Okay, here's what I'll do.

1041
01:13:22,736 --> 01:13:25,697
I'll invite his parents to
come in, have a talk with me.

1042
01:13:25,781 --> 01:13:28,242
We'll have a face-to-face
at the school.

1043
01:13:28,325 --> 01:13:29,952
Is that acceptable to you?

1044
01:13:30,035 --> 01:13:32,538
Yes, thank you. I would
really appreciate that.

1045
01:13:32,621 --> 01:13:35,082
Okay, then. You're welcome.
Goodbye.

1046
01:13:37,543 --> 01:13:39,336
-[knocking at door]
-Yeah.

1047
01:13:42,172 --> 01:13:43,715
Your two o'clock is here.

1048
01:13:43,799 --> 01:13:44,925
That's fine.

1049
01:13:48,554 --> 01:13:51,348
Well, send them in, please,
Marge.

1050
01:13:53,976 --> 01:13:55,143
This way, ma'am.

1051
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:11,285
Principal Miller, I'm Gladys.

1052
01:14:12,369 --> 01:14:14,496
Yes. H-Hi. Hi.

1053
01:14:15,038 --> 01:14:16,039
Come on in.

1054
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:19,334
-Have a seat, please.
-Oh, thank you.

1055
01:14:25,174 --> 01:14:26,175
Thank you, Marge.

1056
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:32,806
Thank you for coming in. I...

1057
01:14:33,432 --> 01:14:36,143
I know you guys have had
a lot of attention lately.

1058
01:14:36,226 --> 01:14:38,770
Not all of it
could possibly be wanted.

1059
01:14:38,854 --> 01:14:41,148
I'm happy to come by.
It's fine.

1060
01:14:41,231 --> 01:14:42,941
Okay. Forgive me...

1061
01:14:43,025 --> 01:14:44,860
We have not met.
Is that right?

1062
01:14:45,569 --> 01:14:46,945
No, I don't think so.

1063
01:14:47,029 --> 01:14:48,572
-Okay... Phew.
-[Gladys laughs]

1064
01:14:48,655 --> 01:14:52,242
Because I was relatively
certain I'd remember.

1065
01:14:52,910 --> 01:14:55,287
I know I've met
Alex's father before.

1066
01:14:55,370 --> 01:14:56,914
I'm Alex's aunt,

1067
01:14:56,997 --> 01:14:58,498
and his mom's my baby sister.

1068
01:14:58,582 --> 01:15:01,835
Okay. So you're not
his legal guardian.

1069
01:15:01,919 --> 01:15:04,505
Well, no. That would be
his parents, of course.

1070
01:15:04,588 --> 01:15:06,840
Okay. Well, uh...

1071
01:15:06,924 --> 01:15:07,925
Forgive me, Gladys,

1072
01:15:08,008 --> 01:15:11,887
but unfortunately, I need
to speak with his parents.

1073
01:15:11,970 --> 01:15:13,347
[sighs]

1074
01:15:13,847 --> 01:15:15,849
Well, I hate to say it,

1075
01:15:15,933 --> 01:15:18,810
but his parents have been
feeling unwell as of late,

1076
01:15:18,894 --> 01:15:21,688
and I'm staying with them
to help take care of Alex.

1077
01:15:21,772 --> 01:15:23,565
Oh. S-Sounds serious.

1078
01:15:24,233 --> 01:15:26,401
Oh, no. No, it's not serious.
Nothing terminal.

1079
01:15:26,485 --> 01:15:28,028
It's just a touch
of consumption.

1080
01:15:28,111 --> 01:15:29,655
"A touch of consumption"?

1081
01:15:30,322 --> 01:15:31,156
Yeah.

1082
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:33,325
You know what?

1083
01:15:33,408 --> 01:15:34,493
I'm embarrassed to say

1084
01:15:34,576 --> 01:15:36,912
I guess I don't really know
what that means.

1085
01:15:37,412 --> 01:15:38,413
I thought it was something

1086
01:15:38,497 --> 01:15:40,249
settlers got
on the Oregon Trail.

1087
01:15:40,332 --> 01:15:41,917
[both laughing]

1088
01:15:42,668 --> 01:15:44,753
-What is it? Tuberculosis?
-You know what?

1089
01:15:44,837 --> 01:15:49,299
They are doing just fine,
but they need to stay home.

1090
01:15:50,926 --> 01:15:53,679
I had hoped to speak to them
in person because...

1091
01:15:53,762 --> 01:15:56,139
[inhales] ...this is awkward,

1092
01:15:56,682 --> 01:15:59,935
but a concerned individual has
lodged a welfare complaint.

1093
01:16:00,018 --> 01:16:01,937
And unfortunately,
I need to make contact

1094
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:04,231
with the child's
legal guardian.

1095
01:16:04,314 --> 01:16:06,608
It's something
that's not really negotiable.

1096
01:16:06,692 --> 01:16:09,444
I need to speak
with their parents in person.

1097
01:16:09,528 --> 01:16:10,946
Oh, dear.

1098
01:16:11,029 --> 01:16:13,782
I could come over to the house
if that would make it easier.

1099
01:16:14,575 --> 01:16:17,244
I'm just trying to avoid
involving CPS.

1100
01:16:17,327 --> 01:16:18,871
-But frankly...
-CPS?

1101
01:16:18,954 --> 01:16:21,081
...I'm not convinced
that anything is wrong.

1102
01:16:21,164 --> 01:16:22,749
Who made the complaint?

1103
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,544
I'm not at liberty to say.

1104
01:16:28,130 --> 01:16:30,048
Well, this is very upsetting.

1105
01:16:30,132 --> 01:16:33,468
[TV] It is now that
all free will has been lost.

1106
01:16:34,845 --> 01:16:36,722
The ant moves
under the direction

1107
01:16:36,805 --> 01:16:39,099
of a mind separate
from its own.

1108
01:16:41,268 --> 01:16:42,853
Here, the ant initiates
its death grip.

1109
01:16:42,936 --> 01:16:44,688
Yum, yum, yum.

1110
01:16:44,771 --> 01:16:45,814
There we go.

1111
01:16:48,442 --> 01:16:52,738
As the parasitic Cordyceps
continue to feed off its body.

1112
01:16:52,821 --> 01:16:54,281
That's disgusting.

1113
01:16:57,868 --> 01:16:59,870
Fungal fruiting occurs next.

1114
01:17:01,663 --> 01:17:03,207
-Large blooms...
-[doorbell rings]

1115
01:17:03,290 --> 01:17:04,374
...that serve
to spread more spores...

1116
01:17:04,458 --> 01:17:05,459
Who could that be?

1117
01:17:08,086 --> 01:17:11,131
...that will find more ants.

1118
01:17:11,757 --> 01:17:12,758
[man] Ew.

1119
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:18,388
[panting]

1120
01:17:18,472 --> 01:17:20,307
-Thank God you're home.
-[man] Who is it?

1121
01:17:21,141 --> 01:17:22,851
I'm so sorry to disturb you
on a Saturday.

1122
01:17:22,935 --> 01:17:24,853
Oh, will you please,
please forgive me?

1123
01:17:24,937 --> 01:17:26,230
We're just sitting down.

1124
01:17:26,313 --> 01:17:28,899
The bus didn't pick me up
where it was scheduled to.

1125
01:17:28,982 --> 01:17:30,901
And I had realized
far too late...

1126
01:17:30,984 --> 01:17:32,319
[inhales]

1127
01:17:32,402 --> 01:17:34,404
...that I was standing
on the wrong corner.

1128
01:17:34,488 --> 01:17:35,906
And by the time
I put that together,

1129
01:17:35,989 --> 01:17:38,575
oh, I'd missed it entirely.

1130
01:17:38,659 --> 01:17:42,454
So I had to walk all the way
across town to get here.

1131
01:17:42,538 --> 01:17:43,997
Well, I'm so sorry
to hear that...

1132
01:17:44,081 --> 01:17:46,083
I am sorry to tell you this,
sweetie,

1133
01:17:46,166 --> 01:17:48,669
but I am on the verge
of collapse.

1134
01:17:48,752 --> 01:17:49,586
Oh.

1135
01:17:51,755 --> 01:17:53,590
Could I please
have some water?

1136
01:17:54,925 --> 01:17:55,926
I'm afraid that's re...

1137
01:17:56,009 --> 01:17:58,220
Of course
you can have some water.

1138
01:17:58,303 --> 01:17:59,513
Oh, thank you so much.

1139
01:17:59,596 --> 01:18:00,973
I'm afraid
it's really not a...

1140
01:18:01,056 --> 01:18:02,850
My name's Gladys,
it's so nice to meet you.

1141
01:18:02,933 --> 01:18:03,934
Hi.

1142
01:18:04,643 --> 01:18:08,230
Oh! I absolutely love
this house.

1143
01:18:08,313 --> 01:18:11,149
Look, a giraffe
and a green Chinese la...

1144
01:18:11,233 --> 01:18:13,277
That's original in there.
I bet it is.

1145
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:15,571
[clapping]
Oh, I just love this kitchen.

1146
01:18:15,654 --> 01:18:19,157
Clean, white cabinets.
How I'm envious of that.

1147
01:18:19,241 --> 01:18:20,284
[laughs]

1148
01:18:20,993 --> 01:18:23,287
Now, listen.
I know that it's inconvenient,

1149
01:18:23,370 --> 01:18:25,080
but I really needed
to speak to you

1150
01:18:25,163 --> 01:18:27,082
about our conversation
yesterday.

1151
01:18:27,165 --> 01:18:28,750
[coughs] Oh.

1152
01:18:28,834 --> 01:18:29,710
[coughs]

1153
01:18:29,793 --> 01:18:31,295
Marcus, get her a glass.

1154
01:18:31,378 --> 01:18:33,046
A bowl, please.

1155
01:18:35,132 --> 01:18:36,133
A bowl?

1156
01:18:36,216 --> 01:18:38,719
Yes, a bowl.
It's a peculiarity of mine.

1157
01:18:38,802 --> 01:18:40,888
I don't even try
to rationalize it anymore.

1158
01:18:43,891 --> 01:18:46,768
A bowl of water. Okay.

1159
01:18:46,852 --> 01:18:47,936
Thank you.

1160
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:50,480
I-I wanted you to know that
I talked to Alex's father,

1161
01:18:50,564 --> 01:18:52,399
who's very ill, as I said.

1162
01:18:52,482 --> 01:18:54,651
But the good news is,
he's more than happy

1163
01:18:54,735 --> 01:18:57,154
to come in Monday,
sit down with you

1164
01:18:57,237 --> 01:18:58,530
and clear everything up.

1165
01:18:59,573 --> 01:19:02,492
I appreciate that,
but it really is unnecessary.

1166
01:19:02,576 --> 01:19:04,912
So there's no need to contact
the authorities, right?

1167
01:19:04,995 --> 01:19:05,829
That's, uh...

1168
01:19:06,538 --> 01:19:07,831
Sure, I guess not.

1169
01:19:07,915 --> 01:19:10,167
I mean, you haven't
contacted them yet, right?

1170
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:13,086
Gladys, I'm really gonna
have to insist that you, uh...

1171
01:19:15,422 --> 01:19:17,132
Is... Is that my ribbon?

1172
01:19:19,718 --> 01:19:21,929
You haven't
contacted them, right?

1173
01:19:22,971 --> 01:19:24,806
No, I haven't. What is this?

1174
01:19:27,392 --> 01:19:28,393
[man] Oh, my God!

1175
01:19:28,477 --> 01:19:30,896
Whoops! Look what I did.
Oh, my goodness.

1176
01:19:30,979 --> 01:19:32,523
Why did you do that?

1177
01:19:32,606 --> 01:19:34,733
Well, it was an accident,
of course.

1178
01:19:34,816 --> 01:19:36,944
Wow. That's really bleeding.

1179
01:19:37,027 --> 01:19:38,111
Terry, go get the alcohol

1180
01:19:38,195 --> 01:19:39,655
-and the first aid kit.
-Okay.

1181
01:19:39,738 --> 01:19:42,074
Oh, no, no, no.
That's nonsense.

1182
01:19:42,157 --> 01:19:44,660
Could you get me
a rag, sweetie?

1183
01:19:44,743 --> 01:19:46,203

I think she cut my hair!

I'm calling 911.

1187
01:19:56,171 --> 01:19:57,965
Marcus, I think
she cut my hair!

1188
01:19:58,048 --> 01:20:00,342
Marcus, what did she do?

Just think of the kids.

1232
01:23:49,154 --> 01:23:50,697
[snarling]

1233
01:23:53,909 --> 01:23:55,202
[Justine screaming]

1234
01:24:01,959 --> 01:24:03,043
What the fuck?

1235
01:24:03,794 --> 01:24:05,170
[groaning]

1236
01:24:09,883 --> 01:24:10,884
Motherfucker.

1237
01:24:21,812 --> 01:24:23,814
Come on, you piece of shit.

1238
01:24:29,111 --> 01:24:31,446
[muffled screaming]

1239
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:39,162
[screaming continuing]

1240
01:24:41,290 --> 01:24:42,583
[woman screaming]

1241
01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:49,590
[sound becomes clearer]

1242
01:24:49,673 --> 01:24:52,301
[woman continues screaming]

1243
01:24:54,261 --> 01:24:55,846
[low chattering]

1244
01:25:02,728 --> 01:25:04,438
[no audible dialogue]

1245
01:25:27,586 --> 01:25:28,587
Are you okay?

1246
01:25:29,713 --> 01:25:31,673
Yeah, I think so.

1247
01:25:32,466 --> 01:25:33,467
I'm just, uh...

1248
01:25:34,593 --> 01:25:35,594
scraped up.

1249
01:25:36,303 --> 01:25:37,304
You?

1250
01:25:39,348 --> 01:25:40,349
The same.

1251
01:25:41,850 --> 01:25:43,101
I-I wanna thank you.

1252
01:25:43,185 --> 01:25:45,020
-Ah...
-No, I do. So, thank you.

1253
01:25:47,439 --> 01:25:48,440
Sure.

1254
01:25:48,982 --> 01:25:50,442
I mean, what else could I do?

1255
01:25:53,195 --> 01:25:54,530
Guy was out of control.

1256
01:25:55,447 --> 01:25:58,659
The last time I talked to him,
he was fine.

1257
01:25:58,742 --> 01:26:00,202
I mean, he really was.

1258
01:26:00,702 --> 01:26:01,703
[stammers]

1259
01:26:02,329 --> 01:26:05,457
I've never seen anything
like that in my life.

1260
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:07,501
I have.

1261
01:26:08,335 --> 01:26:09,670
What are you talking about?

1262
01:26:11,046 --> 01:26:13,507
The way he was running,
I've seen that before.

1263
01:26:17,553 --> 01:26:18,804
Can I show you something?

1264
01:26:20,138 --> 01:26:23,016
Their little girl ran
the same way Matthew did.

1265
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:25,352
Same posture, same exact way.

1266
01:26:25,435 --> 01:26:28,188
Just like Marcus
ran after you today.

1267
01:26:28,272 --> 01:26:29,648
He was weaponized.

1268
01:26:29,731 --> 01:26:32,901
Like a heat-seeking missile
just locked onto you.

1269
01:26:33,694 --> 01:26:36,321
So, here. Look at this.
This is my house.

1270
01:26:36,405 --> 01:26:37,990
This is Bailey Kramer's house.

1271
01:26:38,073 --> 01:26:40,200
Now, if you assume they were
heading in a straight line

1272
01:26:40,284 --> 01:26:42,286
at just some target of theirs,

1273
01:26:42,369 --> 01:26:44,663
and you assume they both had
the same target,

1274
01:26:44,746 --> 01:26:47,332
those lines intersect
somewhere around here.

1275
01:26:47,416 --> 01:26:48,250
Oh, my God.

1276
01:26:48,333 --> 01:26:49,710
There must be something
about this area.

1277
01:26:49,793 --> 01:26:52,004
-Alex.
-Some-- What?

1278
01:26:52,713 --> 01:26:55,090
Alex Lilly lives
in this house.

1279
01:27:01,054 --> 01:27:04,224
Who else can think
of an example of a parasite?

1280
01:27:04,766 --> 01:27:05,767
Anyone?

1281
01:27:06,727 --> 01:27:08,478
-Lisa?
-A tapeworm.

1282
01:27:08,562 --> 01:27:10,772
A tapeworm! Very good!

1283
01:27:10,856 --> 01:27:12,441
That's a gross one, right?

1284
01:27:12,524 --> 01:27:16,069
It lives in your intestines
and it eats your food.

1285
01:27:16,153 --> 01:27:17,487
[children chattering]

1286
01:27:20,657 --> 01:27:21,867
Stop it.

1287
01:27:21,950 --> 01:27:22,951
"Stop it."

1288
01:27:24,369 --> 01:27:26,663
-"Stop it."
-[other children laughing]

1289
01:27:26,747 --> 01:27:27,789
"Stop it."

1290
01:27:29,041 --> 01:27:30,083
"Stop it."

1291
01:27:38,258 --> 01:27:40,177
[children chatter, shout]

1292
01:27:46,558 --> 01:27:47,726
[man] What's up, Axe Man?

1293
01:27:50,687 --> 01:27:53,023
Talk to me, Axe Man.
How was school today?

1294
01:27:53,941 --> 01:27:56,443
-Good.
-Good? Kiss any supermodels?

1295
01:27:56,527 --> 01:27:57,986
[chuckles] No.

1296
01:27:58,070 --> 01:27:59,738
No? All right.

1297
01:28:01,448 --> 01:28:03,492
Well,
tonight's the night, pal.

1298
01:28:04,076 --> 01:28:06,537
Your mom's aunt Gladys
is coming, remember?

1299
01:28:07,496 --> 01:28:10,499
[sighs] Why do we have to
have her live at our house?

1300
01:28:11,124 --> 01:28:13,126
'Cause it's like
we talked about.

1301
01:28:13,710 --> 01:28:17,673
She's sick, and she doesn't
have anywhere else to go.

1302
01:28:19,424 --> 01:28:21,426
But I don't even
know her, though.

1303
01:28:21,510 --> 01:28:24,096
Pfft. I hear you, bud.
I don't know her either.

1304
01:28:24,805 --> 01:28:27,683
To be honest, I'm not sure
your mom knows her that well.

1305
01:28:27,766 --> 01:28:31,144
But she's family.
Family's important.

1306
01:28:32,062 --> 01:28:33,605
We gotta help each other out.

1307
01:28:34,314 --> 01:28:35,899
Hey, found a kid.

1308
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:39,528
Hey. My men have returned.

1309
01:28:39,611 --> 01:28:40,612
-Hi.
-Hi.

1310
01:28:40,696 --> 01:28:42,781
Whoa. Hey. Good day at school?

1311
01:28:42,865 --> 01:28:44,449
-Yeah.
-Okay, good.

1312
01:28:44,533 --> 01:28:47,119
Uh, I would really like to
get this house cleaned up

1313
01:28:47,202 --> 01:28:48,745
before your aunt Gladys
gets here.

1314
01:28:48,829 --> 01:28:50,497
So do me a favor,
get your room cleaned up

1315
01:28:50,581 --> 01:28:52,124
before you start
your homework.

1316
01:28:52,207 --> 01:28:54,168
She's not coming in my room,
is she?

1317
01:28:54,918 --> 01:28:56,170
I'd really like a clean house.

1318
01:28:56,253 --> 01:28:58,463
That includes your room,
so let's go.

1319
01:28:59,423 --> 01:29:02,676
I know. It's horrible
cleaning up after yourself.

1320
01:29:12,978 --> 01:29:14,938
[car doors shutting]

1321
01:29:30,329 --> 01:29:31,538
[dad] All right?

1322
01:29:38,212 --> 01:29:40,130
[mom] Hi! Come in!

1323
01:29:40,214 --> 01:29:42,174
-[dad] Got the door?
-[mom] I got it.

1324
01:29:42,257 --> 01:29:44,092
[dad] One more step.

1325
01:29:55,771 --> 01:29:58,440
[dad] I'm just saying
she looks really bad.

1326
01:29:58,524 --> 01:29:59,775
I don't know if this
is the place for...

1327
01:29:59,858 --> 01:30:02,152
Yeah, well, it's either here
or out on the street, Stephen.

1328
01:30:02,236 --> 01:30:05,739
Well, you know, this ain't
a hospice place, hon.

1329
01:30:05,822 --> 01:30:06,865
I know that. I know.

1330
01:30:06,949 --> 01:30:08,825
We're not equipped for this
kind of thing. All right?

1331
01:30:08,909 --> 01:30:11,119
We hadn't seen this woman
in 15 years.

1332
01:30:11,203 --> 01:30:12,621
She didn't even show up
to our wedding...

1333
01:30:12,704 --> 01:30:13,997
Look, my mom
would do this for her,

1334
01:30:14,081 --> 01:30:16,375
so I'm gonna do this
for her, okay?

1335
01:30:16,458 --> 01:30:17,709
I could really
use your support.

1336
01:30:17,793 --> 01:30:19,002
If at any point
you feel like...

1337
01:30:19,545 --> 01:30:21,588
Alex, honey,
what are you doing?

1338
01:30:21,672 --> 01:30:22,714
I'm hungry.

1339
01:30:22,798 --> 01:30:24,383
Oh, you're hungry.
Okay. All right.

1340
01:30:24,466 --> 01:30:25,634
Well, go downstairs, eat up

1341
01:30:25,717 --> 01:30:28,345
and then go brush your teeth,
okay? It's almost 7:30.

1342
01:30:28,428 --> 01:30:31,056
And be quiet back there.
Your aunt Gladys is sleeping.

1343
01:30:56,665 --> 01:30:57,666
[door creaks]

1344
01:31:08,552 --> 01:31:10,012
[door creaking]

1345
01:31:21,315 --> 01:31:22,149
[gasps]

1346
01:31:24,484 --> 01:31:26,612
How long
is she gonna stay with us?

1347
01:31:29,072 --> 01:31:30,532
Hard to say, pal.

1348
01:31:31,617 --> 01:31:33,785
Doesn't look like
she's getting much better.

1349
01:31:35,078 --> 01:31:37,289
So she's gonna stay
with us forever?

1350
01:31:37,372 --> 01:31:38,624
No.

1351
01:31:38,707 --> 01:31:39,750
I...

1352
01:31:39,833 --> 01:31:41,960
I don't think she'll be here
longer than a month.

1353
01:31:47,883 --> 01:31:49,343
[children chattering]

1354
01:31:55,933 --> 01:31:57,851
-All righty, man.
-All righty.

1355
01:31:57,935 --> 01:31:59,102
I'll pick you up
at 2:00, okay?

1356
01:31:59,186 --> 01:32:00,854
-See ya.
-See ya.

1357
01:32:00,938 --> 01:32:02,606
-I love you.
-Love ya.

1358
01:32:06,568 --> 01:32:08,529
[Justine] That's time.
Pencils down.

1359
01:32:09,863 --> 01:32:11,114
Matthew!

1360
01:32:11,198 --> 01:32:12,449
What?
You said, "Pencils down."

1361
01:32:12,533 --> 01:32:14,159
Matthew, outside now.

1362
01:32:14,243 --> 01:32:15,452
Alex, are you okay?

1363
01:32:15,536 --> 01:32:16,912
I'm fine.

1364
01:32:16,995 --> 01:32:19,206
Matthew, let's go.
Get your bag.

1365
01:32:19,957 --> 01:32:22,209
It was a joke. Oh, my God!

1366
01:32:23,335 --> 01:32:24,962
-[bell ringing]
-[students chattering]

1367
01:32:43,605 --> 01:32:45,732
-You miss your ride, son?
-I'm okay.

1368
01:32:45,816 --> 01:32:46,817
You sure?

1369
01:33:36,033 --> 01:33:40,746
Mom, Dad, where were you?

1370
01:33:41,830 --> 01:33:44,917
Hey, Axe Man. How was school?

1371
01:33:46,251 --> 01:33:47,252
What's wrong?

1372
01:33:48,003 --> 01:33:49,171
Alex?

1373
01:33:49,963 --> 01:33:52,090
Oh, welcome home.

1374
01:33:52,174 --> 01:33:53,050
[chuckles]

1375
01:33:53,133 --> 01:33:54,676
How are you, sweetie?

1376
01:33:57,179 --> 01:33:58,597
Let me take a look at you.

1377
01:33:58,680 --> 01:33:59,681
Oh, you know,
I haven't seen you

1378
01:33:59,765 --> 01:34:01,808
since you were
a little teeny baby.

1379
01:34:01,892 --> 01:34:03,227
What's wrong with my parents?

1380
01:34:03,310 --> 01:34:05,854
Oh, nothing, sweetheart.
They're just fine.

1381
01:34:05,938 --> 01:34:07,189
Mom.

1382
01:34:09,024 --> 01:34:11,985
Hey. How was school?

1383
01:34:12,069 --> 01:34:14,863
You see? I told you,
she's just fine. Don't worry.

1384
01:34:17,115 --> 01:34:18,116
Alex.

1385
01:34:19,201 --> 01:34:20,494
Now, don't be rude.

1386
01:34:21,745 --> 01:34:23,163
Why don't you sit down
at the table?

1387
01:34:23,247 --> 01:34:24,831
'Cause I'm making dinner.
I should have asked you,

1388
01:34:24,915 --> 01:34:25,999
but you weren't here,

1389
01:34:26,083 --> 01:34:27,793
so I thought mac and cheese
would...

1390
01:34:28,585 --> 01:34:29,753
Dad!

1391
01:34:29,837 --> 01:34:32,005
Alex, that's it.

1392
01:34:32,089 --> 01:34:34,258
I want you to go upstairs,
wash your face,

1393
01:34:34,341 --> 01:34:35,926
brush your teeth,
and then it is bedtime.

1394
01:34:36,009 --> 01:34:37,052
No dinner for you.

1395
01:34:40,430 --> 01:34:41,974
I'm not kidding, young man.
Go.

1396
01:35:19,178 --> 01:35:20,679
Come. Sit.

1397
01:35:30,856 --> 01:35:31,857
Alex.

1398
01:35:32,524 --> 01:35:33,567
Sit.

1399
01:35:39,364 --> 01:35:41,033
Don't worry about
your parents.

1400
01:35:41,116 --> 01:35:42,409
They're just resting.

1401
01:35:46,663 --> 01:35:50,000
Now, before you go to school
today, I want you to promise

1402
01:35:50,083 --> 01:35:53,212
that you will not tell
a living soul that I am here

1403
01:35:54,213 --> 01:35:56,548
or that your parents
are resting like they are.

1404
01:36:00,177 --> 01:36:01,428
Do you hear me, Alex?

1405
01:36:08,352 --> 01:36:09,353
Watch.

1406
01:36:12,147 --> 01:36:13,232
Ooh.

1407
01:36:23,534 --> 01:36:24,910
Are you watching?

1408
01:36:36,255 --> 01:36:37,548
Stop!

1409
01:36:38,632 --> 01:36:39,800
Stop, Dad!

1410
01:36:42,261 --> 01:36:43,428
Alex.

1411
01:36:52,604 --> 01:36:53,647
Sit down.

1412
01:37:05,284 --> 01:37:07,494
Now, when I tell you
that you are not to speak

1413
01:37:07,578 --> 01:37:10,455
about me or your parents
to anyone...

1414
01:37:12,082 --> 01:37:15,377
you understand what can happen
if you break your promise.

1415
01:37:18,714 --> 01:37:20,465
I can make your parents
hurt themselves.

1416
01:37:20,549 --> 01:37:22,467
I can make them
hurt each other.

1417
01:37:25,721 --> 01:37:28,515
I can make them eat each other
if I want to.

1418
01:37:32,352 --> 01:37:34,021
Do I want to, Alex?

1419
01:37:36,648 --> 01:37:38,066
Do you believe me?

1420
01:37:42,237 --> 01:37:43,572
Promise you will not
talk about me

1421
01:37:43,655 --> 01:37:45,991
to another human being.
Say it.

1422
01:37:47,451 --> 01:37:48,577
I promise.

1423
01:37:50,329 --> 01:37:51,705
'Cause I'll know, Alex.

1424
01:37:54,917 --> 01:37:56,668
Go to school. Take the bus.

1425
01:38:56,353 --> 01:38:57,729
No talking today.

1426
01:38:59,398 --> 01:39:00,399
Good boy.

1427
01:39:01,859 --> 01:39:03,151
You'll need to
feed your parents.

1428
01:39:03,235 --> 01:39:04,653
There's soup in the cabinet.

1429
01:39:06,822 --> 01:39:08,490
Tomorrow,
you'll get some more.

1430
01:39:29,052 --> 01:39:30,596
[students shouting,
chattering]

1431
01:39:53,827 --> 01:39:54,995
[Gladys, distant] Alex.

1432
01:39:59,625 --> 01:40:00,626
Alex?

1433
01:40:23,649 --> 01:40:24,942
Come here, sweetie.

1434
01:40:26,026 --> 01:40:27,694
[labored breathing]

1435
01:40:31,573 --> 01:40:32,616
Oh.

1436
01:40:36,328 --> 01:40:38,038
I'm very sick, Alex.

1437
01:40:40,374 --> 01:40:42,125
Would you like some water?

1438
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:44,545
Well, water won't help me.

1439
01:40:45,671 --> 01:40:47,381
I'm too sick for water.

1440
01:40:48,590 --> 01:40:50,759
I have been
for a very long time.

1441
01:40:52,469 --> 01:40:53,929
What will make you better?

1442
01:40:56,723 --> 01:40:58,350
Well, I was hoping
your mom and dad

1443
01:40:58,433 --> 01:40:59,643
would make me feel better,

1444
01:40:59,726 --> 01:41:02,396
but it doesn't seem to be
turning out so good.

1445
01:41:03,105 --> 01:41:05,190
Would you like to go
to a hospital?

1446
01:41:05,983 --> 01:41:08,068
Hospital won't fix me.

1447
01:41:13,657 --> 01:41:15,117
But maybe you could, though.

1448
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:16,493
You could help.

1449
01:41:17,369 --> 01:41:18,370
How?

1450
01:41:19,246 --> 01:41:20,414
Well, at school,

1451
01:41:21,582 --> 01:41:25,085
bring an object from each
of your classmates home to me.

1452
01:41:26,170 --> 01:41:27,337
That might work.

1453
01:41:28,714 --> 01:41:30,299
How will that make you better?

1454
01:41:34,011 --> 01:41:36,138
It might be just what I need.

1455
01:41:39,308 --> 01:41:41,810
And if you got better,
you'd go back home?

1456
01:41:45,772 --> 01:41:47,274
If I got better...

1457
01:41:49,610 --> 01:41:51,028
I'd go back home.

1458
01:41:54,281 --> 01:41:55,365
[laughs]

1459
01:42:52,005 --> 01:42:53,006
Alex.

1460
01:42:54,967 --> 01:42:56,510
What are you doing in here?

1461
01:42:56,593 --> 01:42:59,137
Um, I didn't
feel like playing,

1462
01:42:59,221 --> 01:43:01,223
and I forgot something.

1463
01:43:02,641 --> 01:43:04,601
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey.

1464
01:43:08,063 --> 01:43:09,064
Are you okay?

1465
01:43:09,690 --> 01:43:11,149
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

1466
01:43:12,109 --> 01:43:14,778
You've been
awful quiet lately.

1467
01:43:15,445 --> 01:43:16,613
Quieter than usual.

1468
01:43:17,281 --> 01:43:18,323
How are you doing?

1469
01:43:18,866 --> 01:43:21,326
I'm okay.
I just forgot something.

1470
01:43:22,244 --> 01:43:23,245
It's okay.

1471
01:43:25,372 --> 01:43:26,832
Alex, you know,

1472
01:43:26,915 --> 01:43:29,543
if... you ever want to talk
to someone,

1473
01:43:30,043 --> 01:43:31,461
you can always talk to me.

1474
01:43:33,046 --> 01:43:34,256
Do you know that?

1475
01:43:34,339 --> 01:43:35,424
Yeah.

1476
01:43:35,507 --> 01:43:37,759
You can talk to me
about anything you want.

1477
01:43:41,263 --> 01:43:42,639
I wanna go back now.

1478
01:43:44,558 --> 01:43:46,518
Okay. Go play.

1479
01:44:22,012 --> 01:44:23,138
[clanking]

1480
01:44:24,681 --> 01:44:26,350
[scraping, muffled speech]

1481
01:44:27,601 --> 01:44:29,228
[noise continuing]

1482
01:44:43,825 --> 01:44:45,077
What are you doing?

1483
01:45:07,891 --> 01:45:09,059
[rings]

1484
01:46:31,892 --> 01:46:33,143
[Justine laughing]

1485
01:46:33,227 --> 01:46:34,228
No...

1486
01:46:44,029 --> 01:46:46,281
[Gladys] Stephen here suffered
a stroke a little while back,

1487
01:46:46,365 --> 01:46:48,158
so he's unable to speak.

1488
01:46:48,242 --> 01:46:50,827
And I'm taking care of
the family for the time being.

1489
01:46:51,328 --> 01:46:53,038
I'm glad you both are here.

1490
01:46:53,121 --> 01:46:55,249
Alex, how are you doing, pal?

1491
01:46:55,332 --> 01:46:56,583
I'm okay.

1492
01:46:56,667 --> 01:46:58,210
Now, we're gonna ask you
some questions

1493
01:46:58,293 --> 01:47:00,128
about what happened
at school, okay?

1494
01:47:02,464 --> 01:47:04,299
Tomorrow,
people will come here.

1495
01:47:05,926 --> 01:47:07,845
And they will search
this house...

1496
01:47:12,516 --> 01:47:14,309
and we have to be ready.

1497
01:47:31,994 --> 01:47:33,662
[doorbell rings]

1498
01:47:33,745 --> 01:47:35,205
Detective, come in!

1499
01:47:35,289 --> 01:47:36,290
Good morning, Ms. Lilly.

1500
01:47:36,373 --> 01:47:37,541
-How are you today?
-Fine.

1501
01:47:37,624 --> 01:47:39,376
-Good to see you again.
-Nice to see you too.

1502
01:47:39,459 --> 01:47:41,086
-Remember Detective Colbert?
-Oh, yes.

1503
01:47:41,170 --> 01:47:43,547
We just wanted to come by the
house for a few minutes today

1504
01:47:43,630 --> 01:47:44,840
and look around, uh,

1505
01:47:44,923 --> 01:47:47,801
see the environment
that Alex has been living in.

1506
01:47:47,885 --> 01:47:51,346
And just get an idea of what
the family dynamic is like.

1507
01:47:51,430 --> 01:47:53,599
-Okay!
-Oh. Thank you.

1508
01:47:53,682 --> 01:47:54,683
And... Oh.

1509
01:47:54,766 --> 01:47:56,602
Hey, Alex.
How are you doing today?

1510
01:47:57,644 --> 01:47:58,896
He's a little quiet today,
right?

1511
01:47:58,979 --> 01:48:00,689
-Mm-hmm. Yes, he is.
-Okay.

1512
01:49:05,128 --> 01:49:06,213
Hello?

1513
01:49:15,013 --> 01:49:17,182
Pack your things, Alex,
we're leaving tomorrow.

1514
01:49:20,352 --> 01:49:21,979
Don't step over the salt.

1515
01:49:54,970 --> 01:49:57,389
The cops are here.
What do you think that means?

1516
01:49:59,766 --> 01:50:00,809
I don't know.

1517
01:50:02,144 --> 01:50:03,562
Do we knock? Do we come back?

1518
01:50:03,645 --> 01:50:05,105
Maybe we knock.

1519
01:50:05,606 --> 01:50:08,317
And say what? What...
What are we gonna explain?

1520
01:50:11,320 --> 01:50:12,196
Yeah, I don't know.

1521
01:50:12,279 --> 01:50:13,322
-Let's just...
-Here we go.

1522
01:50:14,948 --> 01:50:16,158
Hey, what is this?

1523
01:50:29,171 --> 01:50:30,214
Is that the cop?

1524
01:50:31,548 --> 01:50:33,050
That's Paul.

1525
01:50:33,133 --> 01:50:35,093
-You know him?
-Yeah.

1526
01:51:07,042 --> 01:51:08,627
[creaking]

1527
01:51:15,676 --> 01:51:16,677
Hello?

Paul?

1529
01:51:46,206 --> 01:51:48,709
[voice trembling] Paul,
what are you doing back there?

1530
01:51:48,792 --> 01:51:49,626
