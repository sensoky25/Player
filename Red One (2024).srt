35
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:47,332
Not you.

What are you doing, pal?

37
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:53,582
Look, we love having you here
for the holidays,

38
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:55,290
but what are you telling your cousins?

39
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:56,833
The cold, hard truth.

40
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:01,415
Cold, hard truth?

41
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:03,624
Jack, these are presents, yes,

42
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,790
- but these aren't Santa's presents.
- Right.

43
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:08,707
Because Santa Claus hasn't been here yet.

44
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,707
It's Christmas Eve. He's coming tonight.

45
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:16,082
He's coming here, to this house, tonight?

46
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:18,499
- That's what you're telling me?
- That's what I'm telling you.

47
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,749
And he's also going
to every other house in the world

48
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,624
on the same night,

49
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:26,040
using flying reindeer for transportation?

50
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,207
Yes, Jack.

51
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:30,416
And what fuels a flying reindeer exactly?

52
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:34,165
Carrots.

53
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,749
Okay, look, I don't know
exactly how it works.

54
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:42,625
All I know is, when we wake up tomorrow,
Santa will have been here.

55
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,457
All right.

56
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:46,832

71
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,833

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,624
Evening, ladies.

177
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,958
What are you so excited about?

178
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,499
Oh. Of course.

179
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,458
Your boyfriend's here.

180
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,749
Hey, girls.

181
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,165
Okay. Okay.

182
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:03,875
Of course I didn't forget.

183
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,833
Yes, I brought extra.

184
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,000
Who's hungry?

185
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,916
There we go.

186
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:17,999
Cal.

187
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,374
Come on, man. Clock's ticking.

188
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:51,874
Red One, you are clear for takeoff.

189
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:54,332
All right, ladies.

190
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:55,791
Let's go home.

191
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,207
Thanks for the escort, fellas.

192
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,583
See you next year.

193
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:39,416
<i>Kavalame!</i>

194
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,416
Come on, Morris.

195
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:22,707
<i>Go ahead.</i>

196
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:23,790
I got it.

197
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,624
I don't know what the hell it is,
but I got it.

198
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,165
<i>Send the coordinates.</i>

199
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:31,207
Well, why don't you
send something my way first?

200
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:35,958
<i>Wiring the first half now,
the rest when the data is verified.</i>

201
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,332
Pleasure doing business with you.

202
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,874
Yes! Yes!

203
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,124
Yes!

204
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,415
<i>He's staggering.</i>

205
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:45,708
<i>- He's in the corner!</i>
- No.

206
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,790
- No.
<i>- Morris is down!</i>

207
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:52,082
No! Oh, my God.

208
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,875
Home sweet home.

209
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,790
Whoa, ladies.

210
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,250
- Red, welcome back.
- Thank you.

211
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,083
Where's the missus?

212
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,165
I'm-I'm right here.

213
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,915
Deliverables was a half hour ago.

214
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:28,124
Larry, this is going to Bermuda.

215
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,582
Copy that. Bermuda.

216
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,249
Garcia.

217
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,458
Welcome back, chief.

218
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,207
- What'd I miss?
- Nothing.

219
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,999
Everyone's working.

220
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,415
There's a bottleneck in ribbons.

221
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:40,624
Phil is blaming wrapping.

222
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,415
Wrapping says Phil's being overdramatic.

223
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,290
Everybody's feeling the heat.

224
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,582
All right. I'll talk to him.

225
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:48,582
Please. Phil's driving everybody nuts.

226
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:51,332
Phil in ribbons
is having a total meltdown.

227
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,999
Maybe it's time to find
a less stressful spot for Phil.

228
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,290
I don't know, tinsel?

229
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,749
Phil out of ribbons?

230
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,040
Just a thought.

231
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,540
He's got a dog named Ribbons.

232
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,708
Yeah, right.

233
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,582
Four ninety-five. Four ninety-six.

234
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,582
Four ninety-seven. Four ninety-eight.

235
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,291
Four ninety-nine. Five hundred.

236
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,165
In five minutes. Not bad.

237
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,749
Yeah, getting warmed up.

238
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,124
All right,
I'm gonna run the simulation model

239
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,832
on Belgium and Holland again
just to be safe.

240
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:19,040
- Thank you, sweetie.
- All right, if you need me, yell.

241
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,124
Hey, Callum. Jump in there.

242
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,624
Get him ready, okay?

243
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:25,208
- It's almost showtime.
- Yes, ma'am. Will do.

244
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,124
Hey, boss.

245
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,958
Cal.

246
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,708
- Give me a spot, huh?
- Got it.

247
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,875
Up.

248
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,708
Tell me why.

249
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,540
Time for a change, Nick.

250
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,249
- It's like I told you.
- Yeah, I heard you.

251
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,708
And I'll respect your decision,
but I want to know why.

252
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,750
- Let's go heavy.
- Yeah. Got it.

253
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:29,207
You're looking strong.

254
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,207
We work for the kids, Cal.

255
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,082
We do it for them.

256
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,415
And I know you love that.

257
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,500
You live for that.

258
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,832
So, what's going on here?

259
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,958
I love the kids.

260
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,791
It's the grown-ups that are killing me.

261
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,000
Go on.

262
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,415
- The list.
- What about the list?

263
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,707
We're up almost 22% year over year.

264
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,249
I'm aware of the numbers, Cal.

265
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,541
What are you getting at?

266
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,665
For the first time ever, more people
are on the Naughty List than not.

267
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,791
And it's like they don't even care.

268
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,750
So much bad behavior out there
everywhere you look.

269
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,833
Uh, you say it all the time, Nick.

270
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,957
We choose every day who we want to be.

271
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:22,249
With big decisions and little ones,

272
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,583
and every one of them matters.

273
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:30,708
But I look around,
and they act like none of it matters.

274
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:37,416
If nothing matters to them, it seems to me
they need us now more than ever.

275
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,875
That's why there's only one you.

276
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:47,165
And no one with my doubts
should be so close to you.

277
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,249
You need somebody younger,

278
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:53,040
someone 300 years old, in their prime,
who wants to change things.

279
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:56,082
Not our job to change people, Cal.

280
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,999
People change themselves.

281
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,499
We just show 'em that we believe in 'em.

282
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,499
All of 'em.

283
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,915
'Cause we know who they really are,
down deep.

284
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:11,249
We know that somewhere
inside every lost grown-up

285
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,249
is the kid they once were.

286
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:18,375
Our gift is that we can see that,
even when they can't.

287
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:24,249
We work for the kids, Cal,

288
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,000
even when they're not kids anymore.

289
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,833
I'm just having a really hard time
seeing it.

290
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,041
And that's why.

291
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,208
Let's have a cookie.

292
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:44,000
The answer to everything.

293
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:46,582
Got to carb up.

294
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,249
You know, I burn about 400--

295
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,415
You burn 430 million calories
every Christmas Eve.

296
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:52,833
- Yeah.
- Yes, I know.

297
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,708
One last ride, huh?

298
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,208
One last ride.

299
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:07,832
Mmm.

300
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:37,833
Here!

301
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,791
Get to it, Lads.

302
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,457
Alpha check. It's Drift.

303
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,915
Looks like a light just fried
on the anterior west face

304
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:56,540
up around mail room 19-B.

305
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:57,707
Anyone up there?

306
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,457
<i>Yeah,
this is Jeff in maintenance.</i>

307
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:01,165
<i>You don't miss a thing, Commander.</i>

308
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:03,416
<i>- I'll check it out.</i>
- Thanks, Jeff.

309
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,415
Hey, Jeff, looks like we got
a few more of 'em, too.

310
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:13,457
What's going on up there?

311
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,250
Jeff?

312
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:18,916
Jeff, do you copy?

313
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:21,790
Who's with Red?

314
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:23,374
<i>Arthur,
is he still with you?</i>

315
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,540
Negative, chief.

316
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:27,500
-  <i>Kenny, do you have him?</i>
- Not in the gym.

317
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:30,915
Who's with Red?

318
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,540
Gorman, are you in the residence?

319
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:33,957
<i>Finkle just took over.</i>

320
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:36,040
Finkle. Finkle!

321
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:38,666
I need eyes on Red now!

322
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,624
- Mail room, negative.
- Study, negative.

323
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,999
Mistletoe hydroponics, negative.

324
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,415
He's not in the gallery.

325
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:52,040
<i>Logistics, negative.</i>

326
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:53,332
<i>Anteroom, negative.</i>

327
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:54,707
<i>Candy cane packaging, negative.</i>

328
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:56,124
<i>Nursery, negative.</i>

329
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:15,416
Nick. Nick!

330
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:20,582
Breach!

331
00:23:20,583 --> 00:23:22,707
- We have a breach!
-  Does anyone have eyes?

332
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:42,833
Code green! Code green! Full lockdown!

333
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:45,707
Armored snowcat heading north.

334
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:47,415
Copy that.

335
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:49,415
- Locating.
-  Who has eyes?

336
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:50,915
- Just turned right on Pine.
-  Copy.

337
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:53,166
Containment barrier five going up.

338
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:58,750
Street unit six, deploy.

339
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:08,333
Box 'em in!

340
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:17,583
Agents down.

341
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:30,957
Raise barrier 72!

342
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:32,708
Raising 72.

343
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,082
Snowcat just turned left on Candlestick.

344
00:25:21,708 --> 00:25:24,166
There's a hole in the dome.

345
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:38,707
<i>What the hell just happened?</i>

346
00:26:38,708 --> 00:26:40,582
- There's been a breach, Director.
<i>- I know.</i>

347
00:26:40,583 --> 00:26:43,374
Red has been taken.

348
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:45,707
<i>What? Where's Cal?</i>

349
00:26:45,708 --> 00:26:47,540
- I'm right here.
<i>- Cal, what happened?</i>

350
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:49,665
<i>- Who could've done this?</i>
- Zoe, I don't know.

351
00:26:49,666 --> 00:26:51,082
<i>We are 24 hours to Christmas Eve.</i>

352
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:52,750
<i>- We cannot--</i>
- Yes, I'm well aware.

353
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:57,082
<i>Okay. Okay, let's take a deep breath.</i>

354
00:26:58,375 --> 00:26:59,915
<i>Start from the beginning.</i>

355
00:26:59,916 --> 00:27:03,582
They cut a hole in the CF Dome
using an atomic plasma torch.

356
00:27:03,583 --> 00:27:06,957
From the footprints, I'd say
there's eight to ten of them-- human.

357
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,207
They rolled in
on a remote armored snowcat,

358
00:27:09,208 --> 00:27:11,540
which they used as a diversion
before they blasted out of here

359
00:27:11,541 --> 00:27:13,082
in a NORAD-blind cargo jet.

360
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:14,374
<i>Good God, Cal.</i>

361
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:15,957
I'm gonna find 'em, Zoe.

362
00:27:15,958 --> 00:27:17,750
<i>We're gonna work together on this.</i>

363
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:20,790
<i>We were just told that someone hacked</i>

364
00:27:20,791 --> 00:27:22,332
<i>the Intercontinental
Seismic Surveillance System.</i>

365
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:25,165
<i>I don't know if it's related,
but if someone knew where to look,</i>

366
00:27:25,166 --> 00:27:27,165
<i>that's the only vulnerability
in the cloaking.</i>

367
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:28,790
Who?

368
00:27:28,791 --> 00:27:31,332
<i>We don't know yet.
The trolls are scouring the Web.</i>

369
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:33,207
Name and address.

370
00:27:33,208 --> 00:27:34,457
<i>They're working on it.</i>

371
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:37,040
Then tell 'em to work faster.
We don't have time for this.

372
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:39,374
Director, the trolls have a trace.

373
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:40,749
<i>Patch them in.</i>

374
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,249
<i>What have you got?</i>

375
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,415
<i>We traced the relays.</i>

376
00:27:43,416 --> 00:27:44,582
<i>Looks like The Wolf.</i>

377
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:48,082
<i>The Wolf.</i>

378
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,249
Who the hell is The Wolf?

379
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:53,749
<i>Mercenary, bounty hunter,
works for the highest bidder.</i>

380
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,624
<i>A ghost on the dark web.</i>

381
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:58,791
<i>FBI's been trying to recruit him
for years, but he's a freelancer.</i>

382
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:02,291
<i>He's probably
the best tracker in the world.</i>

383
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:04,458
<i>The guy's a legend.</i>

384
00:28:18,375 --> 00:28:19,457
What?

385
00:28:19,458 --> 00:28:21,290
Nice. Are you in town?

386
00:28:21,291 --> 00:28:22,457
<i>That depends.</i>

387
00:28:22,458 --> 00:28:24,290
- What do you want?
<i>- I need you to do me a favor</i>

388
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:25,624
and go pick up Dylan.

389
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:27,332
<i>I'm right in the middle
of something important.</i>

390
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:29,082
This isn't a good time for me.

391
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:30,374
<i>Yeah. Me, either.</i>

392
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,457
I have two mothers-to-be
with weakening contractions

393
00:28:32,458 --> 00:28:34,665
and labor that's not progressing,
and Craig's out of town.

394
00:28:34,666 --> 00:28:36,165
Liv.

395
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:37,332
Dylan got in trouble at school.

396
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:39,707
I just need you to go pick him up
and drop him off at my place.

397
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:41,082
- Liv.
<i>- Jack.</i>

398
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:42,582
I'm stuck at work, and Craig's away,

399
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:44,999
so just do me a favor
and go pick up your kid.

400
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:01,332
I got it.

401
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:02,666
I got it. I got it, I got it, I got it.

402
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:06,041
Hey, buddy.

403
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:11,582
- Hey, you got any aspirin?
- What?

404
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,541
No.

405
00:29:15,166 --> 00:29:17,082
<i>I got to get
something in my stomach.</i>

406
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:18,957
- You want a churro?
- No.

407
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:22,125
Shut up!

408
00:29:24,625 --> 00:29:27,082
Hey, man. Can I get two?

409
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:29,916
- I don't want a churro.
- I heard you. They're for me.

410
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:33,790
So, what are they saying you did?

411
00:29:33,791 --> 00:29:37,415
Tampered with the school's
attendance records, which I did.

412
00:29:37,416 --> 00:29:39,207
Allegedly.

413
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:41,082
Never admit that.

414
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:42,499
Thank you. Have a good day.

415
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,499
Yeah, yeah.

416
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:50,457
The music teacher leaves his computer open
during fifth period.

417
00:29:50,458 --> 00:29:51,915
Mm-hmm.

418
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:53,915
I started to ditch science
so I could go and practice guitar,

419
00:29:53,916 --> 00:29:55,165
then I'd change it on the computer.

420
00:29:55,166 --> 00:29:56,665
Makes sense.

421
00:29:56,666 --> 00:29:59,915
There's this girl in jazz band, Piper.

422
00:29:59,916 --> 00:30:02,624
She started to ditch with me,
but then Kevin--

423
00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:03,915
Who's Kevin?

424
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:05,957
My best friend. At least he was.

425
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:07,374
What'd Kevin do?

426
00:30:07,375 --> 00:30:09,124
Kevin found out and wanted to ditch, too.

427
00:30:09,125 --> 00:30:10,749
But he's not even in jazz band.

428
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,457
He just wanted to hang out with Piper.

429
00:30:12,458 --> 00:30:14,249
I was the one hanging out with Piper.

430
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,540
So I'm supposed to go in
and change his absent to present

431
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:19,040
- so he can hang out with Piper?
- It's bullshit.

432
00:30:19,041 --> 00:30:21,124
So, instead,
I gave him three more absents.

433
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:23,332
Good. Send a message.

434
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:24,790
He got busted and told the vice principal.

435
00:30:24,791 --> 00:30:26,500
Kevin.

436
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:29,166
So I slashed the tires on his bike.

437
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,999
- I know, you're disappointed.
- I am disappointed.

438
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:40,040
Look, if you're gonna hack a mainframe,
you do it quietly.

439
00:30:40,041 --> 00:30:41,582
You go in through a back door,
no fingerprints.

440
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:44,040
But more importantly,
the second this kid Kevin

441
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:46,665
knew what you were doing,
you got a loose end.

442
00:30:46,666 --> 00:30:49,832
Never trust anybody. Anybody.

443
00:30:49,833 --> 00:30:53,375
And never let someone get the upper hand
on you, 'cause they'll use it.

444
00:30:56,791 --> 00:30:57,791
Yeah.

445
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,124
All right, I got to go practice.

446
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:11,207
I have this dumb winter pageant thing
tonight for jazz band.

447
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:13,499
A pageant? Oof.

448
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,165
I know.

449
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:17,124
I said it was dumb.

450
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,250
Good luck.

451
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,750
- We're gonna talk when I come in.
-  I know.

452
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:28,582
- Thought labor wasn't progressing.
- Yeah, then it did.

453
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:30,540
Thanks for picking him up, though.

454
00:31:30,541 --> 00:31:33,332
I don't know what's going on
with him these days. He's acting out.

455
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:35,749
Yeah, well, you know, growing up is tough.

456
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,665
Is that why you're avoiding it?

457
00:31:37,666 --> 00:31:40,040
- I walked right into that.
- Yeah.

458
00:31:40,041 --> 00:31:41,624
Yeah.

459
00:31:41,625 --> 00:31:43,124
He'd really love to see you
more often, Jack.

460
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:44,582
I just picked him up.

461
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:46,665
- I know.
- It was really nice. We had a good talk.

462
00:31:46,666 --> 00:31:48,665
He told me about school.
I mean, I don't know what--

463
00:31:48,666 --> 00:31:50,624
He would love that to happen more often,
is all I'm saying.

464
00:31:50,625 --> 00:31:51,958
I got to go to work.

465
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,499
Okay.

466
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,000
Merry Christmas, Jack.

467
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,415
Yeah.

468
00:32:00,416 --> 00:32:03,165

Hi, Jack.

477
00:34:48,041 --> 00:34:49,999
We know what you did.

478
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,624
Huh?

479
00:34:51,625 --> 00:34:53,250
We know what you did.

480
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:00,666
Okay. Um...

481
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:05,041
First of all, sorry.

482
00:35:06,208 --> 00:35:09,040
Second, could you be more specific?

483
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:11,624
Honestly, you could be talking
about 12 different things right now.

484
00:35:11,625 --> 00:35:13,125
Who are you working for?

485
00:35:14,708 --> 00:35:16,832
Lady, I don't know
what you're talking about.

486
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:18,582
I work for whoever pays me.

487
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:19,957
You have about 40 seconds

488
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:22,332
to become helpful
before you have a terrible accident,

489
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:24,665
so I'm gonna ask you one more time:

490
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:26,915
Who hired you to find him?

491
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,457
- Find who?
- You know who.

492
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:30,040
I promise you I don't.

493
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:31,540
If I did, I would tell you.

494
00:35:31,541 --> 00:35:33,791
I'm not a scrupulous person.
You can ask anybody.

495
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,874
The Intercontinental
Seismic Surveillance System.

496
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:39,083
Sound familiar?

497
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:43,957
Yeah. I did that.

498
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:45,165
It was a weird job.

499
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:47,249
Somebody was trying to find someone
who was running tests

500
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:50,207
on some weapons systems
in the arctic, and I...

501
00:35:50,208 --> 00:35:52,374
I found the location, and I walked.

502
00:35:52,375 --> 00:35:53,665
For who?

503
00:35:53,666 --> 00:35:55,040
I don't know.

504
00:35:55,041 --> 00:35:58,207
I'm telling you, all the communication
is encrypted and untraceable.

505
00:35:58,208 --> 00:35:59,957
That's how it's supposed to be

506
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:02,916
so if someone like you shows up
I don't have any answers.

507
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,457
Look, I don't ask questions.

508
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:07,749
I just find people
that no one else can find.

509
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,291
It's what I do.

510
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:16,790
You really don't know what you did.

511
00:36:16,791 --> 00:36:19,165
I guess not.

512
00:36:19,166 --> 00:36:21,458
I mean, I can tell
you're very upset about it, though.

513
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:27,332
Box him up.

514
00:36:27,333 --> 00:36:28,874
Box me up?

515
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:30,457
Wait, wait. What do you mean? Hey.

516
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,750
Is this really necessary?

517
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,791
Ow.

518
00:37:03,041 --> 00:37:04,290
Cool place.

519
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:06,500
How long you been here?

520
00:37:07,666 --> 00:37:08,790
M-O-R-A?

521
00:37:08,791 --> 00:37:10,249
MORA.

522
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:12,749
The Mythological Oversight
and Restoration Authority.

523
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,332
Come again?

524
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:16,374
We are the multilateral
international organization

525
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:19,625
responsible for securing and protecting
the mythological world.

526
00:37:21,708 --> 00:37:22,833
Come with me.

527
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,249
- Did you say "the mythological world"?
- Yes.

528
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,374
Right.

529
00:37:29,375 --> 00:37:33,124
So, uh, bigfoot,

530
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,749
Loch Ness Monster, that kind of thing?

531
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,082
That kind of thing.

532
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:39,499
Okay, so...

533
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,665
things that don't actually exist,
you guys are responsible for.

534
00:37:42,666 --> 00:37:44,040
Got it.

535
00:37:45,708 --> 00:37:47,166
Holy shit!

536
00:38:01,333 --> 00:38:03,207
If he knows anything, he ain't talking.

537
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:05,790
All right. Horse back to the pen,
body back to Area 32.

538
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:07,915
And get the pumpkin
back in the cryo-vault stat.

539
00:38:07,916 --> 00:38:09,499
Yes, Director.

540
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,124
What the hell was that?

541
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:12,415
The Horseman.

542
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:14,958
We're questioning all the usual suspects.

543
00:38:16,541 --> 00:38:18,875
The Headless Horseman?

544
00:38:19,958 --> 00:38:22,665
Hey. What did that
Taser thing do to my head?

545
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:24,874
It's not a Taser. It's an Acquiescer.

546
00:38:24,875 --> 00:38:27,833
Just take a deep breath
and have a seat, Jack.

547
00:38:46,833 --> 00:38:48,458
What am I doing here?

548
00:38:50,916 --> 00:38:54,540
Last night, at roughly 11:00 p.m. NPST,

549
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:58,374
Red One, also known
as Saint Nicholas of Myra,

550
00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:01,291
was abducted from the North Pole complex.

551
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:08,957
The data you retrieved from the I-Triple-S
was used to pinpoint the location,

552
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:12,166
which has been secure and classified
for several hundred years.

553
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,165
Use your words.

554
00:39:22,166 --> 00:39:25,540
Are you saying...

555
00:39:25,541 --> 00:39:29,165
Santa Claus has been kidnapped?

556
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:31,707
And you think I had
something to do with it?

557
00:39:31,708 --> 00:39:32,999
Where is he?

558
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:37,375
Is that him?

559
00:39:38,791 --> 00:39:43,041
Jack "The Wolf" O'Malley,
meet Callum Drift, commander of the E.L.F.

560
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:45,540
The E.L.F.?

561
00:39:45,541 --> 00:39:47,290
Turns out Jack here didn't know
what he was doing.

562
00:39:47,291 --> 00:39:50,499
Somebody hired him to find the complex,
and incredibly, he did.

563
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,915
Who?

564
00:39:51,916 --> 00:39:53,624
- He doesn't know.
- I don't know.

565
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:55,874
- Yes, he does.
- No, he doesn't.

566
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:57,832
They always know something.

567
00:39:57,833 --> 00:40:00,041
Sometimes you just
got to shake it out of 'em.

568
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:03,124
I'm not gonna like you.

569
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:06,125
I can tell right away, out of
everyone here, I like you the least.

570
00:40:07,458 --> 00:40:08,625
Garcia.

571
00:40:12,791 --> 00:40:14,957
What the...

572
00:40:14,958 --> 00:40:16,624
Yeah, chief.

573
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:18,499
-  This guy's not cooperating.
-  Ah.

574
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,249
Should we do the thing?

575
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:21,749
I'm afraid we're gonna have to.

576
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,665
- Cal, let's talk about this for a minute.
- There's nothing to talk about.

577
00:40:23,666 --> 00:40:25,415
You can't trust this guy.
He's on the list.

578
00:40:25,416 --> 00:40:27,499
- What list?
- You know damn well what list.

579
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,583
Look, I'm not on any watch list.
I know for a fact that...

580
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,665
Wait a minute.

581
00:40:32,666 --> 00:40:33,832
You don't mean--

582
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:35,957
Yes, that list. You're on it. I checked.

583
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:37,790
- NL-Four.
-  Are you telling me

584
00:40:37,791 --> 00:40:41,040
this clown is a Level Four Naughty Lister?

585
00:40:41,041 --> 00:40:44,624
- A Level Four Naughty Lister?
- Oh, is that funny to you?

586
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:46,624
Hey, hey, hey. What are we doing here?

587
00:40:46,625 --> 00:40:48,415
- Come on.
-  I know this is killing you,

588
00:40:48,416 --> 00:40:49,749
but you have to trust me.

589
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,290
Dismembering this shit bag
isn't gonna help.

590
00:40:51,291 --> 00:40:53,915
It would feel good, but it won't help.

591
00:40:53,916 --> 00:40:55,124
I'm right here.

592
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:56,208
Shut up.

593
00:40:58,208 --> 00:41:00,582
- What are you thinking?
- We're gonna put him to work.

594
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:03,165
- No, absolutely not.
- Excuse me?

595
00:41:03,166 --> 00:41:05,790
You said you work for whoever pays you.

596
00:41:05,791 --> 00:41:06,874
Today that's me.

597
00:41:06,875 --> 00:41:08,832
He's not telling us everything he knows.
Look at him.

598
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,124
He is telling us
everything he knows.

599
00:41:10,125 --> 00:41:11,415
He just doesn't know who hired him.

600
00:41:11,416 --> 00:41:14,957
Well, I mean,
how much are we talking here?

601
00:41:14,958 --> 00:41:17,665
Garcia.

602
00:41:17,666 --> 00:41:18,957
Okay.

603
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:22,457
Okay. I don't know who it was,
but I can figure out where they are.

604
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:24,833
Or where they were last night.

605
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:27,833
God.

606
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:34,207
Look, it is anonymous--
I don't know who it is--

607
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:38,915
but in my line of work, I need insurance,
you know, in case of billing issues,

608
00:41:38,916 --> 00:41:41,082
so I Trojan-horse a digital tracking bug

609
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:42,832
- into their VPN.
- Are you saying--

610
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:43,957
Yeah, I can track the device.

611
00:41:43,958 --> 00:41:45,374
Then I suggest you do it.

612
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:47,124
Can we circle back
on the whole paying me thing?

613
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:49,124
I know what they paid you.
We'll double it.

614
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:51,249
- Triple.
- Garcia.

615
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,915
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Come on!

616
00:41:52,916 --> 00:41:56,249
All right, all right. Double's fine.
It's Christmas.

617
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,415
Wise choice.

618
00:41:57,416 --> 00:41:59,083
I need my cell phone.

619
00:42:05,666 --> 00:42:08,415
Whoever did this...

620
00:42:08,416 --> 00:42:10,249
- is in Aruba.
- Where in Aruba?

621
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,499
I work alone.

622
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,457
- You used to.
- No offense,

623
00:42:13,458 --> 00:42:16,290
but I'm not rolling into Aruba undercover
with a giant elf.

624
00:42:16,291 --> 00:42:18,290
It's E.L.F.!

625
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:20,332
-  Cal.
- We can't trust this guy.

626
00:42:20,333 --> 00:42:22,332
That's why you're holding the leash.

627
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:23,582
And this...

628
00:42:25,083 --> 00:42:27,582
...is how I can find you
anywhere on Earth.

629
00:42:27,583 --> 00:42:29,374
You're mine until we find him.

630
00:42:29,375 --> 00:42:31,166
I suggest you get going.

631
00:42:33,666 --> 00:42:36,416
Claws!

632
00:43:01,041 --> 00:43:03,124
Well, this is unfortunate.

633
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:06,582
No, this is what needed to be done.

634
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:08,958
I sincerely doubt that.

635
00:43:10,416 --> 00:43:14,541
You know, I know a guy
who's gonna be very upset about this.

636
00:43:20,583 --> 00:43:22,083
What are you gonna do with that?

637
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:26,041
The world is a mess
because they fear nothing.

638
00:43:27,916 --> 00:43:30,750
I'm going to give them something to fear.

639
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,915
I'm going to do in one night

640
00:43:34,916 --> 00:43:38,874
what you have failed to do for centuries.

641
00:43:38,875 --> 00:43:40,957
And what is that?

642
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:43,500
I'm gonna make the world a better place.

643
00:43:53,583 --> 00:43:54,749
What are you doing?

644
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:57,125
Borrowing some of your energy.

645
00:44:00,041 --> 00:44:01,458
Now...

646
00:44:02,833 --> 00:44:05,333
...go to sleep, Nicholas.

647
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:08,791
Go to sleep.

648
00:44:38,291 --> 00:44:40,707
We doing some last-minute
Christmas shopping?

649
00:44:40,708 --> 00:44:42,374
Gearing up.

650
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:43,957
Grab a car, something practical.

651
00:44:45,541 --> 00:44:49,249
<i>♪ Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la,
deck the halls...</i>

652
00:44:57,083 --> 00:44:58,083
Here.

653
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,833
Let's go.

654
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,915
<i>♪ Strike the harp and join the chorus ♪</i>

655
00:45:12,916 --> 00:45:15,999
<i>♪ Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la ♪</i>

656
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,665
<i>♪ Follow me in merry measure ♪</i>

657
00:45:18,666 --> 00:45:20,790
<i>♪ Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la...</i>

658
00:45:20,791 --> 00:45:21,957
Ooh!

659
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,749
What the hell just happened?

660
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:44,083
Toy stores.

661
00:45:45,166 --> 00:45:46,749
Toy stores what?

662
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:48,707
The supply closets are portal stations

663
00:45:48,708 --> 00:45:52,207
for the North Pole Field Network
Transit System.

664
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:00,500
Car.

665
00:46:04,958 --> 00:46:06,082
I said practical.

666
00:46:06,083 --> 00:46:07,582
Like what, a minivan?

667
00:46:07,583 --> 00:46:09,124
Who wants a practical Hot Wheels?

668
00:46:09,125 --> 00:46:10,540
Also, what difference does it make?

669
00:46:10,541 --> 00:46:12,707
I gave you a directive.

670
00:46:12,708 --> 00:46:14,124
A directive?

671
00:46:14,125 --> 00:46:17,915
Is that what
you think is going on here?

672
00:46:17,916 --> 00:46:20,207
I'm telling you now,
you better listen to me

673
00:46:20,208 --> 00:46:22,249
because things are about to get real.

674
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:39,582
- How did--
- I adjusted it to reality.

675
00:46:39,583 --> 00:46:41,415
- And does that--
- No, it doesn't work on everything.

676
00:46:41,416 --> 00:46:43,374
No, you can't try it. No, you can't drive.

677
00:46:43,375 --> 00:46:45,249
No more questions. Now, get in.

678
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:46,750
And be careful with those robots.

679
00:47:05,291 --> 00:47:08,791
So you're like the bodyguard
for Santa Claus.

680
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:11,499
I'm the commander of the E.L.F.

681
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:12,957
What's that stand for?

682
00:47:12,958 --> 00:47:14,832
Enforcement, Logistics and Fortification.

683
00:47:14,833 --> 00:47:16,624
But as far as you're concerned,
it stands for

684
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:19,415
Extremely Large and Formidable.

685
00:47:21,208 --> 00:47:23,000
Mm-hmm.

686
00:47:24,791 --> 00:47:28,666
And that's all you do all year, just...
protect Santa?

687
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:32,250
- It's a big job.
- Sure. Sure.

688
00:47:35,083 --> 00:47:36,208
It's one day, though, right?

689
00:47:37,583 --> 00:47:39,165
Like, it's a big job for one day.

690
00:47:39,166 --> 00:47:43,415
We work 364 days a year
because on that one day

691
00:47:43,416 --> 00:47:47,124
we deliver presents
to several billion individual domiciles

692
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:52,290
across 37 time zones without ever
being detected by a single human being.

693
00:47:52,291 --> 00:47:56,624
We prep, we rehearse every moment,
every stop down to the last chimney.

694
00:47:56,625 --> 00:47:58,999
So yeah, it's a lot of work.

695
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,290
Three hundred and sixty-four days?

696
00:48:01,291 --> 00:48:02,416
We have Boxing Day off.

697
00:48:05,625 --> 00:48:07,582
Wouldn't it be easier if you broke it up?

698
00:48:07,583 --> 00:48:11,040
You know, like send different teams out
different places, just more efficient?

699
00:48:11,041 --> 00:48:12,457
No, it doesn't work like that.

700
00:48:12,458 --> 00:48:13,874
He's got to do it all himself?

701
00:48:13,875 --> 00:48:16,207
He doesn't have to. It's his purpose.

702
00:48:16,208 --> 00:48:17,790
He's a singular force in the universe.

703
00:48:17,791 --> 00:48:21,082
Okay, so worst-case scenario--
is there someone that can step in for him,

704
00:48:21,083 --> 00:48:22,665
like a vice Santa Claus?

705
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:24,499
Are you listening to me? No.

706
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,290
No one can do what he does.

707
00:48:26,291 --> 00:48:29,124
He knows when you're sleeping,
he knows when you're awake,

708
00:48:29,125 --> 00:48:32,415
and he knows that about
every single person on this planet.

709
00:48:32,416 --> 00:48:36,290
He has a list the size of Rhode Island,
and he checks it twice.

710
00:48:36,291 --> 00:48:38,124
If you were to try to read that list
just once,

711
00:48:38,125 --> 00:48:40,582
it would take you a decade,
but he does it twice.

712
00:48:40,583 --> 00:48:42,915
And the reason why
he's able to do any of it

713
00:48:42,916 --> 00:48:47,790
is because he is Santa Claus,
the one and only,

714
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:50,750
and no one else can execute his mission.

715
00:48:51,833 --> 00:48:53,082
Which is?

716
00:48:53,083 --> 00:48:55,582
To spread cheer, asshole.

717
00:48:55,583 --> 00:48:57,500
Good feeling.

718
00:49:00,375 --> 00:49:01,750
Ready for a test.

719
00:49:02,833 --> 00:49:03,832
Bring me the weapon.

720
00:49:56,666 --> 00:49:58,207
Duplication complete.

721
00:49:58,208 --> 00:50:00,165
Good.

722
00:50:00,166 --> 00:50:02,499
Now let's see if it works.

723
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,749
Who do you have in mind, Mum?

724
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:07,874
We'll start with
the first name on the list.

725
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:31,208
All right, now we're talking.

726
00:50:32,916 --> 00:50:35,415
Well, it was nice to meet you, Cal.

727
00:50:35,416 --> 00:50:36,957
Good luck with everything.

728
00:50:36,958 --> 00:50:38,249
Thank you so much.

729
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:39,957
I'm just gonna live here now.

730
00:50:39,958 --> 00:50:41,957
- Gonna marry her.
- Why don't you focus?

731
00:50:41,958 --> 00:50:44,124
We got to find your guy.

732
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:46,625
Not a lot of fun, are you, Cal?

733
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:49,874
Oh, I'm fun.

734
00:50:49,875 --> 00:50:52,915
As a matter of fact, I won the prize
for most fun gift wrapper

735
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:55,791
for 183 years in a row.

736
00:50:57,291 --> 00:50:58,500
Well, I take it back.

737
00:51:03,375 --> 00:51:04,915
Want me to show you how to do this?

738
00:51:04,916 --> 00:51:06,540
I would suggest
you give it a shot.

739
00:51:06,541 --> 00:51:09,332
I see the worst in everyone, Cal.

740
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:10,915
It's my gift.

741
00:51:10,916 --> 00:51:12,415
And it's the key to my work.

742
00:51:12,416 --> 00:51:15,583
I can see a person's worst qualities
just by looking at 'em.

743
00:51:16,916 --> 00:51:18,582
See, look at this guy.

744
00:51:18,583 --> 00:51:20,332
He's married but not to her.

745
00:51:20,333 --> 00:51:22,665
That's why he has a tan line
where his wedding ring should be.

746
00:51:22,666 --> 00:51:25,665
This guy's about to screw over that guy.

747
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:27,749
That's why he's laughing too loud.

748
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:31,457
And this guy... now, he's interesting.

749
00:51:31,458 --> 00:51:32,832
Why, you ask?

750
00:51:32,833 --> 00:51:34,832
- I didn't ask.
- Well, I'll tell you.

751
00:51:34,833 --> 00:51:36,874
Shoes.

752
00:51:36,875 --> 00:51:37,999
Look around.

753
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,832
Anyone else at the beach wearing shoes
besides you, me and him?

754
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:43,583
And we're all working something.

755
00:51:50,916 --> 00:51:52,749
Ah.

756
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:54,332
He's a Karmanian Death Merc.

757
00:51:54,333 --> 00:51:57,374
So is that guy and that guy.

758
00:51:57,375 --> 00:52:00,082
You can tell by the tattoos
on their hands.

759
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:02,624
This is all fascinating. How about we find
the guy we're actually looking for?

760
00:52:02,625 --> 00:52:05,458
That's the guy we're looking for.

761
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:08,707
The Karmanians are his security detail.

762
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:10,540
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

763
00:52:10,541 --> 00:52:12,665
We'll have a few drinks, paint some nails.

764
00:52:12,666 --> 00:52:13,957
We'll see where the afternoon takes us.

765
00:52:13,958 --> 00:52:15,207
Hey, wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

766
00:52:15,208 --> 00:52:16,999
- What are you doing?
- Going to talk to him.

767
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,790
No. No. We got to go in sideways here.

768
00:52:19,791 --> 00:52:21,540
Remember when I said
they're called Death Mercs?

769
00:52:21,541 --> 00:52:23,332
We'll be fine.

770
00:52:33,166 --> 00:52:34,374
Keep walking.

771
00:52:34,375 --> 00:52:36,249
I need to talk to him now.

772
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:37,832
Keep walking.

773
00:52:37,833 --> 00:52:39,415
I'm gonna count to five.

774
00:52:39,416 --> 00:52:41,832
Then what?

775
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:43,666
- Then you're gonna get hurt.
- Oh.

776
00:52:48,375 --> 00:52:50,874
Listen, dickhead. It's Christmas.

777
00:52:50,875 --> 00:52:53,708
So in the yuletide spirit,
I'm gonna say it one more time.

778
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:20,791
That was... so disturbing.

779
00:53:21,875 --> 00:53:24,374
- What's this?
- What the hell, Ted?

780
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:25,832
Just give me a minute, sweetheart.

781
00:53:25,833 --> 00:53:29,124
I got to talk to these absolute morons
for a second,

782
00:53:29,125 --> 00:53:31,124
and then we'll go get some boba.

783
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:32,999
Okay.

784
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,665
- Where is he?
- Who?

785
00:53:34,666 --> 00:53:36,665
- You know who.
- You really want to do this?

786
00:53:36,666 --> 00:53:38,999
Uh, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

787
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:44,540
And while I'm enjoying this visit from,
uh, the <i>Magic Mike</i> Christmas brigade,

788
00:53:44,541 --> 00:53:46,249
I got a couple ladies
waiting on boba teas.

789
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:49,124
- Okay. Hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait.
-  I'm playing, big boy. Come on.

790
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:52,582
Before you implode this man's skull
across this heavenly beach,

791
00:53:52,583 --> 00:53:55,374
- can I have a crack at it?
-  Look, I'm telling you,

792
00:53:55,375 --> 00:53:59,915
for your own health and well-being,
I suggest you leave right now.

793
00:53:59,916 --> 00:54:01,915
You don't know who I know.

794
00:54:01,916 --> 00:54:04,540
All right. Well, you know what I know?

795
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:06,540
I know you bought
some information yesterday

796
00:54:06,541 --> 00:54:09,082
and you paid quite a bit for it.

797
00:54:09,083 --> 00:54:11,125
Coordinates, the arctic.

798
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:15,250
I know this 'cause I'm the one
who sold 'em to you.

799
00:54:16,708 --> 00:54:18,041
You...

800
00:54:20,666 --> 00:54:21,958
You're The Wolf?

801
00:54:23,041 --> 00:54:25,499
No. You should not be here.

802
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,915
Do you know what you've done
by coming here?

803
00:54:27,916 --> 00:54:29,790
My client is not to be messed with.

804
00:54:29,791 --> 00:54:31,790
Who's the client? New York?

805
00:54:31,791 --> 00:54:33,624
Much worse.

806
00:54:33,625 --> 00:54:35,790
She'll kill us. She'll kill us all.

807
00:54:35,791 --> 00:54:39,499
- Who is it?
- I can't say her name.

808
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,500
She will hear.

809
00:54:45,791 --> 00:54:49,540
Write her name in the sand.

810
00:54:57,125 --> 00:54:58,790
- "Gree-la"?
- You idiot.

811
00:54:58,791 --> 00:55:00,415
- "Gry-la"?
- No!

812
00:55:00,416 --> 00:55:02,500
<i>"Gree-la"?</i>

813
00:55:26,791 --> 00:55:29,416
Cal, Cal.

814
00:55:45,958 --> 00:55:47,832
Callum Drift,

815
00:55:47,833 --> 00:55:53,583
storied warrior of the North Pole.

816
00:55:54,791 --> 00:55:57,916
Gryla, the Christmas Witch.

817
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,832
It has been many years.

818
00:56:00,833 --> 00:56:02,957
Not enough.

819
00:56:02,958 --> 00:56:04,332
Where is he?

820
00:56:04,333 --> 00:56:08,041
He's right here, fast asleep.

821
00:56:10,041 --> 00:56:11,500
Signal from Commander Drift.

822
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:15,165
<i>Gryla,
where are you?</i>

823
00:56:15,166 --> 00:56:17,082
The Witch.

824
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:20,457
I need him back unharmed immediately.

825
00:56:20,458 --> 00:56:23,415
It is not to be, warrior!

826
00:56:23,416 --> 00:56:25,040
I need M-WAT teams in motion

827
00:56:25,041 --> 00:56:27,707
- to every one of her ancestral haunts.
- Yes, Director.

828
00:56:27,708 --> 00:56:29,249
What is it you want?

829
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:34,165
The same thing I have always wanted
for hundreds of years.

830
00:56:34,166 --> 00:56:37,040
To make them behave.

831
00:56:37,041 --> 00:56:39,207
The time has come...

832
00:56:39,208 --> 00:56:42,457
...to punish the naughty.

833
00:56:42,458 --> 00:56:44,124
All of them.

834
00:56:44,125 --> 00:56:46,915
Everyone who is on the list.

835
00:56:46,916 --> 00:56:49,540
Everyone who has ever been

836
00:56:49,541 --> 00:56:50,999
<i>on the list.</i>

837
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,290
From killers to jaywalkers.

838
00:56:54,291 --> 00:56:57,415
Anyone who's ever lied or littered.

839
00:56:57,416 --> 00:57:00,665
Anyone who's ever been rude or late.

840
00:57:00,666 --> 00:57:04,082
You're talking about almost everyone.

841
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:06,707
Everyone I see fit.

842
00:57:06,708 --> 00:57:09,582
Tomorrow they will all be punished.

843
00:57:09,583 --> 00:57:14,707
And he is going to help.

844
00:57:14,708 --> 00:57:16,790
You know he doesn't punish people.

845
00:57:16,791 --> 00:57:19,832
Step away, warrior.

846
00:57:19,833 --> 00:57:21,415
Let him go, Witch.

847
00:57:21,416 --> 00:57:22,791
I've warned you.

848
00:57:23,875 --> 00:57:25,249
And I've warned you.

849
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:27,415
You can't see it yet,

850
00:57:27,416 --> 00:57:31,165
but when you wake up
this Christmas morning,

851
00:57:31,166 --> 00:57:35,291
the world will be much, much...

852
00:57:36,458 --> 00:57:38,125
...nicer.

853
00:57:42,916 --> 00:57:44,790
What in the actual fu--

854
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:48,040
Get those teams moving now.

855
00:57:49,625 --> 00:57:51,707
What the hell was that?

856
00:57:51,708 --> 00:57:53,874
What was that? What the hell was that?

857
00:57:53,875 --> 00:57:55,540
- Where is she?
- We got to get out of here.

858
00:57:55,541 --> 00:57:56,624
-  Where is she?
-  I don't know.

859
00:57:56,625 --> 00:57:58,457
I'm just a middleman. I brokered the deal.

860
00:57:58,458 --> 00:58:01,666
- I'm telling you,
she does not mess around.
- Cal. Cal.

861
00:58:54,708 --> 00:58:56,125
Snowmen.

862
00:59:09,916 --> 00:59:10,957
No.

863
00:59:10,958 --> 00:59:13,332
Get him out of here. He's our only lead.
Don't let him get iced.

864
00:59:13,333 --> 00:59:14,707
All right.

865
00:59:18,166 --> 00:59:19,416
Come on.

866
00:59:23,875 --> 00:59:26,041
Go. Go.

867
01:02:07,125 --> 01:02:08,916
Just got to rip off their carrots.

868
01:02:09,916 --> 01:02:12,458
I'll remember that next time it comes up.

869
01:02:14,083 --> 01:02:15,499
Want to give me a hand here?

870
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:16,915
You'll figure it out.

871
01:02:20,666 --> 01:02:26,374
<i>♪ Let me tell you about Christmas magic...</i>

872
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:28,665
I'm sorry, I think you're confusing me
with someone who cares!

873
01:02:28,666 --> 01:02:30,957
Tell Grandma I don't have time
to pick up her meds.

874
01:02:30,958 --> 01:02:33,165
She can take the bus.

875
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:35,082
Goodbye.

876
01:02:35,083 --> 01:02:36,291
Asshole.

877
01:02:37,458 --> 01:02:39,040

<i>♪ With the angels singing...</i>

884
01:03:11,625 --> 01:03:13,165
It's still here.

885
01:03:13,166 --> 01:03:15,707
What do you mean it's still there?

886
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:18,124
It's supposed to come back to me.

887
01:03:18,125 --> 01:03:20,875
The machine isn't working. Fix it.

888
01:03:22,041 --> 01:03:25,041
Now, or else the next test
will be on one of you.

889
01:03:26,416 --> 01:03:28,082
Yes, Mum.

890
01:03:30,541 --> 01:03:32,500
Careful.

891
01:03:34,333 --> 01:03:35,958
That's it.

892
01:03:38,166 --> 01:03:39,749
She iced the broker.

893
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:41,415
She really wanted to shut him up.

894
01:03:41,416 --> 01:03:44,165
By the time he thaws out,
he'll be useless to us.

895
01:03:44,166 --> 01:03:46,124
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

896
01:03:46,125 --> 01:03:48,957
My guys scanned all the surveillance
footage from the Pole last night.

897
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:50,916
Look at this.

898
01:03:53,375 --> 01:03:55,332
- That her?
-  Sort of.

899
01:03:55,333 --> 01:03:57,165
She's a shape-shifter.

900
01:03:57,166 --> 01:04:00,582
She's actually a 900-year-old ogre
with 13 sons who kill on command.

901
01:04:00,583 --> 01:04:02,207
Huh.

902
01:04:02,208 --> 01:04:05,207
Tracking shape-shifters
is a nightmare.

903
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:08,249
She said that she was gonna
punish them all, every level.

904
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:10,290
I'd be more worried
about what she didn't say.

905
01:04:10,291 --> 01:04:12,290
She wasn't negotiating.

906
01:04:12,291 --> 01:04:13,957
It's a kidnapping with no demands.

907
01:04:13,958 --> 01:04:15,207
Doesn't usually end well.

908
01:04:15,208 --> 01:04:18,749
Unfortunately, our only lead
is now an ice cube.

909
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:20,500
Not pointing any fingers.

910
01:04:21,541 --> 01:04:23,249
- Cal, not helpful.
-  Yeah, Cal.

911
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:24,708
Not helpful.

912
01:04:26,416 --> 01:04:28,165
So, what would you normally do?

913
01:04:29,625 --> 01:04:32,582
I mean, normally,
I'd be running credit cards,

914
01:04:32,583 --> 01:04:34,332
checking pings off cell phone towers,

915
01:04:34,333 --> 01:04:36,957
trying to build a footprint--
her, her associates.

916
01:04:36,958 --> 01:04:39,332
Never tracked a witch before.

917
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:40,749
Dated a few.

918
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:41,957
Right, Cal?

919
01:04:41,958 --> 01:04:44,291
I've dated several witches.
What's your point?

920
01:04:45,375 --> 01:04:47,124
Would she have any footprint
that I wouldn't know about

921
01:04:47,125 --> 01:04:49,999
because I'm, like, a regular human being?

922
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,250
Have you run a check on recent UDMs?

923
01:04:53,375 --> 01:04:56,624
- What's that?
- Unauthorized deployments of magic.

924
01:04:58,541 --> 01:05:00,832
Lot of hits. Pretty typical stuff.

925
01:05:00,833 --> 01:05:03,832
Couple of abjurations in Nairobi.

926
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:06,332
Handful of divinations
in Santiago and New Orleans.

927
01:05:06,333 --> 01:05:07,707
No, she's a conjurer.

928
01:05:07,708 --> 01:05:12,165
Got a pair of conjurations
eight days ago, few hours apart.

929
01:05:12,166 --> 01:05:15,165
Picked up the echo
off the resonator in Germany.

930
01:05:15,166 --> 01:05:16,250
The brother.

931
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:19,082
- Whose brother?
- Nick's.

932
01:05:19,083 --> 01:05:21,333
- Santa's got a brother?
- Adopted, yes.

933
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:23,540
She's working with the brother.

934
01:05:23,541 --> 01:05:24,874
We don't know that.

935
01:05:24,875 --> 01:05:26,665
No, but can you think
of a better place to hold Nick?

936
01:05:26,666 --> 01:05:28,999
Think about it.
It's under a concealment dome,

937
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,915
and MORA has no jurisdiction
because of the treaty.

938
01:05:30,916 --> 01:05:33,374
He doesn't leave, and we don't visit.
That's the deal.

939
01:05:33,375 --> 01:05:35,457
We bust in and Nick's not there--

940
01:05:35,458 --> 01:05:36,707
MORA's not going. We're going.

941
01:05:36,708 --> 01:05:38,082
And he's never gonna know we're there.

942
01:05:38,083 --> 01:05:40,374
- Cal--
- T minus 17 hours, Director.

943
01:05:45,833 --> 01:05:47,874
Keep me in the loop every step.

944
01:05:47,875 --> 01:05:50,457
In two hours, I brief the presidents
and prime ministers

945
01:05:50,458 --> 01:05:53,374
and kings and queens of everywhere
so they can prepare.

946
01:05:53,375 --> 01:05:55,166
Prepare for what?

947
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:58,125
For the possibility of no Christmas.

948
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:08,332
Hey. You don't have a Wonder Woman
action figure, do you?

949
01:06:08,333 --> 01:06:10,207
That's not how it works. Come on.

950
01:06:10,208 --> 01:06:12,166
Ah, damn it.

951
01:06:14,458 --> 01:06:17,040
- Come on.
-  I'm coming.

952
01:06:32,125 --> 01:06:35,250
I can't believe
they're out of essential oils!

953
01:06:41,458 --> 01:06:42,790
Hey.

954
01:06:42,791 --> 01:06:45,624
Dylan asked you to go
to his concert tonight and you said no?

955
01:06:45,625 --> 01:06:47,999
What? No, that's not what happened.

956
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,665
He actually said I shouldn't go.
He said it was gonna be lame.

957
01:06:50,666 --> 01:06:52,415
If he didn't want you to go,

958
01:06:52,416 --> 01:06:53,665
<i>he wouldn't have brought it up.</i>

959
01:06:53,666 --> 01:06:55,874
<i>An actual parent
doesn't need an invitation.</i>

960
01:06:55,875 --> 01:06:58,290
They just go,
whether the kid likes it or not.

961
01:06:58,291 --> 01:07:01,249
<i>That's what parents do.</i>

962
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:03,540
Well, we both know
that's not my strong suit, Olivia.

963
01:07:03,541 --> 01:07:06,207
Look, if he wanted me to go,
he should've just asked me.

964
01:07:06,208 --> 01:07:07,707
He's vulnerable, Jack.

965
01:07:07,708 --> 01:07:10,540
He's a kid, and he knows
you never show up.

966
01:07:10,541 --> 01:07:13,165
Olivia, I'm in... I'm at work.

967
01:07:13,166 --> 01:07:14,707
What am I supposed to do?

968
01:07:14,708 --> 01:07:16,457
I don't want to have to tell you
what to do, Jack.

969
01:07:16,458 --> 01:07:19,124
I want you to figure it out on your own,
because it's pretty easy.

970
01:07:19,125 --> 01:07:20,707
The concert starts at 7:00.

971
01:07:20,708 --> 01:07:22,582
Well, I'm not gonna be home by 7:00.
Just tell Dylan that I--

972
01:07:22,583 --> 01:07:23,832
<i>I'm not telling him anything.</i>

973
01:07:23,833 --> 01:07:26,082
If you want to tell him something,
do it yourself.

974
01:07:29,833 --> 01:07:31,249
What?

975
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:33,541
I didn't say anything.

976
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,791
Dylan, right?

977
01:07:58,458 --> 01:07:59,875
Yeah.

978
01:08:01,083 --> 01:08:02,499
He's a good kid.

979
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,875
Yeah, I know he's a good kid.

980
01:08:13,833 --> 01:08:17,207
It's not what you think.
His mother and I were never together.

981
01:08:17,208 --> 01:08:19,541
I mean, I'm his father,
but I've never been his dad.

982
01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:24,374
She's a doctor now,
and she's married to a really good guy,

983
01:08:24,375 --> 01:08:28,415
and he is a good dad,
so the last thing the kid needs is, like,

984
01:08:28,416 --> 01:08:31,290
you know, some spare dad
who's a degenerate gambler

985
01:08:31,291 --> 01:08:34,416
hanging out with the scum of the earth,
who's got nothing to offer him, so...

986
01:08:36,333 --> 01:08:38,832
Honestly, the best thing I can do
for the kid is keep some distance

987
01:08:38,833 --> 01:08:42,124
so I don't get in the way
and he's not disappointed all the time.

988
01:08:42,125 --> 01:08:43,583
Uh-huh.

989
01:08:44,916 --> 01:08:46,290
"Uh-huh," what?

990
01:08:46,291 --> 01:08:50,166
I'm just saying,
if you're trying not to disappoint him...

991
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,500
...doesn't sound like it's working.

992
01:09:20,708 --> 01:09:23,624
<i>Okay. I can't believe
I'm asking this, but...</i>

993
01:09:23,625 --> 01:09:26,375
what's the deal with Santa
and his brother?

994
01:09:32,041 --> 01:09:34,332
They used to work together...

995
01:09:34,333 --> 01:09:35,874
back in the beginning.

996
01:09:35,875 --> 01:09:38,915
Red gave gifts to well-behaved children,

997
01:09:38,916 --> 01:09:41,499
and the brother helped keep track
of who they were.

998
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:44,582
Then the brother started making lists.

999
01:09:44,583 --> 01:09:47,290
And Red was always
uncomfortable with that.

1000
01:09:47,291 --> 01:09:50,833
He didn't like the idea of a running list
of misbehaved children.

1001
01:09:51,958 --> 01:09:54,291
But the brother became obsessed.

1002
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:59,707
So you're saying Santa's brother
started the Naughty List?

1003
01:09:59,708 --> 01:10:01,832
Yes.

1004
01:10:01,833 --> 01:10:04,374
And he started to punish
the kids who were on it.

1005
01:10:04,375 --> 01:10:07,749
Red was furious.

1006
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:12,624
So he took the list away,
and the brother never forgave him.

1007
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:15,624
He went out on his own,
eventually hooking up with the Witch,

1008
01:10:15,625 --> 01:10:18,540
who was also in the punishment game,

1009
01:10:18,541 --> 01:10:22,041
working Iceland
and several other Nordic territories.

1010
01:10:23,291 --> 01:10:26,791
They were together for years,
but it ended badly.

1011
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:31,958
Santa's brother have a name,
or is it just "Santa's brother"?

1012
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:36,499
His name is Krampus.

1013
01:10:41,291 --> 01:10:44,082
All right, listen to me. I don't know
what's waiting for us in here,

1014
01:10:44,083 --> 01:10:45,499
but the brother, the Witch,

1015
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:48,207
they're extremely dangerous,
and not in the ways that you're used to.

1016
01:10:48,208 --> 01:10:50,040
If you see them, do not engage.

1017
01:10:50,041 --> 01:10:51,790
So don't pick a fight with the Witch.

1018
01:10:51,791 --> 01:10:52,874
Got it.

1019
01:10:52,875 --> 01:10:55,415
If Nick is here, he's probably
being held in the dungeon.

1020
01:10:55,416 --> 01:10:57,249
There's a door around back
that the guards use.

1021
01:10:57,250 --> 01:10:59,040
We're gonna have to quietly sneak
through the courtyard,

1022
01:10:59,041 --> 01:11:00,957
past the guillotines,
break in and head down.

1023
01:11:00,958 --> 01:11:02,040
The guillotines?

1024
01:11:02,041 --> 01:11:05,082
Also, do not touch anything
under any circumstances.

1025
01:11:05,083 --> 01:11:07,749
There is much in here
that is not of the natural world.

1026
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:09,707
You're human, therefore weak.

1027
01:11:09,708 --> 01:11:12,541
So, if you need to touch anything,
get me to do it.

1028
01:11:14,125 --> 01:11:16,999
Wait a minute. Are you not human?

1029
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,874
Do I look human?

1030
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:03,582
Hey. So listen, man.

1031
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:07,082
I think, if you don't need me here,
I might just go back to the car.

1032
01:12:07,083 --> 01:12:08,458
Shh.

1033
01:12:13,791 --> 01:12:16,583
- Hellhounds.
- Hellhounds?

1034
01:12:24,666 --> 01:12:25,666
Stand back.

1035
01:12:31,625 --> 01:12:33,832
Ellen, distract them.

1036
01:13:12,416 --> 01:13:14,415
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah.

1037
01:13:14,416 --> 01:13:15,874
Ooh, ooh, cha, cha.

1038
01:13:15,875 --> 01:13:18,124
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah.

1039
01:13:18,125 --> 01:13:20,124
Ooh, ooh, cha, cha...

1040
01:13:20,125 --> 01:13:21,249
What'd you do?

1041
01:13:21,250 --> 01:13:22,624
What do you mean what did I do?

1042
01:13:22,625 --> 01:13:23,999
I didn't do anything.

1043
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,832
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah. Ooh, ooh, cha, cha.

1044
01:13:27,833 --> 01:13:29,458
Thieves!

1045
01:13:30,958 --> 01:13:32,000
Holy shit.

1046
01:13:32,791 --> 01:13:35,040
Whoa, whoa.

1047
01:13:35,041 --> 01:13:36,290
Cal! Cal!

1048
01:13:36,291 --> 01:13:38,290
My name is Callum Drift,
commander of the E.L.F.

1049
01:13:38,291 --> 01:13:39,915
- We are not thieves.
-  Yeah, we're not thieves!

1050
01:13:39,916 --> 01:13:41,915
We're not thieves!

1051
01:13:41,916 --> 01:13:44,083
Oh!

1052
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:47,165
This was in his pocket.

1053
01:13:47,166 --> 01:13:48,499
All right, I can explain that.

1054
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,124
I can explain that.

1055
01:13:56,583 --> 01:13:58,957
I told you not to touch anything.

1056
01:13:58,958 --> 01:14:00,582
It was an innocent mistake.

1057
01:14:00,583 --> 01:14:04,082
You tried to steal a priceless piece
of gold from the Dark Lord of Winter.

1058
01:14:04,083 --> 01:14:06,707
Not innocent and not a mistake.

1059
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:09,582
Well, who leaves their gold just lying out
in an open treasure chest?

1060
01:14:09,583 --> 01:14:12,040
It's a tribute box to Krampus.

1061
01:14:12,041 --> 01:14:14,208
Guests come, they leave him gifts.
You stole from it.

1062
01:14:15,875 --> 01:14:17,791
I shouldn't be surprised.

1063
01:14:19,250 --> 01:14:21,499
Is that 'cause I happen to be on the list?

1064
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:23,749
You disappointed in me, too, Cal?

1065
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:27,875
I have no expectations of you, Jack,
so I can't be disappointed.

1066
01:14:34,708 --> 01:14:36,707
You know, I got problems of my own.

1067
01:14:36,708 --> 01:14:39,624
I owe somebody a lot of money
that I don't have.

1068
01:14:39,625 --> 01:14:42,749
I see this giant pile of gold
sitting there.

1069
01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:45,457
If you look at it a certain way,
what choice did I even have?

1070
01:14:45,458 --> 01:14:48,582
You have every choice. It's all choices.

1071
01:14:48,583 --> 01:14:50,707
You don't just happen
to be on the list, Jack.

1072
01:14:50,708 --> 01:14:53,332
You put yourself there.

1073
01:14:53,333 --> 01:14:55,374
You decide to steal gold.

1074
01:14:55,375 --> 01:14:59,540
You decide to only look out for yourself
over everyone else on this Earth.

1075
01:14:59,541 --> 01:15:02,791
Every one of those kids
who are counting on us.

1076
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:07,416
Counting on me to do my job.

1077
01:15:13,083 --> 01:15:19,208
Nick always says that every decision,
big or small, is an opportunity.

1078
01:15:21,291 --> 01:15:22,499
To be nice?

1079
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:24,707
To be good.

1080
01:15:24,708 --> 01:15:26,125
Or not.

1081
01:15:29,416 --> 01:15:32,082
I was one day away from retirement.

1082
01:15:32,083 --> 01:15:33,833
Then this happens.

1083
01:15:34,833 --> 01:15:37,666
After 542 years.

1084
01:15:40,166 --> 01:15:42,290
I resigned yesterday.

1085
01:15:42,291 --> 01:15:43,791
You did?

1086
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:47,000
Why?

1087
01:15:48,833 --> 01:15:50,500
I couldn't see it anymore.

1088
01:15:51,583 --> 01:15:52,833
Couldn't see what?

1089
01:15:57,083 --> 01:15:58,708
Doesn't matter.

1090
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:14,125
The third touch.

1091
01:16:20,291 --> 01:16:21,875
Is that him?

1092
01:16:31,208 --> 01:16:32,874
What are they doing?

1093
01:16:36,875 --> 01:16:39,166
They're playing Krampusschlap.

1094
01:16:40,541 --> 01:16:42,749
Krampusschlap?

1095
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:44,916
It's the official game of Krampusnacht.

1096
01:16:57,375 --> 01:17:02,790
Ever undefeated, Dread Lord Krampus!

1097
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:14,499
Callum Drift.

1098
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:16,000
Lord Krampus.

1099
01:17:17,083 --> 01:17:20,165
The festivities are just beginning,

1100
01:17:20,166 --> 01:17:22,916
but I don't remember inviting you.

1101
01:17:28,041 --> 01:17:31,165
You shouldn't be here.

1102
01:17:31,166 --> 01:17:33,665
You know you shouldn't be here,

1103
01:17:33,666 --> 01:17:36,374
and yet here you are.

1104
01:17:36,375 --> 01:17:38,166
And with a mortal.

1105
01:17:39,416 --> 01:17:41,290
Uh, I'm Jack O'Malley.

1106
01:17:41,291 --> 01:17:42,832
I didn't... I'm not...

1107
01:17:42,833 --> 01:17:45,332
We didn't even... I mean, obviously we...

1108
01:17:45,333 --> 01:17:47,040
I just met him today.

1109
01:17:47,041 --> 01:17:49,166
The big one was armed with this.

1110
01:17:50,250 --> 01:17:52,124
A Northern Vambrace.

1111
01:17:52,125 --> 01:17:53,582
Thank you.

1112
01:17:53,583 --> 01:17:57,124
Just what I wanted for Christmas.

1113
01:17:57,125 --> 01:17:59,332
Krampus, I can explain--

1114
01:17:59,333 --> 01:18:01,749
You're trying to find him,

1115
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:04,333
and you thought he would be here.

1116
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:07,583
Well, guess what, Northerner.

1117
01:18:11,166 --> 01:18:12,707
He's not here.

1118
01:18:14,833 --> 01:18:17,875
Last night, he was taken
from the compound by the Witch.

1119
01:18:19,041 --> 01:18:21,208
And I know that she was here not long ago.

1120
01:18:22,416 --> 01:18:25,665
Are you accusing me of something, Drift?

1121
01:18:25,666 --> 01:18:28,707
You and she were partners once.

1122
01:18:28,708 --> 01:18:31,665
Roaming the countryside, the villages.

1123
01:18:31,666 --> 01:18:33,165
Punishing people.

1124
01:18:33,166 --> 01:18:34,916
Yes.

1125
01:18:36,041 --> 01:18:37,665
But back then, she was glorious.

1126
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,165
An ogre 18 feet high.

1127
01:18:41,166 --> 01:18:43,332
The skin of an elephant.

1128
01:18:43,333 --> 01:18:46,625
Giant pair of tails.

1129
01:18:47,791 --> 01:18:52,040
And yes, punishing as the cruelest winter.

1130
01:18:52,041 --> 01:18:55,958
We had some wonderful times together.

1131
01:18:57,625 --> 01:18:59,707
But I gave up that work, remember?

1132
01:18:59,708 --> 01:19:04,999
I spent 700 years menacing the naughty,

1133
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,040
trying to scare them into decency.

1134
01:19:08,041 --> 01:19:10,000
I did my part!

1135
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:13,583
The only punishing I do now...

1136
01:19:15,541 --> 01:19:18,332
...is for fun.

1137
01:19:18,333 --> 01:19:20,249
Like my good friend over here...

1138
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:24,499
...enjoying his headache on Krampusnacht.

1139
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:26,290
But today is not Krampusnacht.

1140
01:19:26,291 --> 01:19:29,332
In this house, Northerner,

1141
01:19:29,333 --> 01:19:33,624
it is always Krampusnacht!

1142
01:19:33,625 --> 01:19:35,582
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah!
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah!

1143
01:19:35,583 --> 01:19:38,207
Ah, ah, ah! Ooh, ooh, ah, ah!

1144
01:19:38,208 --> 01:19:40,082
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah! Ah, ah, ah!

1145
01:19:40,083 --> 01:19:43,499
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah!
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah! Ah, ah, ah!

1146
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:45,832
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah! Ooh, ah, ooh, ah!

1147
01:19:45,833 --> 01:19:48,165
- Krampus!
- Ah, ah, ah! Ooh--

1148
01:19:49,250 --> 01:19:50,500
Why was she here?

1149
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:56,874
Many years ago, she gave me a gift.

1150
01:19:56,875 --> 01:19:59,165
She came because she wanted it back.

1151
01:19:59,166 --> 01:20:01,540
A gift? What gift?

1152
01:20:01,541 --> 01:20:03,790
The Glaskäfig.

1153
01:20:03,791 --> 01:20:07,457
On its face, a simple glass snow globe,

1154
01:20:07,458 --> 01:20:11,165
but its true purpose is nefarious.

1155
01:20:11,166 --> 01:20:12,999
Tremendously punishing.

1156
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:16,040
She wants to punish them all.

1157
01:20:16,041 --> 01:20:19,749
The Glaskäfig is solitude.

1158
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:22,125
A prison for but one.

1159
01:20:23,208 --> 01:20:24,791
Krampus, I need to find him.

1160
01:20:30,541 --> 01:20:31,750
Let me go.

1161
01:20:33,625 --> 01:20:36,082
And why...

1162
01:20:36,083 --> 01:20:38,166
would I do that?

1163
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,833
Because we need him.

1164
01:20:44,541 --> 01:20:46,541
Now more than ever, we need him.

1165
01:20:47,708 --> 01:20:49,041
And you know that.

1166
01:20:51,541 --> 01:20:53,166
Let me go.

1167
01:21:03,125 --> 01:21:05,124
Northerner.

1168
01:21:05,125 --> 01:21:07,500
You are not going anywhere.

1169
01:21:08,875 --> 01:21:11,540
You, get out.

1170
01:21:11,541 --> 01:21:14,207
And deliver this message
to that MORA scum.

1171
01:21:14,208 --> 01:21:17,582
There is a price for this intrusion.

1172
01:21:17,583 --> 01:21:20,874
Now and forever,

1173
01:21:20,875 --> 01:21:23,208
Drift belongs to me.

1174
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:28,707
So I can...

1175
01:21:28,708 --> 01:21:30,500
just walk out of here?

1176
01:21:31,666 --> 01:21:32,833
I suggest you run.

1177
01:21:36,250 --> 01:21:38,958
You'll learn to love it here.

1178
01:21:40,041 --> 01:21:41,707
Take him away.

1179
01:21:43,875 --> 01:21:47,415
Wait. Uh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Uh, sorry. Wait.

1180
01:21:47,416 --> 01:21:49,040
Um, uh, L-Lord... uh, Mister...

1181
01:21:49,041 --> 01:21:51,957
Lord Krampus, um...

1182
01:21:51,958 --> 01:21:53,541
you and I aren't so different.

1183
01:21:58,125 --> 01:22:00,999
We're pretty different, but I think
we have some things in common.

1184
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,415
Ah. Do you, now?

1185
01:22:03,416 --> 01:22:04,707
Yeah.

1186
01:22:04,708 --> 01:22:07,582
I mean, you strike me as a guy
that likes to have a good time.

1187
01:22:07,583 --> 01:22:08,874
Bit of a gambler?

1188
01:22:08,875 --> 01:22:10,374
Well, so am I.

1189
01:22:10,375 --> 01:22:14,832
Now, when we came in here, my man told me
that he thought he could beat you

1190
01:22:14,833 --> 01:22:17,832
at your game, uh, Krampusschlap.

1191
01:22:17,833 --> 01:22:19,832
What?

1192
01:22:19,833 --> 01:22:22,999
Now, initially, I said, "No way."

1193
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,832
But the more I see him getting riled up,
I'm starting to like my odds,

1194
01:22:25,833 --> 01:22:28,540
so just hear me out.

1195
01:22:28,541 --> 01:22:31,624
If you win, we go to your dungeon forever.

1196
01:22:31,625 --> 01:22:34,708
If he wins, we walk.

1197
01:22:35,791 --> 01:22:37,749
Unless you don't want to for some reason.

1198
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:39,582
I mean, I get that. He's a big guy.

1199
01:22:39,583 --> 01:22:41,249
No shame.

1200
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:42,625
Lot of people watching.

1201
01:22:48,125 --> 01:22:50,582
Imbeciles.

1202
01:22:50,583 --> 01:22:52,749
I love it.

1203
01:22:52,750 --> 01:22:54,457
- Oh.
-  Ooh, ooh, ah, ah!

1204
01:22:54,458 --> 01:22:56,499
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah! Ah, ah, ah!

1205
01:22:59,125 --> 01:23:01,957
{\an8}

1206
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,708
Smack the shit out of that goat.

1207
01:23:17,458 --> 01:23:20,290
The rules are as follows:

1208
01:23:20,291 --> 01:23:23,707
The contestants
will exchange blows in turn.

1209
01:23:23,708 --> 01:23:27,500
The first to be knocked out or die loses.

1210
01:23:33,041 --> 01:23:34,540
First touch.

1211
01:23:34,541 --> 01:23:36,249
That's you.

1212
01:23:47,875 --> 01:23:50,499
You know, I really wish there was
another way that we could do this.

1213
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:52,540
Come on.

1214
01:23:52,541 --> 01:23:54,416
I'm sure you do.

1215
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:57,915
He's still your brother.

1216
01:23:57,916 --> 01:23:59,625
And he never gave up on you.

1217
01:24:00,708 --> 01:24:02,040
What would you know about it?

1218
01:24:02,041 --> 01:24:03,958
I know him.

1219
01:24:07,541 --> 01:24:09,625
Take your best "schlap."

1220
01:24:25,583 --> 01:24:27,000
Interesting.

1221
01:24:28,416 --> 01:24:29,499
My turn.

1222
01:24:36,333 --> 01:24:38,582
I could be merciful

1223
01:24:38,583 --> 01:24:41,290
and kill him on the first touch.

1224
01:24:41,291 --> 01:24:44,499
But what fun would that be, huh?

1225
01:24:55,833 --> 01:24:57,249
Oh, my God.

1226
01:25:11,916 --> 01:25:13,749
Hey, buddy. You okay?

1227
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:15,749
He just slapped the shit out of me.

1228
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:17,124
Yeah, that was so embarrassing.

1229
01:25:17,125 --> 01:25:20,165
I love this game!

1230
01:25:20,166 --> 01:25:22,290
I can't... I can't beat him.
He's a winter demigod. I--

1231
01:25:22,291 --> 01:25:23,874
Just get up. Trust me.

1232
01:25:23,875 --> 01:25:25,875
I can't...

1233
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,250
Second touch.

1234
01:25:36,375 --> 01:25:38,124
Oh. Sorry.

1235
01:25:42,166 --> 01:25:44,541
Let me make it easier for you.

1236
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:49,832
Come on.

1237
01:25:53,333 --> 01:25:54,708
Come on.

1238
01:25:58,583 --> 01:25:59,874
Come on.

1239
01:26:20,125 --> 01:26:21,500
Cover us.

1240
01:27:05,833 --> 01:27:07,458
Ellen, come on!

1241
01:27:26,541 --> 01:27:28,499
I thought I had some shady friends.

1242
01:27:30,791 --> 01:27:32,457
I can't believe that worked.

1243
01:27:32,458 --> 01:27:34,832
Yeah, sorry about that.
It's all I could come up with.

1244
01:27:34,833 --> 01:27:36,415
No, it was great.

1245
01:27:36,416 --> 01:27:38,125
Oh.

1246
01:27:39,416 --> 01:27:40,832
I misjudged you.

1247
01:27:42,875 --> 01:27:45,749
Not what you'd expect
from a Class Four Naughty Lister, right?

1248
01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:47,040
Well, it's Level Four.

1249
01:27:47,041 --> 01:27:48,749
- Ah.
- But that's what I'm saying.

1250
01:27:48,750 --> 01:27:51,208
You could've left, but you didn't.

1251
01:27:52,750 --> 01:27:54,166
Thank you.

1252
01:27:55,458 --> 01:27:57,790
All right.

1253
01:27:57,791 --> 01:27:59,666
Should we go find your guy?

1254
01:28:00,750 --> 01:28:02,833
Let's save Christmas.

1255
01:28:04,583 --> 01:28:06,207
Right.

1256
01:28:06,208 --> 01:28:07,249
Say it.

1257
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:09,207
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. Say it.

1258
01:28:09,208 --> 01:28:10,624
- I don't want to.
- Let's save Christmas.

1259
01:28:10,625 --> 01:28:11,874
I'm not gonna say that.

1260
01:28:11,875 --> 01:28:15,707
I'm gonna need you to say,
"Let's save Christmas."

1261
01:28:15,708 --> 01:28:18,124
All right. God. Okay.

1262
01:28:18,125 --> 01:28:19,915
Let's save Christmas.

1263
01:28:19,916 --> 01:28:21,874
That was terrible.

1264
01:28:21,875 --> 01:28:23,124
Okay.

1265
01:28:23,125 --> 01:28:25,457
All right, all right.

1266
01:28:27,583 --> 01:28:29,457
Let's save Christmas.

1267
01:28:29,458 --> 01:28:31,332
- There it is.
- All right.

1268
01:28:31,333 --> 01:28:34,040
All right, so the, uh, snow globe,
what's the deal with that?

1269
01:28:34,041 --> 01:28:35,290
The "glossy pig"?

1270
01:28:35,291 --> 01:28:37,957
Glaskäfig. It's German for "glass cage."

1271
01:28:37,958 --> 01:28:39,249
Well, what do you think
Gryla's trying to do?

1272
01:28:39,250 --> 01:28:41,207
- Is there--
- Shh.

1273
01:28:41,208 --> 01:28:43,207
<i>...Gryla's trying...?</i>

1274
01:28:45,250 --> 01:28:47,041
We got to go.

1275
01:28:49,041 --> 01:28:50,665
Mum.

1276
01:28:50,666 --> 01:28:53,707
Ready for another test.

1277
01:28:53,708 --> 01:28:54,999
Good.

1278
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,457
The next name on the list?

1279
01:28:57,458 --> 01:28:59,915
No.

1280
01:28:59,916 --> 01:29:02,332
I have a better idea.

1281
01:29:04,458 --> 01:29:06,540
She said she wanted to punish them all.

1282
01:29:06,541 --> 01:29:08,582
It seems like the Glaskäfig
was just for one person.

1283
01:29:08,583 --> 01:29:13,082
Is it possible she can make more of 'em
with, like, witch magic or--

1284
01:29:13,083 --> 01:29:14,915
She would need billions of them.

1285
01:29:14,916 --> 01:29:17,458
She's immensely powerful,
but that's a big lift for a conjurer.

1286
01:29:18,541 --> 01:29:19,624
Okay.

1287
01:29:19,625 --> 01:29:22,499
I mean, honestly, the only place that has
that kind of manufacturing capacity--

1288
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:23,874
Look out!

1289
01:29:48,541 --> 01:29:50,750
This something that happens to you a lot?

1290
01:29:51,833 --> 01:29:55,374
Unexplained player piano
in the middle of a German highway.

1291
01:29:55,375 --> 01:29:57,833
No. This is rare.

1292
01:30:04,541 --> 01:30:05,957
It's for you.

1293
01:30:05,958 --> 01:30:08,499
Well, I'm not touching that thing.

1294
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:11,082
Just get back in the truck. We'll drive
right around the haunted piano.

1295
01:30:11,083 --> 01:30:13,665
We have to open it.

1296
01:30:13,666 --> 01:30:16,374
This... this is how it starts.

1297
01:30:16,375 --> 01:30:18,416
You're doing it.

1298
01:30:27,625 --> 01:30:31,166
Oh, see?

1299
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:36,999
Dylan.

1300
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:40,249
<i>Did you send me this stupid present
instead of coming to this thing?</i>

1301
01:30:40,250 --> 01:30:41,957
Wait, what?

1302
01:30:41,958 --> 01:30:43,999
Because if you don't want to come,
I don't care.

1303
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,082
I wanted to be there. I really did.

1304
01:30:46,083 --> 01:30:48,207
- Then something--
<i>- Just stop, okay?</i>

1305
01:30:48,208 --> 01:30:51,457
<i>You don't have to pretend
because my mom is guilt-tripping you.</i>

1306
01:30:51,458 --> 01:30:52,874
I'm not pretending.

1307
01:30:52,875 --> 01:30:55,165
<i>- I really want to find a way--</i>
- You never come to anything.

1308
01:30:55,166 --> 01:30:56,957
Yeah, I... I know.

1309
01:30:56,958 --> 01:30:58,290
- I know.
<i>- Whatever.</i>

1310
01:30:58,291 --> 01:31:01,665
<i>I got to go. Just don't send me
any more stupid gifts, okay?</i>

1311
01:31:01,666 --> 01:31:04,165
W-Wait, wait.
Dylan, what'd you mean by that?

1312
01:31:04,166 --> 01:31:05,332
<i>This thing.</i>

1313
01:31:07,041 --> 01:31:09,290
- Dylan, don't touch that. Wait.
- No, don't.

1314
01:31:09,291 --> 01:31:11,165
Do you seriously think
that there's anything--

1315
01:31:11,166 --> 01:31:12,832
Dylan, listen to me. Put that down.

1316
01:31:12,833 --> 01:31:14,749
<i>Because I'm here to tell you that--</i>

1317
01:31:14,750 --> 01:31:16,165
What is this?

1318
01:31:16,166 --> 01:31:17,458
What's going on?

1319
01:31:21,666 --> 01:31:22,957
What's happening?

1320
01:31:22,958 --> 01:31:25,125
Put that down!

1321
01:31:26,541 --> 01:31:28,582
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?

1322
01:31:28,583 --> 01:31:29,875
I don't know.

1323
01:31:34,333 --> 01:31:36,166
Jack.

1324
01:31:38,458 --> 01:31:39,708
It's my kid.

1325
01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:42,707
Find me.

1326
01:31:54,375 --> 01:31:56,999
Dad?

1327
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,082
- Dad! What's going on?
- Dylan.

1328
01:31:59,083 --> 01:32:00,375
Where are we?

1329
01:32:03,291 --> 01:32:04,624
Oh, my God.

1330
01:32:06,125 --> 01:32:07,750
Oh, my God.

1331
01:32:10,750 --> 01:32:12,040
It worked.

1332
01:32:16,125 --> 01:32:19,207
Mm. Jack O'Malley.

1333
01:32:19,208 --> 01:32:21,290
Level Four.

1334
01:32:21,291 --> 01:32:24,582
What a perfect way to start my collection.

1335
01:32:24,583 --> 01:32:27,416
Bring production online.

1336
01:32:46,958 --> 01:32:52,415
Tonight, I will deliver one of these
to every single deviant on the list.

1337
01:32:52,416 --> 01:32:55,499
And when they wake up and open their gift,

1338
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:57,582
they'll join my collection,

1339
01:32:57,583 --> 01:33:01,582
and the world will be
in the hands of the righteous.

1340
01:33:01,583 --> 01:33:02,833
Finally.

1341
01:33:03,916 --> 01:33:07,083
Tonight, I make the ride.

1342
01:33:10,375 --> 01:33:11,457
Director, we have Drift.

1343
01:33:11,458 --> 01:33:12,790
What happened?

1344
01:33:12,791 --> 01:33:14,415
What do you know about the Glaskäfig?

1345
01:33:14,416 --> 01:33:16,790
Mythical magic snow globe
used to imprison the naughty.

1346
01:33:16,791 --> 01:33:18,290
Krampus has it. Why?

1347
01:33:18,291 --> 01:33:20,290
Not anymore. The Witch has it.

1348
01:33:20,291 --> 01:33:21,874
<i>And I think she's trying
to punish everyone on the list.</i>

1349
01:33:21,875 --> 01:33:22,957
Wait. Slow down.

1350
01:33:22,958 --> 01:33:24,374
O'Malley just got globed

1351
01:33:24,375 --> 01:33:26,249
<i>- and disappeared.</i>
- What?

1352
01:33:26,250 --> 01:33:27,457
His kid, too.

1353
01:33:27,458 --> 01:33:29,249
Oh, dear Lord.

1354
01:33:29,250 --> 01:33:31,416
<i>- Run O'Malley's tag.</i>
-  <i>Yes, Director.</i>

1355
01:33:33,125 --> 01:33:36,207
Zoe, I think she's trying
to mass-produce the Glaskäfig.

1356
01:33:36,208 --> 01:33:37,999
<i>- How could she possibly do that?</i>
- Think about it.

1357
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,707
<i>What's the one place that's capable
of something like that?</i>

1358
01:33:40,708 --> 01:33:42,082
The North Pole?

1359
01:33:42,083 --> 01:33:44,207
But Nick's not there.
The complex runs on his power.

1360
01:33:44,208 --> 01:33:46,249
That can't be it.

1361
01:33:46,250 --> 01:33:48,582
- Unless--
<i>- Unless he never left.</i>

1362
01:33:48,583 --> 01:33:52,625
- But the snowcat, the jet.
<i>- Drones, diversions.</i>

1363
01:33:54,458 --> 01:33:55,874
Nick is still there.

1364
01:33:55,875 --> 01:33:59,583
Director, I am not picking up
a signal for O'Malley's tracker.

1365
01:34:01,625 --> 01:34:03,624
Because he's under the dome.

1366
01:34:03,625 --> 01:34:05,874
<i>But I've been talking
to your team all night.</i>

1367
01:34:05,875 --> 01:34:07,791
You have?

1368
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:12,915
<i>Try Partridge.</i>

1369
01:34:12,916 --> 01:34:15,166
- Connect to Partridge.
- Yes, Director.

1370
01:34:17,208 --> 01:34:19,999
<i>- Hi. Cal.
- Hey. How you holding up, MC?</i>

1371
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,457
Well, I can't sleep.

1372
01:34:21,458 --> 01:34:25,040
I'm just keeping myself busy
baking cookies for him.

1373
01:34:25,041 --> 01:34:26,457
For when he comes home.

1374
01:34:26,458 --> 01:34:27,999
Well, he's gonna love that.

1375
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,290
What do you got baking?

1376
01:34:29,291 --> 01:34:33,291
Just pulled out
a fresh batch of macaroons.

1377
01:34:35,916 --> 01:34:37,333
He'll love that.

1378
01:34:38,416 --> 01:34:40,582
Hang in. I'll keep you posted.

1379
01:34:40,583 --> 01:34:42,500
<i>Thanks.</i>

1380
01:34:44,083 --> 01:34:45,374
That's not her.

1381
01:34:45,375 --> 01:34:46,665
What do you mean?

1382
01:34:46,666 --> 01:34:48,208
<i>Nick hates macaroons.</i>

1383
01:34:49,833 --> 01:34:51,457
They're shape-shifters.

1384
01:34:51,458 --> 01:34:52,957
<i>The Witch, the Lads.</i>

1385
01:34:52,958 --> 01:34:54,666
They're all shape-shifters.

1386
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,499
The North Pole has been taken.

1387
01:35:05,125 --> 01:35:07,082
They're onto us.

1388
01:35:07,083 --> 01:35:08,707
Where are we?

1389
01:35:08,708 --> 01:35:11,665
- What's happening?
- Okay, okay, okay, okay. Now, listen.

1390
01:35:11,666 --> 01:35:15,207
Now, I know
what this is gonna sound like.

1391
01:35:15,208 --> 01:35:17,708
Basically...

1392
01:35:19,916 --> 01:35:25,374
...Santa is missing,
and that giant lady is a witch,

1393
01:35:25,375 --> 01:35:30,249
and she got the snow globes
from a giant demonic Christmas...

1394
01:35:30,250 --> 01:35:31,749
goat man.

1395
01:35:31,750 --> 01:35:33,707
And now they're gonna make
millions of them

1396
01:35:33,708 --> 01:35:37,165
with that magical photocopier thing.

1397
01:35:37,166 --> 01:35:39,290
Look, I don't have
all the technical details,

1398
01:35:39,291 --> 01:35:44,665
but basically, these globes are meant
to imprison the naughty people forever.

1399
01:35:44,666 --> 01:35:46,875
Forever?

1400
01:35:47,958 --> 01:35:49,957
Not forever. I didn't...
Scratch that last part.

1401
01:35:56,083 --> 01:35:58,875
Remember, can't trust anyone.

1402
01:36:00,208 --> 01:36:02,082
I've got a signal.

1403
01:36:02,083 --> 01:36:04,041
O'Malley is here somewhere.

1404
01:36:07,625 --> 01:36:09,875
- We're close.
-  Hey, chief.

1405
01:36:11,375 --> 01:36:12,958
Fred?

1406
01:36:14,583 --> 01:36:17,166
- I'll let the team know that you're back.
- How about you don't?

1407
01:36:22,083 --> 01:36:23,500
Shape-shifters.

1408
01:36:24,583 --> 01:36:26,165
Good tidings.

1409
01:36:31,416 --> 01:36:34,041
It says he should be right here.

1410
01:36:38,041 --> 01:36:39,416
The old tunnel system.

1411
01:36:40,583 --> 01:36:42,041
Runs right beneath the original workshop.

1412
01:36:43,125 --> 01:36:44,124
Let's go.

1413
01:36:45,916 --> 01:36:47,582
Is this happening because I was ditching?

1414
01:36:47,583 --> 01:36:48,707
What?

1415
01:36:48,708 --> 01:36:50,040
Is it because I slashed Kevin's tires?

1416
01:36:50,041 --> 01:36:52,207
No, no, no, no, no, no, Dylan.

1417
01:36:52,208 --> 01:36:53,624
You said it was for naughty people,
didn't you?

1418
01:36:53,625 --> 01:36:55,082
Well, she said that, but--

1419
01:36:55,083 --> 01:36:56,790
- What did I do?
- Dylan.

1420
01:36:56,791 --> 01:36:58,291
Look at me.

1421
01:36:59,583 --> 01:37:02,582
You may have done some things
that you shouldn't have.

1422
01:37:02,583 --> 01:37:05,708
Everybody does. Everybody.
There is nothing wrong with you.

1423
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:09,999
You're only in here be...

1424
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,916
because of me.

1425
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:14,707
What did you do?

1426
01:37:14,708 --> 01:37:17,207
Mm. Lot of stuff.

1427
01:37:17,208 --> 01:37:19,625
It's... long list.

1428
01:37:21,333 --> 01:37:23,957
But bigger than any of that,
it's what I didn't do.

1429
01:37:23,958 --> 01:37:25,875
What are you talking about?

1430
01:37:32,583 --> 01:37:34,208
I've been a terrible father.

1431
01:37:36,125 --> 01:37:38,874
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is. It is.

1432
01:37:38,875 --> 01:37:40,582
I haven't been around.

1433
01:37:40,583 --> 01:37:43,624
I told myself I was doing you a favor,
which is bullshit.

1434
01:37:43,625 --> 01:37:47,166
It was bad for you,
and it was terrible for me.

1435
01:37:48,250 --> 01:37:51,332
I've made some mistakes, pal. I know that.

1436
01:37:51,333 --> 01:37:53,750
But I also know that I can do better.

1437
01:37:54,875 --> 01:37:56,957
And I know that's easier said than done.

1438
01:37:56,958 --> 01:38:00,625
I know it's a lot of work,
and I hope it's not too late.

1439
01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:08,791
Every day,
every decision is an opportunity.

1440
01:38:11,666 --> 01:38:13,500
And I want to start taking some of those.

1441
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,957
So I'm not asking you to believe me.

1442
01:38:16,958 --> 01:38:20,625
I'm just asking for you to...
give me a chance.

1443
01:38:22,041 --> 01:38:24,540
I know I may never be
the greatest father in the world,

1444
01:38:24,541 --> 01:38:27,290
but I know I can do better,

1445
01:38:27,291 --> 01:38:30,832
and I'm telling you right now
that I promise

1446
01:38:30,833 --> 01:38:33,124
I will never stop trying.

1447
01:38:59,125 --> 01:39:01,208
What just happened?

1448
01:39:04,916 --> 01:39:07,000
I think I just got a little bit nicer.

1449
01:39:08,125 --> 01:39:10,540
- Can we get out of here?
- Yeah.

1450
01:39:10,541 --> 01:39:13,332
First, we got to find somebody. Come on.

1451
01:39:22,250 --> 01:39:23,332
Ow.

1452
01:39:23,333 --> 01:39:25,291
Cal.

1453
01:39:26,833 --> 01:39:30,000
If you could make any toy in the world
real right now, what would it be?

1454
01:39:31,375 --> 01:39:32,749
Wonder Woman.

1455
01:39:32,750 --> 01:39:33,999
It's him.

1456
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,249
You all right?

1457
01:39:35,250 --> 01:39:37,374
Yeah. Yeah.

1458
01:39:37,375 --> 01:39:38,915
It's good to see you.

1459
01:39:38,916 --> 01:39:40,916
Dad?

1460
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,290
Buddy, come here.

1461
01:39:43,291 --> 01:39:44,790
I want you to meet some friends.

1462
01:39:44,791 --> 01:39:47,957
Cal, Zoe, this is my son Dylan.

1463
01:39:47,958 --> 01:39:49,832
The one and only Dylan.

1464
01:39:49,833 --> 01:39:51,250
Your dad's told me so much about you.

1465
01:39:53,416 --> 01:39:54,915
Welcome to the North Pole.

1466
01:39:54,916 --> 01:39:57,249
Huh?

1467
01:39:57,250 --> 01:39:59,999
I can't believe she got
the old Quatuplicator back online again.

1468
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,832
This thing has been out of commission
since the late 1800s.

1469
01:40:01,833 --> 01:40:04,249
This thing was cranking out snow globes
like rat turds,

1470
01:40:04,250 --> 01:40:06,249
and it just stopped
like somebody pulled the plug.

1471
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:07,415
Cal, we saw her.

1472
01:40:07,416 --> 01:40:09,499
She said she was
gonna do the ride herself.

1473
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:11,374
- What?
- Deliver one of these snow globes

1474
01:40:11,375 --> 01:40:12,540
to everybody on the list.

1475
01:40:12,541 --> 01:40:15,290
That's impossible.
The sleigh won't lift off.

1476
01:40:15,291 --> 01:40:16,540
Without him.

1477
01:40:16,541 --> 01:40:18,125
We can't let that sleigh take off.

1478
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,749
There's a subterranean access point
to the hangar.

1479
01:40:23,333 --> 01:40:24,500
Wait.

1480
01:40:32,333 --> 01:40:33,499
Chief.

1481
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:34,832
Garcia.

1482
01:40:34,833 --> 01:40:36,125
Cal.

1483
01:40:39,208 --> 01:40:40,750
Ma'am.

1484
01:40:41,833 --> 01:40:43,499
Where is he?

1485
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,333
Gryla, stop!

1486
01:41:24,541 --> 01:41:26,290
I was just leaving.

1487
01:41:27,958 --> 01:41:29,791
- Go. Take him.
- Come with me, Dylan. Got him.

1488
01:41:46,625 --> 01:41:48,540
Come on!

1489
01:41:48,541 --> 01:41:49,625
Go!

1490
01:43:15,291 --> 01:43:16,333
Hyah!

1491
01:44:19,166 --> 01:44:20,665
Nick.

1492
01:44:20,666 --> 01:44:22,750
Come on, Red. I got you.

1493
01:44:32,666 --> 01:44:34,540
Red?

1494
01:44:34,541 --> 01:44:37,207
Come back to me. Come back to me, boss.

1495
01:44:37,208 --> 01:44:38,833
Wake up.

1496
01:44:41,791 --> 01:44:43,790
Nick? Nick!

1497
01:44:43,791 --> 01:44:45,707
It's Cal.

1498
01:44:57,833 --> 01:44:58,916
Cal!

1499
01:45:11,333 --> 01:45:12,500
Holy shit.

1500
01:45:14,625 --> 01:45:15,625
Jack.

1501
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:20,625
Run.

1502
01:45:21,750 --> 01:45:23,707
No way, man.

1503
01:45:23,708 --> 01:45:26,082
For a guy like me,
there's worse ways to go out

1504
01:45:26,083 --> 01:45:28,000
than by trying to save Santa Claus.

1505
01:45:31,250 --> 01:45:32,458
Gryla!

1506
01:45:33,541 --> 01:45:34,750
It's time for you to go.

1507
01:45:36,208 --> 01:45:38,832
Oh, I'll go,

1508
01:45:38,833 --> 01:45:42,124
but I'm taking him with me.

1509
01:45:42,125 --> 01:45:44,957
You're not taking him anywhere.

1510
01:45:44,958 --> 01:45:48,624
His power has been wasted
for far too long.

1511
01:45:48,625 --> 01:45:51,833
The punishing begins tonight.

1512
01:45:52,916 --> 01:45:55,499
You're gonna have to go through me first.

1513
01:45:55,500 --> 01:45:57,332
With pleasure.

1514
01:45:57,333 --> 01:45:59,665
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah.

1515
01:45:59,666 --> 01:46:01,749
Ooh, ooh, cha, cha.

1516
01:46:01,750 --> 01:46:03,415
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah.

1517
01:46:03,416 --> 01:46:05,457
Ooh, ooh, cha, cha.

1518
01:46:05,458 --> 01:46:08,790
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah. Ooh, ooh, cha, cha.

1519
01:46:17,958 --> 01:46:22,999
You imbeciles have no idea
how to talk to a woman like this.

1520
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,041
A real woman.

1521
01:46:27,166 --> 01:46:28,750
She's my ex.

1522
01:46:30,666 --> 01:46:32,832
Hello.

1523
01:46:32,833 --> 01:46:33,999
My love.

1524
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:35,665
Get out of here, Krampus.

1525
01:46:35,666 --> 01:46:38,832
I can't do that.

1526
01:46:38,833 --> 01:46:43,665
And lovely as it is
to see your miserable face,

1527
01:46:43,666 --> 01:46:48,416
my brother has somewhere to be.

1528
01:46:57,458 --> 01:46:59,415
Just like old times.

1529
01:47:31,083 --> 01:47:33,791
Haven't you had enough?

1530
01:47:35,375 --> 01:47:37,999
If you want to take him,

1531
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,333
you're gonna have to kill me.

1532
01:47:41,416 --> 01:47:43,415
Gladly.

1533
01:47:43,416 --> 01:47:45,540
Your sacrifice will mean nothing.

1534
01:47:45,541 --> 01:47:47,375
Gryla!

1535
01:47:49,708 --> 01:47:52,207
Enough!

1536
01:47:53,375 --> 01:47:57,040
Any last words
for your most faithful warrior?

1537
01:47:57,041 --> 01:47:59,208
Only one.

1538
01:48:00,666 --> 01:48:03,124
<i>Kavalame!</i>

1539
01:48:09,416 --> 01:48:11,333
Merry Christmas, Witch.

1540
01:48:25,625 --> 01:48:27,249
No!

1541
01:48:36,375 --> 01:48:37,957
No.

1542
01:48:41,708 --> 01:48:43,415
- No!
- Well, look at you.

1543
01:48:43,416 --> 01:48:45,499
Oh, shut up!

1544
01:48:48,583 --> 01:48:49,916
Nick.

1545
01:48:51,333 --> 01:48:52,416
You okay?

1546
01:48:54,375 --> 01:48:55,708
Yeah.

1547
01:48:59,625 --> 01:49:01,249
What took you so long?

1548
01:49:19,583 --> 01:49:22,790
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

1549
01:49:22,791 --> 01:49:25,958
Let's not get mushy.

1550
01:49:27,041 --> 01:49:28,290
Thank you, brother.

1551
01:49:31,416 --> 01:49:34,374
Merry Christmas...

1552
01:49:34,375 --> 01:49:36,250
brother.

1553
01:49:37,916 --> 01:49:39,707
You want to maybe stick around a while?

1554
01:49:42,958 --> 01:49:44,708
Don't push it.

1555
01:49:47,291 --> 01:49:48,500
Get to work.

1556
01:49:50,333 --> 01:49:52,124
And you...

1557
01:49:52,125 --> 01:49:53,958
I want a rematch.

1558
01:50:00,583 --> 01:50:03,000
Happy Krampusnacht!

1559
01:50:09,666 --> 01:50:11,332
Oh, my God.

1560
01:50:11,333 --> 01:50:12,707
Honey, where are you?

1561
01:50:12,708 --> 01:50:14,832
<i>Mom,
you're not gonna believe this.</i>

1562
01:50:16,833 --> 01:50:18,540
<i>T plus
six minutes.</i>

1563
01:50:18,541 --> 01:50:19,957
Sky Train, this is Partridge.

1564
01:50:19,958 --> 01:50:21,540
Back in the chair and back on track.

1565
01:50:21,541 --> 01:50:23,290
<i>Good to
have you back, ma'am.</i>

1566
01:50:29,708 --> 01:50:31,707
We are currently
six minutes behind schedule,

1567
01:50:31,708 --> 01:50:34,249
so we're gonna run this preflight
like our hair's on fire.

1568
01:50:50,166 --> 01:50:51,707
Dylan.

1569
01:50:51,708 --> 01:50:52,999
Jack.

1570
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:54,749
- Hi.
- Hi.

1571
01:50:54,750 --> 01:50:56,041
Thanks for your help today.

1572
01:50:57,125 --> 01:50:59,124
He helped, too.

1573
01:50:59,125 --> 01:51:00,958
I know.

are go. Thirty seconds to launch.</i>

1575
01:51:10,291 --> 01:51:11,791
Hey, Drift.

1576
01:51:13,375 --> 01:51:15,625
Have a great ride.

1577
01:51:16,708 --> 01:51:18,708
Merry Christmas, Director.

1578
01:51:20,083 --> 01:51:21,875
Dylan. Jack.

1579
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:24,875
You guys coming?

1580
01:51:26,583 --> 01:51:28,165
-  What?
-  Really?

1581
01:51:28,166 --> 01:51:30,083
Come on, let's go. We got to roll.

1582
01:51:31,958 --> 01:51:34,874
Red One, you are clear for takeoff.

1583
01:53:03,416 --> 01:53:04,707
Copy that.

1584
01:53:04,708 --> 01:53:06,124
We're coming at you.

1585
01:53:44,166 --> 01:53:46,457
Yes! Yes!

1586
01:53:57,375 --> 01:53:58,999
He really does it, doesn't he?

1587
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,749
Goes everywhere
in the entire world in one night.

1588
01:54:01,750 --> 01:54:05,165
He's a lot cooler than I thought he was.

1589
01:54:05,166 --> 01:54:07,582
- And a lot more athletic.
- Yeah.

1590
01:54:07,583 --> 01:54:09,624
- Guy's a beast.
- The guy is a beast.

1591
01:54:38,666 --> 01:54:40,666
You're seeing it, aren't you?

1592
01:54:41,708 --> 01:54:43,500
Yeah, I knew you'd get it back.

1593
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,707
I lost it there for a while, Nick.

1594
01:54:46,708 --> 01:54:48,833
It's easy to lose it, Cal.

1595
01:54:50,208 --> 01:54:52,000
Important thing is to keep trying.

1596
01:54:57,916 --> 01:54:59,374
Nick.

1597
01:54:59,375 --> 01:55:01,291
I'd like to stay on.

1598
01:55:02,458 --> 01:55:03,791
If you'll have me.

1599
01:55:07,791 --> 01:55:09,541
You got it, Commander.

1600
01:55:16,041 --> 01:55:17,666
Did we just save Christmas?

1601
01:55:19,291 --> 01:55:21,582
I think we just saved Christmas.
